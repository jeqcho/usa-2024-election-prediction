https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/despite-progress-in-nevada-new-study-shows-voting-for-native-americans-harder-than-ever,True,"By Graham Lee Brewer, Associated Press OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A new study has found that systemic barriers to voting on tribal lands contribute to substantial disparities inNative American turnout,particularly for presidential elections, although Nevada was the lone state to close that turnout gap in 2022. The study, released Tuesday by the Brennan Center for Justice, looked at 21 states with federally recognized tribal lands that have a population of at least 5,000 and where more than 20 percent of residents identify as American Indian or Alaska Native. Researchers found that between 2012 and 2022, voter participation in federal elections was 7 percentage points lower in midterms and 15 percentage points lower in presidential elections than among those living off tribal lands in the same states. Earlier studies show voter turnout for communities of color is higher in areas where their ethnic group is the majority, but the latest research found that turnout was the lowest on tribal lands that have a high concentration of Native Americans, the Brennan Center said. “There’s something more intensely happening in Native American communities on tribal land,” said Chelsea Jones, a researcher on the study. Nevada, which has 28 federally recognized tribes, bands and communities located on 31 reservations and colonies, was among the 21 states included in the study. It was the only one thatbucked the trend, with 0.2 percent more voter participation by Native Americans on tribal lands than off of it in 2022. The state has passed bills in recent years, including after the period examined in the Brennan study, to boost participation. In 2021, Nevada lawmakers passed legislation allowing tribes to request a polling location or ballot drop box on reservations or colonies, and thenin 2023made those polling options on tribal land a requirement unless a tribe opts out. Nearly20 Nevada tribeshad a voting location or ballot drop box in use on tribal land in the 2024 election. Another 2023 billalso allowed tribal members to cast a ballot using the state’s Effective Absentee System for Elections (EASE) system, which allows military, overseas and some disabled voters to register to vote and cast a ballot online, without having to vote in person at a polling location. In Nevada’s 2024 general election, about 60 votes were cast by tribal members using the EASE system, and more than 6,000 voters used voting options on tribal lands, accordingto the secretary of state’s office. The office said initial turnout data for precincts that include tribal land was up 36 percent in 2024 compared with 2022, nearly double the statewide turnout increase over that period. Jones said the study suggests some barriers may be insurmountable in predominately Native communities due to a lack of adequate polling places or access to early and mail-in ballots. Many residents on tribal landshave nontraditional addresses,meaning they don't have street names or house numbers,making mail-in voting even more difficult.As a result, many Native American voters rely on P.O. boxes, but the study notes that several jurisdictions will not mail ballots to P.O. boxes. Long distances to the polls that do exist on tribal lands and little to no public transportation creates additional hurdles for Native American voters. In far-flung Alaska Native villages,polling places sometimes simply don't openif there's no one available to run an election, and severe weather can make absentee voting unreliable,The Associated Pressreported last month. “When you think about people who live on tribal lands having to go 30, 60, 100 miles (up to 160 kilometers) to cast a ballot, that is an extremely limiting predicament to be in,"" Jones said. ""These are really, truly severe barriers.” Additionally, Jones said they found Native American voters were denied the ability to vote using their tribal IDs in several places, including in states where that is legally allowed. All of these roadblocks to the ballot can create a sense of distrust in the system, which could contribute to lower turnout, Jones said. The Brennan Center study also highlights an ongoing issue when it comes to understanding how or why Native Americans vote: a lack of good data. “There are immense data inequities when it comes to studying Native American communities, especially as it pertains to politics,"" Jones said. Native American communities are often overlooked when it comes to polling data and sometimes when they are included those studies do not reflect broader trends for Indigenous voters, said Stephanie Fryberg, the director of the Research for Indigenous Social Action & Equity Center, which studies systemic inequalities faced by Indigenous people. “Generally speaking, polling is not well positioned to do a good job for Indian Country,” said Fryberg, who is also a professor of psychology at Northwestern University. “There are ideas that are held up as the gold standard about how polling works that don’t work for Indian Country because of where we live, because of how difficult it is to connect to people in our community.” Fryberg, a member of the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state, was one of several Indigenous researchers who denounced a recent exit poll conducted by Edison Research that found 65 percent of Native American voters who participated said they voted for Donald Trump. The poll only surveyed 229 self-identified Native Americans, a sample size that she said is too small for an accurate reading, and none of the jurisdictions in the poll were on tribal lands. “Right there, you’re already eliminating a powerful perspective,” Fryberg said. The Indigenous Journalists Association labelled that polling data as “highly misleading and irresponsible,” saying it has led “to widespread misinformation.” In a statement to theAssociated Press, Edison Research acknowledged that the polling size is small, but said the ""goal of the survey is to represent the national electorate and to have enough data to also examine large demographic and geographic subgroups."" The survey has a potential sampling margin of error of plus or minus 9 percent, according to the statement. “Based on all of these factors, this data point from our survey should not be taken as a definitive word on the American Indian vote,” the statement reads. Native Americans are not just part of an ethnic group, they also have political identities that come with being citizens of sovereign nations. Fryberg said allowing those surveyed to self-identify as Native Americans, without follow-up questions about tribal membership and specific Indigenous populations, means that data cannot accurately capture voting trends for those communities. Both Fryberg and Jones said that in order to create better data on and opportunities for Native Americans to vote, researchers and lawmakers would have to meet the specific needs of Indigenous communities. Jones said passage of the Native American Voting Rights Act, a bill that has stalled in Congress, would ensure equitable in-person voting options in every precinct on tribal lands. “This is not an issue that we see across the country,” Jones said. “It’s very specific to tribal lands. So we need provisions that address that uniquely.” ___ Graham Lee Brewer is an Oklahoma City-based member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team. Additional reporting by The Nevada Independent.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/analysis-how-redistricting-helped-nevada-democrats-but-not-enough-to-gain-supermajority,True,"Editor's Note: We recommend using Google Chrome to read this story for ease of viewing the article's infographics. For the first time in 20 years, Nevada went red in the presidential race — but the GOP’s gains didn’t trickle all the way down the ballot. Although Democrats failed to win a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, only one incumbent Democrat lost a legislative race, while the state’s Democratic congressional delegation swept their contests. There are many possible reasons — such as Democrats’ continued fundraising and ground game prowess and thenationwide trendof them overperforming Vice President Kamala Harris in local races — but another factor might have played an important role in Democrats’ down-ballot success: redistricting. In 2021, Nevada Democrats, thanks to holding the governor’s mansion and a majority in both legislative chambers,redrewthe state’s congressional and legislative boundaries in an effort to keep Southern Nevada U.S. House seats and maintain their stronghold in the Legislature for the next decade. It was a tall order given the pressure from community groups to ensure the voting power of minority groups and the need to account for population changes. So how did it affect this year’s races? The Nevada Independentanalyzed how the breakdown of voters from the two major parties in Southern Nevada’s legislative and congressional races might have changed if the old districts were still in place. Nonpartisans were not included in the analysis because of the uncertainty surrounding how they will sway. The analysis found that Democrats in Clark County largely benefitted from the new boundaries — particularly in Assembly districts where their winning margin was razor thin and Congressional District 3, the swingiest congressional district in the state where Democrats had prioritized shoring up their advantage. However, the races that cost the Democrats a legislative supermajority (which would have allowed them to overturn vetoes issued by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo) were uniquely disadvantaged by the new boundaries, which were drawn in part because of a surging population in southwestern Las Vegas. Click here to learn more about how The Indy conducted this analysis. In total, there were four races where the net change in an electorate’s partisan composition under the old districts was higher than the winning candidate’s margin, including Congressional District 3 and Senate District 11, the only race where a Democratic incumbent lost their seat this year. The findings underscore the benefits that Democrats have reaped from redistricting, while also revealing the process’ delicate nature that makes it difficult for Democrats to draw a supermajority-friendly map in a purple state such as Nevada. Because districts are supposed to be balanced in population, legislators had to maneuver around population changes that likely made it harder for Democrats to draw even more advantageous maps. Importantly, redistricting is required every decade under the Nevada Constitution to account for population changes. Additionally, candidates are uniquely focused on getting as many votes within their current district boundaries, so a candidate’s success under the new boundaries may be linked to how effectively they reached out to their constituents. Although officials from both parties acknowledged redistricting has likely worked out in Democrats’ favor, they also stressed that a variety of other factors might have played a role in the down-ballot election results, including fundraising, candidate quality and overall demographic trends in a given election year. Jeremy Hughes, a Republican strategist in Nevada, cautioned that the tides may turn in upcoming elections because he thinks Democrats had drawn boundaries to achieve a supermajority — creating more Democratic-leaning districts, but none particularly “safe” — rather than maintaining simple majorities with fewer but safer Democratic districts. “Republicans could take the majorities in both chambers by the end of this decade,” he said. Redistricting occurs every decade alongside the U.S. Census Bureau’s release of demographic data. Typically, the party in control of a state’s government oversees the redistricting process, drawing boundary lines to maximize its chances of success in legislative and congressional races. It’s also widely controversial. Districts have long been gerrymandered — often by Republicans — to dilute the voting power of minority groups, and eight states have created commissions composed of non-politicians to oversee the redistricting process. The Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning group,estimated this yearthat gerrymandering gave the GOP a 16-seat advantage in the U.S. House compared with if fair maps had been used, though the group's analysis did not account for Democrats' new advantage in Congressional District 3. There was also controversy over Nevada’s new district boundaries — congressional districts received an F grade and state Senate districts earned a B grade from thePrinceton Gerrymandering Project, a national group that grades the fairness of new district lines. State Republicans universally opposed the new boundaries as being too pro-Democratic, and community groups accused legislators ofinsufficientlybolstering the power of non-white voters by not grouping enough of them together that they could elect their preferred candidate. There has also been an effort to remove legislative authority over Nevada’s redistricting process in favor of an independent commission, but a ballot question to do so wasruled legally deficientearlier this year. Sondra Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada professor who helped lead the ballot initiative process, said she is considering a future ballot question that would require the Legislature to follow the state’s Open Meeting Law throughout the redistricting process. The goal would be to give citizens more advance notice of meetings when major decisions are made about the maps. Cosgrove also noted that the surge in nonpartisans — who, as of last year,make upthe largest share of registered voters in the state — might make it harder for parties to draw districts to their own advantage because of the uncertainty as to how nonpartisans will sway. “I don't know how much of an advantage gerrymandering is going to have in five years, six years,” Cosgrove said. Legislature Democrats sought a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, but they finished one seat shy in both chambers, with Republicans netting one seat in the Assembly and the parties breaking even in the Senate. In the Assembly’s closest races, Democrats appeared to benefit from redistricting more than Republicans. As shown in the graphic below, the electorate in six of the seven closest Southern Nevada Assembly races swung more to Democrats than Republicans. In two of those races — Assembly Districts 12 and 41 — the Democratic candidate’s winning margin exceeded how much the electorate swung to them because of redistricting. The one close Assembly race where Democrats didn’t appear to benefit from redistricting: Assembly District 9, represented by Speaker Steve Yeager, who had a closer-than-expected contest this cycle. Yeager did not respond to multiple interview requests. A Nevada Democratic strategist, granted anonymity to candidly discuss the implications of redistricting, said that although redistricting might have helped Democrats in these swing Assembly races, they thought the demographics of these districts played an even larger role. For example, Democrats appear to have performed well in Assembly Districts 29 and 37 — widely considered to be toss-up races ahead of the election — which rank among the whitest districts in Clark County. “The whiter and better educated [a district] is, Dems seem to have either maintained or even in some cases, picked up a little bit of ground,” the strategist said. However, in the one seat that cost Democrats their supermajority in the lower chamber — Assembly District 35, won by Republican Rebecca Edgeworth — the electorate would have swung toward Democrats by about 1.5 points under the old maps. The margin in the race was more than 8 percentage points, so it seems unlikely the older maps would have yielded a different result. In the state Senate, the race that cost Democrats their supermajority includes the same area as Assembly District 35 in southwestern Las Vegas. In Senate District 11, Republican Lori Rogich unseated Sen. Dallas Harris (D-Las Vegas), a result that became more possible because of redistricting. Under the new boundaries, the 2024 electorate in the district swung more than 7 points to Republicans compared with if the old boundaries were used, while Harris lost by less than 1.5 percentage points. Voters in Senate District 11 also narrowly supported President-elect Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris, while Biden won the precincts within the current district boundaries by more than 8 percentage points in 2020, the Democratic strategist said. Located in the southwest corner of the Las Vegas Valley, the district’s boundaries moved south, away from the bluer neighborhoods closer to the city center and incorporating the burgeoning population further south. David Damore, a UNLV political science professor, said the population surge made the redistricting process more delicate and uncertain because legislators were less sure how the new voters would sway. “That was the fastest growing part of the state in the last decade,” Damore said. In Senate District 5, the electorate swung 4 percentage points toward Republicans because of redistricting. Republican Carrie Buck ultimately won by nearly 7 percent, so redistricting was likely not a deciding factor in the race. Additionally, Senate District 15 in Washoe County flipped blue because of redistricting, but this analysis was not possible with the publicly available data in the Northern Nevada county. Congress The congressional results played out just as Democrats intended when they redrew the boundaries. The top priority during the redistricting process was shoring up Rep. Susie Lee’s (D-NV) Congressional District 3 by removing the more conservative areas of Henderson and Boulder City from her constituency. However, doing so would put another Democrat at a disadvantage. “It's all an interdependent system,” the Democratic strategist said. “So if you pull one lever or make one change somewhere on the map, you have to make corresponding changes elsewhere.” The victim was Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), who represents the 1st Congressional District — and she knew it. Shortly after the new districts were finalized, Titussaidshe “got totally f---ed by the Legislature.” She may have had a point.The Indy’s analysis found that the 2024 voting electorate in Congressional District 1 swung 14 percentage points toward Republicans compared with the old district, with registered Democrats only having a roughly 4 percentage point advantage over registered Republicans. Meanwhile, the electorate in Congressional District 3 swung toward Democrats by about 5 percentage points, more than Lee’s winning margin. Take the maps below, as examples. The first slide shows Titus’ old district as a rectangle in the Democrat-heavy center of the Las Vegas Valley, as shown through the smattering of small blue dots, each representing one voter in the 2024 election. However, redistricting shifted the boundaries to include the more conservative Henderson and Boulder City areas in the southeastern part of the valley, adding a reddish hue to her constituency. Meanwhile, the second slide shows how Henderson and Boulder City were removed from Lee’s district, and she was able to tap into some of the bluer areas in the western part of the valley. Ultimately, though, Titus won easily, and Lee eked her way to a victory by about 3 percentage points, her smallest election victory to date. Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), who represents the northern Las Vegas Valley and some rural areas, also coasted to victory. “If there's a 5 point national swing against your party, if you can still hold all your seats, [the districts are] pretty good,” Damore said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trumps-threat-of-mass-deportations-looms-large-for-undocumented-people-in-nevada,True,"Elias Benjelloun’s parents were issued their deportation orders quickly after President-elect Donald Trump first stepped into office in 2016. For the family, Benjelloun said,  the deportation order felt somewhat like a betrayal. Originally from the Netherlands, the family’s asylum case had been pending for decades before the FBI had granted them assistance after Benjelloun’s father — owner of a popular Las Vegas hookah lounge — reported information. But when Trump stepped into office, the FBI suddenly dropped the case. “They essentially kicked us to the curb,” 29-year-old Benjelloun, who remains undocumented, said. “It led to their deportation eventually.” Now for Benjelloun, as well as other undocumented Nevadans, the threat of deportation looms large again with Trump’s oft-repeated promise to conduct a mass deportation campaign. In Nevada, which has the largest per capita undocumented population of any state andthe largest share of mixed-status familiesin the nation,the effects of such a campaign could be especially pronounced. On top of separating loved ones, immigration advocates say that a mass deportation campaign could be widely disruptive to Nevada’s economy and cultural fabric. Michael Kagan, a law professor at UNLV and director of the UNLV Immigration Clinic, said despite the logistical hurdles of such a large and costly operation, the threat of mass deportations remains a “very real possibility.” During his first term, Trump put into place highly restrictive immigration policies that he could reinstate, such as expedited removal along the Southern border — which allows immigration officers to remove noncitizens without a hearing  — and the 2017“Muslim Ban,”which temporarily banned travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. If a policy such as expedited removal is expanded beyond the border, Kagan said it could speed up deportations and increase the number of people deported. “If an ICE officer thinks this person could be deported, and if they're not satisfied that this person has been here for two years, they could take them to deportation without going to a judge first,” Kagan said. The cost of a mass deportation campaign, however, could be extraordinary, withone reportfrom the left-leaning nonprofit American Immigration Council pegging the cost at $88 billion per year, totaling out to about $968 billion during the course of a decade. In addition to the operating costs of arresting, detaining and processing people, the U.S would need to build 24 times more  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers than currently exist, and more than 1,000 new immigration courtrooms to sustain the operation, according to the report. To supplement ICE, Trump said that he plans to use wartime powers anduse the U.S. militaryto conduct deportations,includingsending the National Guardfrom cooperating Republican-governed states into states that refuse to cooperate. Private prison companies have also already begun to work with Trump associates on coordinating mass deportations, and just this Wednesday, Texas offered Trumpmore than a thousand acres for detention facilities. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office did not respond to a request for comment on whether he would be open to deploying Nevada’s National Guard. If Lombardo resisted such a bid, however, Trump could bypass him through the Insurrection Act of 1807, which he haspreviously threatenedto use. Lombardo, who endorsed Trump during the 2024 presidential race,previously touted his rolein deporting 10,000 people when he served as Clark County sheriff. “There's a range of outcomes, but mass deportation of a kind that almost no one alive has ever experienced is a very real possibility,” Kagan said. Jiromi Peña, a 19-year-old student at UNLV, has been worrying about many of her undocumented loved ones since Trump’s re-election. She said many of her close friends, who are recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or other temporary protection programs, are worried that their legal status could be challenged. Meanwhile, her father, who has lived in the U.S. for decades, already has a backup plan to move back with family in Mexico, if deported. “I’m definitely scared,” Peña said. Still, Peña, who is a justice fellow withMake the Road Nevada, a progressive nonprofit immigrant advocacy group, said that she feels “ready for what his presidency has to bring.” Make the Road is already brainstorming plans to help undocumented people once Trump steps into office. This includes connecting them to legal services and expanding food pantries for those scared to get their own groceries, Peña said. Like Peña’s father, Benjelloun also has a backup plan. Since early November, Benjelloun has gone back and forth on whether to move back to the Netherlands to be with his parents and his sister, who was also deported. Benjelloun remains conflicted because he was raised in the U.S. and wants to continue his entrepreneurial career and his work on immigration reform. In his nearly three decades here, Benjelloun has distinguished himself, being the youngest elected student body president at UNLV and entering college at age 14. “I haven't seen my own parents in five years, and you know, I'm going to continue to be in limbo, and I'm not sure you know what is supposed to come next,”Benjelloun said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/whats-behind-nevada-latinos-shift-toward-trump-in-the-2024-election,True,"Ace Acosta, who, on top of his job as a food manager, has spent years organizing for Democratic candidates, wasn’t surprised former President Donald Trump won over more Nevada Latinos this time around. While knocking on doors throughout Las Vegas, the 29-year-old noticed that Latinos, especially younger ones, seemed to be hit especially hard by rising inflation and housing costs. Even thoughan average of pollsin the final three weeks before the election showed Vice President Kamala Harris had a narrow lead in Nevada, Acosta had an inkling that Trump was going to win. “The main issue is always the economy,” Acosta said. Polls just before andon Election Dayindicate that the group made a significant rightward shift this election, following a broader national trend.The 2024 American Electorate Poll of Hispanic Voters commissioned by UnidosUS,which surveyed more than 300 Nevadan Latino voters in English and Spanish, found that Harris trailed President Joe Biden’s level of 2020 support with the group by 6 percentage points, even though she led by a 2-to-1 margin. Trump, meanwhile, made resounding gains according to most polling. In 2020, 70 percent of Latino voters in Nevada voted for Biden, while only 27 percent backed Trump, according to the UnidosUS poll. In 2024, 64 percent supported Harris against the 35 percent of Nevada Latinos that backed Trump. The national exit poll even showed Trump winning over Harris among Latino voters, although exit polling’s accuracy has also been disputed because the data is self-reported and often captures a small set of voters. A more accurate picture is expected later from precinct-level analyses that consider actual votes cast and the demographics of precincts. Inflation, concern about border security and unfocused Democratic messaging all contributed to Trump’s increasing success with Nevada Latinos, according to more than half a dozen political consultants and Latino community leaders who spoke toThe Nevada Independent.They said that, like other demographic groups, many Latinos have becomedissatisfied with a political establishmentthat has seemingly made little progress on ensuring economic security and reforming the immigration system. In the months leading up to the race, both parties ramped up efforts to court Latino voters, which make up about 20 percent of Nevada’s registered electorate and about half of which are not members of either major party. Still, some pollsters contend that Latino voters were not the difference-makers in Trump’s victory — mainly because the group continued to be under-mobilized. In Nevada, 65 percent of Latino voters would have needed to vote blue in order to flip the state for Harris, but only 48 percent actually did, according to a UnidosUs’ assessment of exit polling. ”In past cycles, Latino voters were able to offset white majorities, but in this cycle, turnout differentials and sizable white majority were insurmountable,” said UnidosUS Vice President of the Latino Vote Initiative Clarissa Martínez de Castro. UnidosUS’ survey, which polled some 3,750 voters across battleground states in the days before Election Day, was one of the largest polls of Latino constituents nationwide with a margin of error of +/-1.01 percent. The economy Throughout the 2024 campaign, polling indicated time and time again that the economy was top of mind among Latino voters who, like other groups, felt the rising cost of living and prioritized that over other key issues such as immigration. Overwhelmingly,Americans were dissatisfiedwith Biden’s handling of the economy. “The most potent driver in the election was economic discontent, expressed in Trump's gains with most demographics,” Martínez de Castro said about the national Latino vote. The rising cost of living has been especially pronounced in Nevada, which has lagged behind the rest of the U.S. economy in its post-pandemic recovery.Nevadans on average are paying $1,195 more per monthfor the same goods and services as in January 2021  — higher than the national average — and housing costs have exploded,rising nearly 57 percent since the start of the pandemic. Jesus Marquez, a longtime Nevada-based conservative political consultant and former Trump appointee, contends that Harris failed to truly tackle Latino voters’ economic concerns. Her no-taxes-on-tips proposal was borrowed from Trump (the president-elect said he first got the idea in Vegas) and despite her promise to lower inflation, polling signaled thatHarris struggled to break freefrom being associated with the rising costs under the Biden administration. “Prices are still up in the sky … Latinos, Hispanic families, they're losing the American dream because of that,” Marquez said. Eddie Diaz, strategic director forThe LIBRE Initiativein Nevada, an arm of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, said that the multigenerational aspect of Latino homes added an additional complication to Latinos’ economic situations. One household he knows, he said, has three families living in it. Diaz contends that Latino men’s pronounced support for Trump, who are traditional familial breadwinners, can be explained by economic concerns. The Unidos pre-election poll showed42 percent of Latino men in Nevadasupported Trump and exit polls pegged that number at60 percent— an uptick from 2020 in both surveys. “I grew up in a household where men — my uncles, my grandparents, my father — took pride in taking care of their family and providing,” Diaz said. “When they're having a hard time where they have to go out and grab another job, they have their kids working or their wife, so they took notice of that, right? They want a better economy.” Even more left-leaning community leaders remain disappointed by Democrats’ economic messaging. Rudy Zamora, an organizer withChicanos Por La Causa, said that while he couldn’t pinpoint exactly why more Latinos supported Republican candidates this year, he feels that Latinos are often pigeonholed as a “single-issue community” that only cares about immigration. “As a young person with a family, I'm still trying to buy a house. Houses are still not affordable,” Zamora said. Latinos and ‘America First’ It wasn’t just the economy, but also the Trump campaign incorporating Latinos into the idea of an “America First” movement that was instrumental in growing conservative Latino support, right-leaning political analysts say. “We went on with the message of America first, meaning we care for you — for Hispanics — the policies of getting back our economy and lowering the price of everything,” Marquez said. A part of this was tapping into fears about border security. A big misstep of the Harris campaign, according to Israel Ortega, deputy communications director for Libre Initiative, was her failure to take a clear stance on immigration and border reform. During the Biden administration, the U.S.-Mexico bordersaw a record number of migrant encountersas President Joe Biden took steps to boost refugee admissions and provide deportation relief. For the many Latinos who are legal U.S. residents, it felt that these new immigrants were sidestepping the legal immigration process, Ortega contends. “​​Immigrants recognize the value of immigration, but just as important, Latinos value order, and knowing who's coming in and who's coming out,” Ortega said. Still, a mass deportation campaign —  which Trump has repeatedly promised to conduct — could have a major impact in Nevada, which has the largest per-capita undocumented population of any state. Nearly 34 percent of the state’s Latinos said their principal motivation to vote this year was Trump’s mass deportation policy, the UnidosUS poll found, although it did not say how many of that group supported or opposed the policy. An October pollfrom the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy also found that Nevadans favor expanding pathways to legal citizenship over a mass deportation campaign by a margin of more than 2 to 1. Mobilization Organizations such as Culinary Workers Union Local 226 and AFL-CIO, which have a large Latino constituency, have historically played a large role in the “Reid Machine” — the political operation built by the late Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) that has helped propel Nevada’s Democratic majorities. With more thanhalf of the Culinary Union’smembership being Hispanic, the makeup of the Reid Machine could explain why, historically, Latino voters in Nevada are contacted significantly more by Democrats than Republicans. This election cycle, 45 percent of Latinos surveyed by the UnidosUS poll said they were contacted by Democrats, versus the 30 percent contacted by Republicans. But this time around, conservatives borrowed some tricks from the Democrats in courting Latinos, something that was potentially key in increasing support. ""We went back to one recipe — that is the Democratic recipe,”said Marquez. Marquez’s own organization, theAmerican Christian Caucus— focused on “promoting conservative Christian values in Nevada” — tapped into community organizations such as Hispanic churches to begin their get out to vote campaign and recruit canvassing volunteers, knocking on thousands of doors, he said. Meanwhile, other groups such as the Elon Musk-backed America PAC and Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown’s campaign alsoupped their ground game.Although The LIBRE Initiative did not endorse a specific presidential candidate, it launched an “anti-Bidenomics” campaign and backed Brown. Republican outreach to Latinos has significantly increased as the state has become more competitive. In 2016, only 11 percent of Latinos were contacted by Republicans and only 18 percent voted for Trump, according to a 2020 UnidosUS poll. Meanwhile, that survey found that 35 percent were contacted by Democrats that year. Still, beyond the 2024 presidential race, the Democrats behind the Reid Machine are happy with its downballot successes, suggesting it still has a lead in mobilizing Latinos. Nonpartisan Chicanos Por La Causa took advantage of digital platforms in mobilizing Latinos in addition to the traditional ground game in its get out the vote efforts. Although they didn’t endorse a specific candidate, they endorsed Question 6, which enshrines the right to an abortion in the state Constitution, and were against Question 3, which would’ve opened primaries but ultimately failed. “Now with the younger generations, we're also having to meet them at where they are, which is online, which is Instagram, TikTok,” Zamora said. Fears about a Trump presidency Still, for many of the Nevada Latinos who didn’t vote for Trump, the future is filled with uncertainty and worry. Jessica Soria, a 39-year-old researcher and consultant, said that she worries Trump’s election will embolden machismo and colorism within the Latino community, which especially concerns her as the parent of a young son and daughter. She’s concerned that in the future, her daughter, who is darker-skinned, will face discrimination as a result of her color. “[Trump] gives permission for others to act in racism and hatred, because he moves in those ways,” Soria said. In the days following the election, Soria noticed a flurry of racist text messages circulating around social media and Latino family members disparaging Harris for her race and gender —  something that felt like a harbinger. It was “so painful for me,” Soria said. Soria isn’t alone in her worries. In Nevada, only 30 percent of Latinos believe that Republicans  “care a great deal” about Latinos, while more than 60 percent believe the same thing about Democrats, according to the UnidosUS poll. For Acosta, the Democratic organizer, it's not the Trump presidency that worries him the most, but rather Republican control of both the Senate and the House, which makes it more likely that some conservative anti-immigration policies will be passed. “They're gonna actually try to get to him to actually follow through on his rhetoric,” Acosta said. But despite Republican gains, Diaz is not so certain that Latinos’ rightward shift is a set trend. As the new administration kicks off in 2025, Diaz says that the LIBRE Initiative will continue to keep an eye on Republicans’ economic policies; the group wants to extend key provisions of the Tax Jobs and Cuts Act of 2017 that are set to expire,such as cuts to individual income tax rates.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevadas-top-election-official-eyes-changes-to-speed-up-ballot-counting,True,"Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar on Thursday admitted that he was frustrated by the pace of election results this year, and that he would be working with legislators to determine ways to speed up the counting of ballots. The results of tens of thousands of votes were not released until more than one day after polls closed, including a batch of 54,000 mail ballots in Clark County that were dropped off at election sites on Election Day. In an interview withThe Nevada Independent, Aguilar said many of the ballot counting difficulties likely stemmed from staffing levels in Clark and Washoe counties, despite efforts by both counties this year to accelerate ballot processing. Aguilar has been complimentary of how the state’s elections ran this year — and he reasserted Thursday that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud — but he acknowledged there is room for improvement. Notably, he suggested that the state wanted to work with the U.S. Postal Service to provide public data about how many mail ballots might be outstanding and when those ballots are expected to be received. Clark and Washoe mail ballots have markers that allow for tracking while they are en route to their final destination, but it was not available during this election cycle, leaving the public in the dark about how many mail ballots may be left to be counted. He said he has met with legislators about possible reforms and is “constantly in conversation” with the office of Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, whosaid after the electionthat he was also frustrated with the ballot counting processes, and that he would work to find a bipartisan solution next year. Meetings with Clark and Washoe officials are also scheduled. “I don't have definitive answers to any of the issues, but understanding the concerns are important,” Aguilar said. This was Aguilar’s first general election as Nevada’s top elections official, and the Democrat confirmed for the first time on Thursday that he would be running for re-election in 2026. Nevada officials had expected ballots to be counted faster this year thanks toenhanced technologyin Clark and Washoe counties, but Aguilar said both counties encountered difficulties. In Clark County, for example, Aguilar recalled seeing tabulation machines sitting idle on election night, even as the roughly 54,000 mail ballots dropped off at elections centers on Election Day were ready to be processed. “I think it's a staffing question, more than anything else,” Aguilar said. Stephanie Wheatley, a Clark County spokesperson, said that mail ballots received on Election Day started being processed late that evening, and that mail ballots could not be tabulated while officials were processing flash drives containing votes cast in person on Election Day Meanwhile, in Washoe County, officials were planning to use a new machine that can sort ballots and automatically verify signatures, but decided before Election Day to no longer automatically verify signatures. County spokesperson George Guthrie said at the time that it was not a reason for ballot processing delays. “The bottleneck there was the manual signature verification,” Aguilar said. “And again, it was human capacity, not machine capacity.” Guthrie declined to comment Thursday. Although Aguilar said he is unsure of what election reform might look like, he is not looking to change the state law that allows mail ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted up to four days after Election Day. He also indicated that there would not be efforts to cut down on in-person voting sites amid the continued popularity in mail voting because mail voting still made up less than half of ballots cast this year. This was also the first general election under the state’s newcentralized election management and voter registration systemthat was designed to speed up the state’s release of election results and reduce registration errors. Previously, the state operated under a bottom-up approach, with each county having its own processes for registering voters, running elections and reporting results. Clark County will merge with the new statewide system next year, which Aguilar said will allow things to go smoother. The new system hasreceived backlashfor further straining understaffed local election officials, who had to adopt the system on top of their many other responsibilities this year. The Legislature had required the project to go live this year, and Aguilar said he expects much less strain on local election workers because the system is now active. The state alsobroke its recordfor signature cures completed this cycle, resolving more than 23,000 signature issues on mail ballots but not counting a record 9,000 ballots because of ineligible signatures. Nevada requires those voting by mail to sign their name; that signature must match one on file with the state or the ballot will be flagged as needing a cure. Asked how this process can be improved, Aguilar pointed to how the share of ballots needing signature cures differed greatly in each county, with about 5 percent of Clark and Washoe mail ballots requiring signature curing, but that number being much lower in rural counties. “It's the consistency and training of the individuals that are going to do the signature [verification], making sure everybody's using the same standard that's required in state law,” Aguilar said. Although Aguilar said “there was no widespread fraud,” people continue to doubt the state’s election results, and dozens of Clark and Washoe residentsobjectedto the counties’ certification of the results last week, often because of how data was reported online. He said Clark’s entrance into the centralized voting system and working with the Postal Service to track mail ballots are ways to increase voter trust.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/two-moms-for-liberty-allies-joining-the-clark-county-school-board-what-happens-now,True,"Culture war issues centered in the Clark County School Board’s races will likely be a source of tension next year as two former members of a conservative parents group join the 11-member board. But some school district leaders see signs that they can work with the new members on more practical matters. Lydia Dominguez and Lorena Biassotti’s victories were part of themini red wavein Nevada that secured the Silver State for President-elect Donald Trump. During their campaigns, Biassotti (also known as Lorena Cardenas), who will represent District E, and Dominguez, who will represent District B, played up concerns around library books that mention sex, sexuality or gender identities and adistrict policythat supports students of diverse gender identities. It follows a 2017 bill,SB225, that was signed into law by Republican then-Gov. Brian Sandoval and requires all public schools, including charter schools, to address “the rights and needs of people with diverse gender identities or expressions.” Their messages were reinforced by the local Moms for Liberty chapter that launched in Clark County last year and has been pushing for these books to be removed from school libraries, accusing district officials and school staff of attempting to “groom” students. While the incoming trustees left the Moms for Liberty Clark County chapter earlier this year, they have both said they still support the group’s agenda. This platform is likely to be blocked by Trustees Linda Cavazos, Brenda Zamora and Ramona Esparza-Stoffregan, who had endorsed Dominguez and Biassotti’s opponents. The incoming trustee for District C, Tameka Henry, said in an Oct. 16 interview that she believes the school board should be focusing on improving students’ literacy rates rather than banning books. The incoming trustee for District A, Emily Stevens, said prior to the election that she had rejected an endorsement from the chapter. “I said … I'm not trying to be rude, but I don't want to be aligned with you,” Stevens said in a Sept. 24 interview. “You guys don't have a good reputation and I don't know everything that you stand for.” Cavazos has previously referred to the national organization as a “cancer” that should not be allowed to spread. But, in a written statement Monday, Cavazos said she’s personally not concerned about Biassotti’s and Dominguez’s addition to the board as long as everyone works collaboratively to benefit Clark County School District’s (CCSD) students. “Finding the commonalities among all members will allow us to prioritize goals, set and review policies that help implement and reach such goals as raising student achievement, improving the learning environment for both students and educators, and ensuring that all kids and staff are safe at school,” Cavazos said. Biassotti, who previously served as the chapter’s vice chair, did not respond to interview requests. Dominguez said in an interview last week that her priority won’t be pushing forward the group’s agenda and is instead focused on addressing the CCSD’s budget issues, calling for more transparency to restore the public’s trust in the school district and moving forward with the board’s upcoming superintendent’s search. A mother of two and Air Force veteran, Dominguez also plans to push for the school board to reconsider its decision earlier this year to not repair a Mount Charleston elementary school in her district that serves about 10 students and has been closed since August 2023 after it was damaged during atropical storm. “This is definitely a community issue, and it's a nonpartisan issue, and it's in the best interest of the kids,” Dominguez said. Children’s best interests But culture war issues have not totally left Dominguez’s mind. While she said she plans to work with district parents, staff, students and taxpayers of all backgrounds and affiliations, she won’t compromise on what she believes is best for children. Dominguez said she doesn’t believe in its children’s best interest when parents support changing their child’s gender identity or playing on a sports team that doesn’t align with their sex assigned at birth. “I truly believe that we need to protect girls in their spaces and their bathrooms and sports,” Dominguez said. “This isn't an attack on anyone on how they want to look or how they want to dress, but I just believe that we need to protect those spaces for girls.” Dominguez calls for an audit of all CCSD library books to identify any materials containing sexually explicit content. “This is about protecting children and ensuring our libraries remain appropriate spaces for students of all ages,” Dominguez said in a Wednesday written statement. She added that she has not discussed this with anyone from Moms for Liberty nor does she have a list of specific books in question. Last Thursday, the schooltentatively approveda change to its regulation oninstructional materials, which includes the process for challenging school library books. The revised version, which requires a second approval by the board before its implementation, states that supplemental textbooks and library books will remain available for use while they are under the review process, unless a committee decides otherwise. If a school’s library committee opts to remove a book or if a decision is appealed, a central committee would conduct a final review. CCSD librarian Glenda Alberti told the school board last week that the changes would shore up weaknesses in the challenge process that could be exploited by individuals submitting challenges. Cavazos elaborated on the policy’s goals in a written statement. “We need to rely on our professional educators (librarians and central staff), to guide us through any concerns that parents or community members may have, and to do our best to listen to all voices in an attempt to reach a resolution,” she said. Moms for Liberty Clark County chapter Chair Yadusha Jones questioned the timing of the proposed revision, which is scheduled for a second hearing, and possible vote, Dec. 12, in a Nov. 15social media post. “It’s hard not to see this as a way to silence the new trustees and push out a last hooray,” she wrote. “Parents should have a say in what their children are exposed to.” Dominguez said she also is looking forward to seeing what the new Trump administration will mean for K-12 education. While on the campaign trail, Trump said that on his first day he wouldcut fundingto “any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.” It's unclear how such a policy would play out in CCSD if enacted. Asked about Trump's comments, Cavazos said she was worried about anything that might affect students' ability to obtain the best education possible and to feel safe at school. Dominguez said the comments underscore a push for schools to refocus on academics rather than ""divisive or inappropriate sexual content.” Dominguez added that she is particularly excited for the changes expected from Trump’s pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who hasvowed to removeprocessed food from schools, citing health concerns about additives and dyes. Finding common ground One area where Dominguez and Cavazos meet eye to eye is on the future of Earl B. Lundy Elementary School. In June, the boardtook no actionon the district’s recommendation to close the school on Mount Charleston, leaving Lundy students in limbo. The boardrevisited the issuein August and voted 4-3 against a proposed $6.6 million repair for the school, and instead voted 4-3 in favor of asking the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District to allow the school district to build out classrooms at its Mount Charleston library branch. That’s expected to cost the district about $1.4 million, and wouldn’t be open until spring 2026. Dominguez’s predecessor, Katie Williams, who had appointed Dominguez to the district’s Attendance Zone Advisory Commission, was among the four trustees who voted against the school’s repair plan, citing cost concerns. The decision was made amidst speculation that Williams no longer resided in Nevada, which was eventually confirmed by the law enforcement officials beforeWilliams resignedin September. “I was very disappointed that Katie voted against it,” Dominguez said. After the election, Dominguez joined Lundy families, District B appointee Nakia Jackson-Hale and Chris Giunchigliani —  a former Democratic state lawmaker and Clark County commissioner who has been an advocate for Lundy families — to see the elementary school. While they didn’t go inside the building, Dominguez said she didn’t see any water damage inside the classroom, but did see some damage to the school’s exterior. “However, I still believe that that school needs to be reopened,” Dominguez said. “I would like to bring that back to the board.” Giunchigliani said Dominguez’s willingness to take an initiative on the Lundy issue signals to her that Dominguez will be willing to reach across the political aisle to work with other trustees on issues that matter to her. “She's smart, she cares, and she'll read,” Giunchigliani said. “I like people that like to read and do their homework, so I think she will be one of those people.” Cavazos, who voted against Lundy’s closing and supports repairing it instead, is in favor of revisiting the matter. “It is very unfortunate that the [Mount] Charleston community did not have a trustee actively representing them during the timeframe that decisions were being made on this issue,” Cavazos said in a written statement. “Thankfully, that has now changed.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/big-voter-turnout-this-year-benefited-republicans-contradicting-conventional-political-wisdom,True,"By Nicholas Riccardi, Associated Press The 2024 presidential electionfeatured sky-high turnout, approaching the historic levels of the 2020 contest and contradicting long-held conventional political wisdom that Republicans struggle to win races in which many people vote. According to Associated Press elections data, more than 153 million ballots were cast in this year's race between Republican Donald Trump, now the president-elect, and Democrat Kamala Harris, the vice president, with hundreds of thousands of more still being tallied in slower-counting states such as California. When those ballots are fully tabulated, the number of votes will come even closer to the 158 million in the 2020 presidential contest, which was the highest turnout election since women were given the right to vote more than a century ago. ""Trump is great for voter turnout in both parties,"" said Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Tufts University. In Nevada,just shy of 1.5 million ballotswere cast statewide, for a 73 percent turnout rate in a state with more than 2 million active registered voters. More than 700,000 Nevadans used their mail ballot, and about 790,000 voted in person either during early voting or on Election Day. The former president's victory in both the Electoral College and popular vote — Trump currently leads Harris by nearly 2.5 million votes nationwide — also contradicts the belief in politics that Democrats, not Republicans, benefit from high-turnout elections. Trump himself voiced it in 2020 when he warned that a Democratic bill to expand mail balloting would lead to ""levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again."" That warning came as Trump began to sow conspiracy theories about using mail voting during the coronavirus pandemic, which he then used to falsely claim his 2020 loss was due to fraud. That claim led to a wave of new laws adding regulations and rolling back forms of voting in GOP-controlled states and an expansion of mail voting in Democrat-led ones, as the battle over turnout became a central part of political debate. Such laws usually have a miniscule impact on voting but inspired allegations of voter suppression from Democrats and cheating from Republicans. ""It's such an embarrassing story for proponents on both sides, because it's so obviously wrong,"" Hersh said. Though both sides are likely to continue to battle over how elections are run, Trump's high-turnout victory may take some of the urgency out of that confrontation. ""Now I think, you just won the popular vote, I think it'll quiet down,"" said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican data analyst and pollster who has long argued his party can succeed in a high-turnout election with a diverse electorate. Experts note that turnout in the seven swing states at the heart of the election was even higher than in the rest of the country. ""This was a campaign in seven states much more so than previous elections have felt like,"" Ruffini said. While the rest of the country shifted significantly from 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden won the popular vote by 7 million, or 4.5 percentage points, the outcome in the swing states was closer. The turnout story also was different. Turnout dropped from 2020 in noncompetitive states such as Illinois, which recorded more than 500,000 fewer votes than in the last presidential election, and Ohio, which reported more than 300,000 less. Meanwhile, the number of votes cast topped those in 2020 in the battleground states of Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which Trump won.Nearly 83,000 more ballotswere cast in Nevada in the 2024 general election than in 2020. Arizona's turnout was nearly even with four years ago, as the state continued to count ballots. Harris even met or topped Biden's vote totals in Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin, and turnout has far eclipsed that of the 2016 presidential election, when 135.6 million voters cast ballots in a race won by Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. The problem for Democrats is that Trump did better in the battlegrounds than four years ago. Turnout among registered Republicans in Nevada topped 87 percent. For Democrats, it was just over 80 percent. ""The Harris campaign did a pretty good job getting voters out who wouldn't have come out,"" said Tom Bonier, a Democratic data analyst. ""She did get her voters out. Trump got more."" Those Trump turnout victories included first-time voter Jasmine Perez, 26, who voted for Trump at Allegiant Stadium, home of the Las Vegas Raiders. ""I'm a Christian and he really aligns with a lot of my values as a Christian in America, and I like that he openly promotes Christianity in America,"" Perez said. Voting alongside her was Diego Zubek, 27, who voted for Trump in 2016 but didn't vote in 2020 because he figured Trump would win easily. He voted for Trump this year. ""I wasn't going to let that happen again,"" Zubek said. A key part of the GOP strategy was reaching out to voters such as Perez and Zubek, encouraging early and mail voting after Republicans had largely abandoned them in the past two elections due to Trump's lies about vote fraud. Conservatives mounted extensive voter registration and get-out-the-vote operations targeting infrequent voters, a demographic that many operatives have long believed would not vote for the GOP. More than half the votes were cast before Election Day this year, according to AP tracking of the advanced vote. That was the case in Nevada, where nearly1.1 million votershad cast a ballot before Election Day. During the campaign, Andrew Kolvet, a spokesman for Turning Point Action, a conservative group that ran a get-out-the-vote campaign with more than 1,000 workers in multiple battleground states, cited Stacey Abrams, a onetime Democratic candidate for Georgia governor, as an inspiration in his group's effort. Abrams' success mobilizing Black voters and other groups in her home state that were less likely to vote helped pave the way for Biden's 2020 win there. ""We saw that Trump has this amazing reservoir of low-propensity conservatives who needed a little coaxing,"" Kolvet said in an interview Friday. ""They didn't think their vote mattered, and their No. 1 pushback was they didn't understand, really, how to vote."" Kolvet acknowledged that conservatives long believed large turnout didn't help them but contended that's changed in the Trump era: ""Our ideas are more popular,"" he said. Whether it continues is up to what happens next in Washington. ""It's going to be up to conservatives to make good on those campaign promises,"" Kolvet said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/washoe-library-officials-scrambling-after-voters-shoot-down-funding-measure,True,"The wind was gusting outside the South Valleys Library on a recent afternoon, but inside, the air was calm. Cheerful “hellos” echoed in the otherwise quiet space as library staff greeted patrons. A mother, carrying an infant and holding the hand of her toddler, made her way toward the children’s section while a masked woman turned toward a shelf displaying new authors and titles. In a well-lit workspace near the magazines, several people typed away on laptops; an elderly man flipped through print copies of newspapers. The comfortable scene unfolds daily in a similar fashion across many of Washoe County’s 11 library branches. But that tranquility for library patrons and employees could be at risk following a vote by Washoe County voters that eliminates a key funding source for the library system, potentially reducing its budget by millions of dollars per year. Votersfailed to approvea funding mechanism that would have allocated money collected by the county to the library system for 30 more years — an outcome that observers say could be linked to confusion over the question’s wording and aversion to taxes.The library system relies on the funds — roughly $4.5 million per year — for everything from purchasing new books to paying staff and providing internet services. With the failure of the ballot question, the county will continue to collect those funds from Washoe County taxpayers — taxes will not be lowered for residents. And commissioners could still opt to direct funding toward the libraries — or they could reroute the funds to another department entirely. “We don’t assume the commissioners will give us the funding for it. Voters said commissioners should determine the budget,” Library Director Jeff Scott said. “Right now, we’re just planning for the cuts.” The Nevada Independentreached out to the county’s five commissioners for insight into the ballot measure. Jeanne Herman, who represents District 5, said she hasn’t given it much thought yet, while Alexis Hill, chair of the board, said she doesn’t want to see a reduction in services. Having libraries open at night and on weekends is “an essential service,” she said. “I have been a strong supporter of libraries and I see their role in helping all constituents in this county,” Hill said. “I think there was some confusion on the ballot initiative.” Since the measure passed, some voters have realized their “no” votes were made erroneously and asked library staff what they can do. Another Washoe County library user has started anonline petitionencouraging county commissioners to continue to fund the library system at the same level — thousands of county residents have signed it thus far. “When people come in and realize they had voted ‘no’ and what that could mean for the library, they are upset. Not every single person, but anecdotally, we’ve heard from a lot of patrons who did not realize what they were voting against,” said Jennifer Cole, librarian at South Valleys Library. Understanding the ballot question Each year, Washoe County commissioners allocate about $12.5 million to the library system, with about 90 percent of those funds paying for staff. The rest of the library system’s funding comes from money generated through a tax “override” that has been in place since 1994. The override mechanism that was approved by Washoe County voters 30 years ago redirects funds the county already collects from taxpayers, which would otherwise be funneled into the county’s coffers, toward a specific target — in this case, Washoe County libraries, thus bypassing, or “overriding,” approval by county commissioners. Two cents of every $100 of assessed valuation is redirected to the county’s libraries, generating roughly an additional $4.5 million each year. That additional money funds 23 staff positions and almost the entirety of the system’s $1.4 million book budget and $400,000 technology budget. Funding from the override has been used for construction of the Northwest Reno, South Valleys, Incline Village and Spanish Springs libraries, as well as renovations to branches in Sparks and downtown Reno. But the override — narrowly approved in 1994 — sunsets in June. Washoe County Ballot Question 1 asked voters whether to renew the measure, but voters had to study the question to understand it was not proposing a new tax, but rather extending one that already existed. Library staff could not campaign for the initiative, but the system did run a voter education campaign explaining how the tax has supported libraries over the past 30 years. Freedom to Read Nevada, a political action committee, also supported the renewal. Hill, the county commissioner, said there was a missed opportunity for library supporters before the election. “You have to campaign for months and months before an election,” she said. “There was not a long enough campaign on what that initiative was.” There was no organized effort against the measure, said Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party and a member of the committee that drafted language against the ballot measure, only word-of-mouth efforts encouraging proper accounting of taxpayer dollars. When voters checked “no” next to Ballot Question 1 — as more than 51 percent did — they were voting to end an earmark toward the expansion fund. Going forward, the county will continue to collect the two cents per $100 of assessed valuation from taxpayers, but commissioners can direct that money elsewhere. If thequestion had passed, the library system was planning to renovate South Valleys and Spanish Springs libraries, build a new North Valleys library and expand its Bookmobile and book vending machine services in the North Valleys, Spanish Springs and South Valleys areas. Instead, the Washoe County Library System is facing potential large-scale staffing cuts, and a near-zero book and technology budget. Up to 30 of the system’s 130 employees could be laid off, Scott said — more than are currently funded with the tax override money in an attempt to offset the gutting of the book budget. Some of the smaller branches are already so lightly staffed that the only option to cut costs would be to reduce hours such as evenings and weekends, Scott said. “We’re still crunching the numbers,” he said. “We’re trying to avoid closing branches at this point, so we’re mostly looking at hours.” The funds generated through the tax override have helped renovate library branches. Often, donors will step in to help pay for the “cool” parts of a renovation, Scott said, such as the furniture. But the “boring” parts of the renovation — new carpet or paint — often aren’t included in donations, and the tax revenue helps offset those costs. In 2016, for example, the library system received a roughly $900,000 donation, with the stipulation that the money be spent within five years. In 2018, the downtown library was renovated; in 2022, Sparks and Northwest Reno received updates. “These facilities don’t get a lot of attention. Libraries are often lower rung,” Scott said. “No one’s going to say, ‘less cops, less firemen.’ It kind of makes it hard to get funding until things are falling around our ears.” Nevadans have a long history of supporting fewer taxes and lower costs of living. There is no state income tax, and Nevada has some of thelowest property taxesin the nation. In November, voters shot down tax increases across Northern and Southern Nevada. Carson City residentsdidn’t approve of two attempts by the city to raise funds for critical road repairs, whilein Henderson, voters overwhelmingly rejected property tax increases to update the fire department and fund the city’s libraries. “We heard loud and clear this election cycle [that] people wanted a change and felt priced out,” said Hill, the county commissioner. And while many Nevadans don’t want higher taxes, many do want to utilize their local library, at least in Northern Nevada. Roughly 60 percent of Washoe County residents — 263,000 — hold library cards, according to Scott. “The thing that’s hard about this, that’s really a gut punch, is we did a poll on this in June … and we had 68 percent [of those polled] support it,” he said. “It seemed almost a guarantee it would pass.” But as voters lined up at libraries across the county on Nov. 5, one out of every two people standing in line voted against funding the very building they were standing in, he pointed out. It’s not the first time the libraries have seen substantial cuts. Between 2009 and 2011, about 40 percent of the library system’s budget was slashed following the recession of 2008, with the county going as far as doing a feasibility study of what it would look like to close the libraries, Scott said. Going forward, the potential loss of $4.5 million annually feels like a step back in time, he added. “Hopefully this is all just catastrophizing at this point,” Cole said. “We are hopeful they will just go ahead and fund the library at the same level we’ve been funded.” ‘Confusion and regret’ Cole, the South Valleys librarian, has worked for Washoe County libraries for 20 years. She pursued a career as a librarian not just because of a love for literature, but because she enjoys customer service. “I love books, I love literacy, I love talking about books — that’s my most favorite thing — but that’s such a small, small part of what we do here,” she said. “I really love the work. I love helping people. Every job I’ve ever had has been about customer service. This job allowed me to provide that customer service that I’m good at and feed my passion for literature and knowledge and continuous learning.” South Valleys Library has the highest circulation of any of the county’s branches, lending roughly 600 books per day. But it’s not just a location to pick up books. The library, like the others in the county, pulls double duty, serving as a public meeting space, polling place and wildfire evacuation center. “There are so many ways we contribute to our community. It’s just what we do,” Cole said. “We’re here to serve the public. We’re probably the only county department that is 100 percent customer service driven.” Now, she and other staff members are being asked to evaluate programs to consider what could be cut. Across the library’s branches, flyers are being put into books waiting for pickup by patrons asking them to let county commissioners know they value library services. In Northwest Reno, Bradley Leavitt, a longtime Washoe County library patron, has started anonline petitionto present to county commissioners asking that funding continue to be directed to the libraries. The petition isn’t meant to overturn the ballot measure, he said, but to show county commissioners there is broad support for the libraries and that residents want to see them funded at the same level they are currently. The failure of the ballot measure, in part, is due to “misleading wording of the ballot question, which caused many voters to believe this was a new tax or tax increase,” according to the petition. “This misunderstanding likely swayed the outcome, despite the broad support our community has for the library system.” Thequestion asked votersif the county should “be allowed to levy an ad valorem tax in the amount of up to $0.02 per $100 assessed valuation for a period of 30 years …” “All over the internet I saw a lot of confusion and regret from voters who misunderstood the ballot measure,” said Leavitt — an avid reader who consumes 50 to 60 books a year, something he says he wouldn’t be able to afford without libraries. “I saw a lot of people who voted ‘no’ didn’t quite understand this wasn’t a new tax.” Thus far, roughly 5,000 people have signed the petition, and Leavitt and others plan on attending the county’s upcoming commission meeting to show their support for the libraries. “People online have been calling me a library lobbyist, in a negative sense, but if I’m going to be a lobbyist for anything, I’ll be a library lobbyist,” he said. Even Ron Aryel, a member of the committee tasked with drafting language for the Washoe County election guide against the measure, was disappointed to see it not pass. “I voted for WC1. I thought it was a commonsense thing,” he toldThe Nevada Independent.“I think it’s regrettable it didn’t pass. I think the library is an important service.” The library system does receive about $100,000 per year from Friends of Washoe County Libraries; other groups also make donations. Since the failure of Question 1, library patrons have been dropping off cash donations at various branches — donations that help, but won’t be able to offset the potential millions of dollars in cuts. Funding through the existing tax override runs through June 30 of next year. Library officials will present their budget proposal to Washoe County commissioners in January. What happens after that depends on the vote of Washoe County’s five commissioners. At least one person is confident the county will avoid steep cuts. “Our library system has always been funded by the county commissioners,” said Parks, the Republican leader. “I’m 100 percent confident our libraries will be properly funded. … Now they’re going to have to account for every penny and they’re going to have to justify that on their budget.” ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-democrat-jacky-rosen-won-nevadas-senate-race-in-a-trump-year,True,"A presidential candidate with a unique ability to turn out low-propensity voters. A Nevada senator running a state-specific campaign and keeping her party leaders at arm’s length. And an electorate much more interested in third-party candidates and the “none of the above” option in the Senate race than in the presidential race. In Nevada, 2024 proved to be somewhat of a 2012 redux — with the results flipped. Twelve years ago, then-President Barack Obama carried Nevada by a nearly 7 percentage point margin. But his coattails were limited — Democratic voters left the rest of the ballot blank, split tickets or voted third-party in the Senate race, and Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) won re-election by 1.2 percentage points. This year, the contours of the race were similar, but it was former President Donald Trump who turned out infrequent voters to win the state by about 3 percentage points. Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown was unable to reap the benefits, earning close to 10 percent fewer votes than Trump, in a race that only saw about 1.4 percent fewer votes than the presidential race. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), meanwhile, barely saw any dropoff from Vice President Kamala Harris, and even received more raw votes than her party leader in Washoe County and in the rural areas of the state. Like 2012, votes for non-major party candidates, including the “none of the above option,” were a relatively small percentage of the presidential race, but enough to change the outcome in the Senate race. The freshman senator attributes her success to localizing the Senate race, emphasizing her Nevada roots and commitment to bipartisanship and painting Brown as too extreme for the state. This allowed her to win even in a national environment that favored Republicans and keep enough registered nonpartisan and soft Republican Trump voters from picking Brown as well. “My race was always about me versus Sam Brown,” Rosen said in an interview. “I think that Nevadans knew me. [I’m] no stranger to being on the news, no stranger to being out there. I've lived in Nevada 50 years, and so I think that was the difference for me.” Brown was not available for an interview. Rosen’s margin of victory — 1.65 percentage points as of Nov. 17 — meant she outran Harris by 4.75 percentage points. Polls showed Rosen leading all cycle, often by double digits, even when they found Trump to be leading President Joe Biden by healthy margins. When Harris entered the race, polls found the presidential race to be a dead heat, with Rosen still winning outside the margin of error. In the last few weeks of the race, public polling showed the race getting closer — which internal polls in both campaigns had predicted all along — with Rosen still in the driver’s seat. Thefinal polling averagesshowed Trump favored by 0.6 percentage points and Rosen by 4.9. As it turned out, polling did account for the gap between the presidential and Senate races, but was about 3 percentage points too far left. Ultimately, Trump won by about 3 while Rosen held on by about 1.5 percentage points. Given the presidential margin, Rosen’s campaign believes that there was a lane for Brown to win. But the lack of much outside Republican spending until the fall — allowing Rosen to positively define herself on the economic issues that could have been a bigger weakness and negatively define Brown before he could introduce himself to voters — meant that the Republican push in the last few weeks was insufficient. And a combination of Trump-only voters and those who split tickets — either by voting for a third-party candidate, none of the above or for Rosen while voting for Trump — secured the race for her, despite the challenging presidential environment. The strategy was well-executed — and instantly familiar to Republicans who worked on Heller’s campaign, when a significant number of Black voters selected Obama and then a third-party candidate. “It wasn't that her ballot number with independents was something crazy,” said Jeremy Hughes, a Republican strategist who worked on Heller’s 2012 campaign. “It’s that his number wasn't. [They] made him not a choice. It was very similar to what we did to [Democratic candidate Shelley] Berkley in 2012. Berkley wasn't an option for people, and so they just were like, oh, I’ll vote over here.” The Rosen strategy Like most Democratic campaigns around the country, Rosen had a significant financial advantage. She decided to press it early — releasing her first campaign ad in April, while Brown was still mired in a primary, to positively define herself as a bipartisan dealmaker. She soon went on the attack, painting Brown as an extremist, particularly on abortion. In solo campaign expenditures, the Rosen campaign dropped $32.7 million on advertising to the Brown campaign’s $11.7 million, per ad tracking firm AdImpact. That cash disparity was especially notable during the summer, with the Brown campaign back in fundraising mode after the primary and most Republican outside groups yet to enter the fray. From mid-June through mid-August, Democrat-aligned groups spent at least $300,000 more than Republican groups each week; some weeks, their advantage was about $3 million. Brown’s campaign believes Rosen’s summer ad blitz helped boost his name identification, but that her unchallenged advertising created an advantage. It created a dynamic where Rosen was always on offense, and Brown was stuck perpetually playing defense. While leaning on her bipartisan reputation, Rosen was also unafraid to run on economic populism, touting her opposition to the Kroger-Albertson’s grocery merger, corporate home buying and high prescription drug costs. In a state as heavily working class as Nevada, where voters routinely ranked the economy as their top issue, it appears to have been the right message. “I don't care where you come from, what language you speak, what religion you have, whether you're young, old or somewhere in between, it's all about what happens around your kitchen table … to the people that you care about and that you worry about,” Rosen said, mentioning food prices. “You go to the market, the eggs, the chicken and the beef are too high,” she continued. “The rent — we have the corporate investors coming, jacking up the rent or the gas prices. So, [it’s about] talking about getting those big companies who are clearly ripping us off, making the profits. How do we fight that? Because that's hurting us at the kitchen table.” It was a similar strategy to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), whowonNevada in 2022 in an even closer race (less than 0.8 percentage points) as gas prices surged. Cortez Masto and Rosen laid the blame for high costs at the feet of corporations, while their opponents blamed the Biden administration. And while voters at the presidential level clearly resonated with the Republican interpretation, Rosen was able to separate herself and her race from the White House enough to win. Because the presidential race looked out of reach for Democrats when Biden was on the ticket, the Rosen campaign intentionally built a message to attract independent voters, preparing for the scenario that ended up occurring — a Trump victory in Nevada. In focus groups, they found that undecided voters, regardless of their personal belief on abortion, resonated overwhelmingly with their criticism of Brown’s support of a Texas abortion ban at 20 weeks that had no exceptions for rape or incest. Thus, Rosen constantly had ads spotlighting Brown’s past abortion position — even as he announced in February that he would not support a national abortion ban and supported exceptions. Although abortion may not have swung the presidential race, in Nevada, where more than 60 percent of voters supported a ballot measure to enshrine abortion protections in the state’s constitution, the Rosen campaign believes the candidates’ contrast on the issue was meaningful. Rosen also tried to keep the Senate race turning on Nevada, rather than national, themes — the goal being to emphasize the relationships she had built throughout her lifetime in the state, and particularly in the past eight years as a politician, compared with Brown’s six years as a resident of the state. Keeping it Nevada-specific, the campaign believes, also helped insulate her from the presidential red wave. “Rosen ran a really quintessential Nevada Senate race — problem solver, non-ideological, bipartisan, bringing home goods and services for Nevada,” said David Damore, a political scientist at UNLV. Multiple Republican strategists agreed. One, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said Rosen ran a “very smart” campaign reminiscent of the late Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) in his pre-leadership days, when his motto was “Independent like Nevada” and he looked for votes all across the state. In the north, she touted her successful efforts to partner with Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) and Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) to keep the U.S. Postal Service from moving its Reno mail processing operations to Sacramento. In the south, she lamented the cost of housing and hyped up her efforts to secure public funding for the Brightline train from Southern California to Las Vegas, a project expected to bring significant job and economic growth. And in rural areas, she ran ads about her support of ranchers and miners. The Rosen campaign also found in focus groups that independent voters were more likely to support her after hearing about times that she had stood up to Democrats, including on Nevada issues such as mining and solar energy. To that end, anadin which Rosen pledges to stand up to leaders of either party on behalf of Nevada was her opening and closing pitch of the cycle. The Brown campaign, meanwhile, struggled to pick one lane. At one point, it focused its attacks on Rosen’s 2017 violations of the STOCK Act, when she was late to publicly disclose automatic stock trades. Brown spent much of the debate pillorying Rosen for her campaign contributions from pharmaceutical companies and her personal wealth. In October, after the UNR women’s volleyball team forfeited a match against an opponent with a transgender player, Brown pushed that issue. But the Rosen campaign never cut a direct-to-camera ad addressing any of those issues, though they did respond to the STOCK Act hit — partially, a staffer said, because the Brown campaign never stuck with one line of attack long enough to warrant it, and mostly because the Rosen campaign knew that the strongest argument against her was not about her as a person, but about people’s frustrations with the economy. And a Rosen staffer also noted that she centered union labor throughout her campaign. While exit polling data is often unreliable, early returns suggest that at the top of the ticket, Democrats bled support among union voters throughout the country. Rosen, who filed for re-election, held a post-debate rally and gave her victory speech at different union halls, kept organized labor close — to say nothing of her longtime alliance with the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which she was a member of as a young adult. Of course, all of the Rosen campaign’s savvy would have been moot if Brown had been able to reduce the Trump undervote by even half — a source of great frustration to his campaign and Republicans nationally. The “none of these candidates” vote, a Nevada-only option that has oft played spoiler and that received 3.03 percent — nearly double Rosen’s margin of victory — stings in particular. A Brown campaign staffer said the campaign knew there would be an undervote — the amount was just larger than anticipated. Rosen only received 4,092 fewer votes than Harris; Brown got 74,159 fewer than Trump. Rather than evidence of a superior Rosen strategy, the Brown staffer said the Nevada Senate race is more indicative of poor voter education. The staffer recalled talking to voters who announced they had voted for Trump and skipped over the rest of the ballot, assuming that would solve their problems, without understanding that majorities in Congress matter. “Really what it came down to was just people not checking the box,” the staffer said. The Rosen campaign argues that they’re responsible for some portion of the undervote — by negatively defining Brown as an extremist before he could define himself, the campaign believes it was able to remove Brown as a viable option for enough voters to make a difference. “I don’t think that happened in a vacuum,” said Stewart Boss, Rosen’s campaign manager. “That was the product of conscious campaign decisions to make sure that Brown was not an acceptable choice for enough voters in Nevada.” Throughout the race, without the financial parity to compete with Rosen on the airwaves for long stretches, the Brown campaign tried to get creative with its outreach, focusing on generating organic media interest and hosting events and conversations with Latino voters, Asian American and Pacific Islander voters and union members, feeling that Republicans were underperforming with those groups. While the Brown campaign believes that they likely did improve their margins with those groups, the race ultimately followed a standard formula — the Democrat winning by big enough numbers in Clark County and narrowly winning Washoe County to offset rural losses. The GOP was optimistic about Brown’s candidacy at the very end of the race, when registered Republicans were turning out at higher rates than registered Democrats throughout early voting. They were so encouraged, in fact, that the Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC linked to Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), pumped over $6 million into the race to support Brown, its first Nevada expenditure of the cycle. But the electoral cake may have already been baked. “I think he got stronger in the last three weeks of the campaign or so, but by that time, people were already voting and had made up their mind,” Damore said. Crunching the numbers Rosen received nearly identical vote share to Harris in each of the state’s regions. But Brown lagged behind Trump everywhere. In Washoe County, for example, Harris won by 1 percent, but Rosen won by close to 6 percent, because Brown’s vote share was more than 4 percentage points lower than Trump’s. As in 2012, the disparity between the presidential and Senate contests was driven by votes against the non-major party candidates. This trend was most prominent in the rural counties, where more than 6.6 percent of voters chose neither Rosen nor Brown. Thus, Rosen only lost the rurals by 34 points instead of the 40 that Harris lost by. The 2024 Senate race is also drawing comparisons to the 2022 midterm. “What I saw in Jacky’s race was similar to mine,” Cortez Masto said. “There's a new baseline that we’re seeing now, moving forward, and we have to understand, most importantly, the nonpartisans, independents.” In each, the Democratic senator relied on Election Day and late-arriving mail ballots to put them over the edge. In an expanded universe of voters, Rosen’s margin was a little more than double double Cortez Masto’s slim 0.77 percentage point advantage. So despite their historic win in the presidential race in Nevada — the party’s first in 20 years — Republicans still have work to do to figure out how to win a Senate race in Nevada, which has eluded them since Heller’s victory in 2012. The Brown staffer said that future campaigns should learn that political outsider types such as Brown can run plausible, competitive races in Nevada, without buy-in from the Republican establishment and years spent working one’s way up the ladder. But some experts and operatives argue that a more savvy Republican operation in the state is needed to improve candidate quality for statewide races in the future — and to establish a better bench. “Until the Republicans can develop stronger candidates — I guess they’ve got four years until [Cortez Masto’s] back up — [there will be] a lot of missed opportunities,” Damore said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/clark-washoe-counties-certify-2024-election-results,True,"Officials in Nevada’s two most populous counties certified the 2024 general election results on Friday, the first official step in validating the outcome of the races. The Clark County Commission unanimously approved the results, while Washoe County Commissioner Jeanne Herman, a Republican, was the only vote against certification. Mike Clark, another Republican commissioner in Washoe, left the meeting and was absent from the vote. The certifications followed dozens of complaints from residents in both counties, who repeatedly accused officials of deleting votes, not counting ballots, intimidating voters and posting inaccurate ballot counts, even as election officials and prominent Republicans have called the election fair. The public commenters asked the officials to not certify election results, butelection certificationis a mandatory and nondiscretionary requirement of local officials. The scenes on Friday demonstrated the surge in efforts to block election certification based on claims of widespread voter fraud. Although the disinformation surrounding Nevada’s elections has been less pronounced this year than in the prior two election cycles, the efforts by then-President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn election results in states he lost four years ago have spurred electoral distrust and a steady stream of allegations of mass irregularities. The results will now go to the secretary of state’s office for final certification. The office alsoacceptsreports of election law violations. The certification in Washoe County was particularly closely watched after the county commissiondeclinedto certify results from two contested recounts in the June primaries, though iteventually certified the results. Clara Andriola, a Republican, was the only GOP commissioner to certify the general election results on Friday. Amid the increased tensions ahead of the election, panic buttons were installed at county vote centers, but they were only used once. In Washoe’s meeting, residents voiced outrage over the election administration, saying the county failed to be transparent, alleging without proof that their ballots were not counted, complaining that the media did not report Trump was ahead in the county before Election Day (Vice President Kamala Harris won the county by a slim margin) and asserting ballots were deleted. Clark, the GOP commissioner who did not cast a vote, left during the meeting amid the public complaints about the election results. During Clark County’s meeting, attendees carried charts and data that they said showed officials had systematically deleted or not counted thousands of votes in the election, though it is unclear how they reached those conclusions. Many commenters said that the county commissioners were “traitors” for certifying the results, and that they would be on the wrong side of history, while others also appeared to indicate that Trump would go after commissioners for certifying the results. Alongside the outrage, which was largely generalized complaints about the process instead of skepticism of specific race outcomes, progressive organizations and other citizens in both counties urged commissioners to certify the election. Washoe County resident Mary Richardson said she supports having the election certified and has worked elections in the county since 2016. Richardson said she has a banking background and has experience with dual custody and protecting information — something she said that the county also does well with during elections. “The elections are run with integrity,” Richardson said. Lindsey Harmon, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, began her public comment in Washoe County by quoting Nevada’s Republican National Committeewoman Sigal Chattah,who saidthere is “unfounded hysteria on Nevada’s Senate race and legislative races.” Harmon said it’s the role of the commission to certify the results. “I actually believe in democracy,” Harmon said. “Shame on you to the commissioners who have previously voted against certifying this election in the past.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/clark-county-discovers-1600-uncounted-ballots-but-results-unchanged,True,"Clark County officials on Thursday night discovered more than 1,600 ballots that were not originally counted in this month’s election, but the new votes did not change the results of any races. In a Fridaylettersent to Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, the county said the uncounted votes had been stuck in the “duplication stage” of the mail ballot counting process, but had since been counted and were always under county control. The letter said the county “would be conducting a thorough review of the mail ballot duplication process,” and the county said in a statement that it would be issuing an audit along with state election officials. When asked for more details about why these specific ballots were stuck in the duplication stage, county spokesperson Stephanie Wheatley said the county’s “statement speaks to the facts as we currently know them.” No election winners changed as a result of the new batch. In the Ward 2 race for North Las Vegas City Council — the closest contest in the county — incumbent Councilwoman Ruth Garcia-Anderson’s nine-vote lead shrunk to eight votes after the latest update. Still, the discovery of the ballots raises questions about how the most populous county in Nevada counts its ballots, especially because they were uncovered the day before county commissions across the state are meeting to officially certify the election results. Mail ballots in Clark County can be duplicated by a bipartisan team if they cannot be read by a ballot scanner, either because of physical damage to the ballot or because of how the voter marked the ballot. Aguilar said in a statement that his office “will work with Clark County to ensure this issue is properly investigated, appropriate accountability measures are taken, and we can be certain that this will not occur in the future."" In a statement, the Nevada Republican Party also called for “immediate action and full transparency” related to the uncounted votes, saying they raise “serious questions about election integrity and the handling of mail ballots.” The final day that new votes should have been added to counties’ totals was Tuesday, which was the last day that voters could cure their mail ballots if their signature was found to not match the signature in the state’s voter file (more than 9,000 votes werenot countedbecause voters’ signatures were not cured). Additionally, mail ballots postmarked by Election Day could not be counted if they were received after last Saturday at 5 p.m. The revelation of the ballots provides a rare case of a public election administration error in Nevada in a year where disinformation surrounding the state’s elections has been significantly lower than in past years. In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, then-President Donald Trump and his allies filed several lawsuits seeking to overturn Nevada’s election results based on debunked accusations of widespread voter fraud. Trump won Nevada’s six electoral votes this year, likely contributing to the lack of post-election uproar and litigation this cycle, even though there was a slew of (unsuccessful)pre-election lawsuitsfiled by Trump and his GOP allies. However, there have still been allegations of widespread voter fraud from Robert Beadles, a GOP megadonor based in Northern Nevada who has a history of spreadingradical conspiracy theories, ranging from mass irregularities in the 2020 election and that Jews are conspiring to take over the world. Beadles sent aletterto the Washoe County Clerk on Thursday alleging more than 100 election violations, including a breach of chain of custody and errors with the signature verification process. He has alsoaccusedDemocrats of rigging the U.S. Senate race against Republican Sam Brown, whoconcededthe race to Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) last week after losing by about 1.6 percentage points.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/union-backed-no-taxes-on-tips-policy-attracts-unlikely-fan-nonunion-red-rock-resorts,True,"Red Rock Resorts and Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which have been engaged ina decades-long feud, found common ground over presidential campaign pledges that would remove taxes on tipped wages. The locals casino operator and the state’s largest labor organization agree it would benefit Las Vegas hospitality industry workers. But that’s where the commonality ends. Red Rock Resorts executives said last week the tax reduction would provide more money for discretionary consumer spending, which would benefit the casino operator. But Culinary leadership clamped back on the comments, saying Red Rock employees, who lack union contracts, wouldn’t see any benefits from the company’s financial windfall. The issue percolated long before President-elect Donald Trump mentioned the ideaduring a June campaign rally at Sunset Park, saying he would call on Congress to end the taxation of tips as president. Taxes on income for hospitality workers increased by anywhere from 50 percent to 60 percent in 2022, nearly two years after the IRS — the federal agency charged with collecting taxes — loweredthe tip allocation rateto compensate for the lack of open hospitality businesses during the thick of the pandemic. The rate defines what workers would be reasonably expected to make from tips — and the IRS then taxes them accordingly. The new tip allocation rate ishigher than it was pre-pandemic, and the Culinary has been decrying that for more than two years. Trump first raised the no taxes on tips issue last summer, sayinghe was inspired by a waitresshe met at his non-gaming Trump International Hotel near the Strip. Duringan August appearanceat a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant, he directly pitched the Culinary for support at the ballot box. However, the 60,000-member union, which signeda new five-year labor agreementwith the Trump property in January, endorsed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who also expressed support for the idea. During Red Rock’s quarterly conference call two days after the election, an analyst asked executives what effect any election policies would have on the casino operator. “I think no tax on tips would be a positive for our business,” President Scott Kreeger said. Red Rock Vice Chairman Lorenzo Fertitta said an economic analysis of removing taxes from tips “could add somewhere in the neighborhood of about $200 million a year to the local economy, which, obviously, we would benefit from.” Red Rock, which operates seven Las Vegas-area properties under the Station Casinos brand, has been engaged in a feud with the Culinary, Nevada's largest labor organization, about unionizing most of the company's 13,000-person workforce. In June, the National Labor Relations Boardordered three of the company’s Las Vegas casinosto negotiate collective bargaining agreements with employees. But Red Rock is appealing the decision. The casino company’s Chief Financial Officer Stephen Cootey said the no taxes on tips policy would save the company $2 million to $3 million per year in payroll taxes. However, Culinary Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said Wednesday that the company only backs the idea because it improves the company’s bottom line. Pappageorge said Red Rock’s seven neighborhood casinos and seven smaller Wildfire properties benefit from five-year contracts the union negotiated with Strip and downtown resorts that included32 percent salary increasesfor employees. “Stations is milking off the great union contracts. Those workers spend their money [at the company’s properties],” Pappageorge said. “The company refuses to pass the money on to their workers. It’s not surprising that they talk about a $200 million windfall.” Pappageorge said the question is whether Trump can deliver on the no taxes for tips pledge. He said the union supported Harris because she had a plan to address theSubminimum Wage Act, which allows businesses in 34 states — but not Nevada — to pay less than the federal minimum wage for certain categories of workers. Fertittaand his brother,Frank Fertitta III— Red Rock’s CEO — each donated $9,900 to the Trump campaign in August, according to OpenSecrets.org. “There's going to be big pressure for Trump to deliver, and we’ll see if the MAGA bros in Vegas will step up and support their guy,” Pappageorge said. “You can’t just throw dirt on the wall and see if it sticks.” Alejandro Duhart, a room service server who has worked at Red Rock Resort since 2017, said his tip earnings would be affected because gratuity is automatically added to room service orders. “People just sign the check,” he said. “Some people are generous so I do see a few cash tips.” Members of Nevada’s congressional delegation support the no taxes on tips efforts while researchers at theBrookings Institutioncalled it “an answer in search of a question” in an op-ed, saying it could create inequities in the tax code. Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) and Rep. Steven Horsford signed on as co-sponsors of the bipartisanNo Tax on Tips Actthat was introduced in July but has not been acted upon by Congress. Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) said in a text message she doesn’t expect any no taxes on tip issues to come up before Trump is inaugurated Jan. 20. She said she thought the matter might be part of the administration’s tax package that she expects would be submitted before the tax cuts he pushed through in his first term expired.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/transgender-students-flood-crisis-hotlines-as-trump-pledges-to-roll-back-lgbtq-protections,True,"By Jocelyn Gecker and Sharon Lurye / AP Education Writers EDITOR'S NOTE: This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. Transgender youth in the United States have been flooding crisis hotlines since the election of Donald Trump, who madeanti-transgender themes central to his campaign. Many teens worry about how their lives could change once he takes office. During his presidential bid, Trump pledged to impose wide-ranging restrictions and roll back civil rights protections for transgender students. And his administration can swiftly start work on one major change: It can exclude transgender students from Title IX protections, which affect school policies on students' use of pronouns, bathrooms and locker rooms. One ad that aired over 15,000 times crystallized Trump's stance on rights for transgender and nonbinary Americans: ""Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you."" Through mid-October,Republicans had spentnearly $1.5 million airing variations of that commercial in Nevada. For one Alabama teen, the ad seemed to paint transgender and nonbinary people as a threat to society. The weekend before Election Day, the 16-year-old teen, who identifies as nonbinary and uses the pronouns ""he"" and ""they,"" called a crisis hotline at the Rainbow Youth Project. The group that serves LGBTQ+ young people has received more than 5,500 calls to its crisis hotline in the past 10 days, up from the 3,700 calls it typically gets every month. The teen was in despair and struggling with suicidal thoughts, according to his mother, Carolyn Fisher. She said she hadn't realized the depth of her child's depression and how painful it was for him to see political ads that felt like a personal attack. With the help of crisis counselors, Fisher said her teen has begun feeling better. But bullying at school has gotten worse, with some students telling her child Trump is going to make him ""go back in the closet,"" Fisher said. ""The kids who have taunted him are now proud of themselves, and they rub it in,"" she said. Opposition to transgender rightswas a focal point of Trump's campaign: Republican ads attacking political opponents over transgender or LGBTQ+ issues have aired over 290,000 times on network TV since March 2023, according to data from the media tracking firm AdImpact. The messaging may have resonated with many Americans. More than half of voters overall — and the vast majority of Trump supporters — said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide. President Joe Biden's administration expanded recognition of transgender rights just this year. Interpretation of Title IX, a landmark sex discrimination law, is largely up to the executive branch, although court rulings can affect enforcement. Originally passed in 1972, Title IX was first used as a women's rights law. This year, Biden's administration said the law forbids discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, but Trump can undo that. Biden's new guidance had limited implementation in any case: After a spate of lawsuits, courts had issued injunctions pausing the rule in 26 states. ""Title IX will be a top priority. It is emblematic of all the culture war issues that have been created over the past few years surrounding gender identity versus sex,"" said Candice Jackson, a lawyer who led the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights in the first Trump administration. Trump also has said he would ask Congress to pass a bill stating there are ""only two genders"" and to ban hormonal or surgical intervention for transgender youth in all 50 states. Most Republican-controlled states already have banned gender-affirming health care for transgender youth under age 18 or 19, and several have adopted policies limiting which school bathrooms trans people can use. While Biden's election-year guidance did not extend to transgender students in sports, Trump has promised to end ""boys in girls' sports."" The administration likely would ""approach these issues from a traditional understanding"" of what Title IX has meant, ""with a biological, binary understanding of sex,"" said Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary. In the U.S., 3.3 percent of high school students identify as transgender and another 2.2 percent question their gender, according to a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey released last month. The survey found 72 percent of transgender and gender-questioning teens experienced persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness in the past year. These teens also reported higher rates of bullying at school compared with peers. About 1 in 4 transgender students said they had attempted suicide in the past year, the CDC said. LGBTQ+ advocates are mobilizing to address the despair they see rising among transgender and nonbinary youth. The Rainbow Youth Project, for one, has increased virtual peer groups and town halls so LGBTQ+ youth can connect. Another organization, It Gets Better, has focused on reaching young people online through social media platforms like Twitch and YouTube to create supportive environments even if legal protections are rolled back, said Brian Wenke, the group's executive director. Across the country, particularly in conservative areas, LGBTQ+ youth are discussing whether it would be safer to live somewhere else. Jude Armstrong, a transgender high school senior in New Orleans, has led protests against Louisiana laws that regulated pronoun usage and discussions of gender and sexuality in the classroom. With the potential for federal changes on the horizon, Armstrong, 17, said he has thought of going to school in the United Kingdom, but worries about leaving behind the queer culture and history he loves at home. ""How do you feel like you're protecting your own community when you're leaving that community and going to another country?"" he asked. Alejandro Jimenez, a sophomore at Texas State University, dreams of being a theater teacher in Texas. He knows how important it is for trans kids to see someone like them in the classroom. Now, he's not sure if he'll stay in his home state. Already, tensions have risen on his campus in a way that makes him feel unsafe. The day after the election, two protestors held up signs that said, ""Homo sex is sin"" and ""Women are property."" ""I feel it's my duty to stay here, but I'm scared of being pushed out,"" said Jimenez, who is transgender. Under the new Trump administration, advocates worry efforts anywhere to accommodate transgender and nonbinary students could face scrutiny. Trump's platform called for pulling federal funding for any school pushing ""gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children."" ""It sounds really dystopian to say that trying to be more inclusive could actually result in punishment from the federal government. But that is a risk,"" said Elana Redfield, federal policy director for the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. With so much uncertainty, Eli, an 18-year-old trans college student in New York, stressed the importance of community, especially online for youth who feel concerned right now. ""You are not alone,"" said Eli, an ambassador for It Gets Better, who asked to be identified only by his first name for safety reasons. ""We will come out the other side. There are queer adults who have lived long and happy lives, and you will get there too."" Linley Sanders contributed reporting from Washington.  ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-breaks-signature-curing-record-9k-ballots-tossed-because-of-invalid-signatures,True,"Nevada broke its record for signature cures completed of mail ballots, as well as for votes that were not counted because of ineligible signatures in this month’s election. The signatures on more than 23,000 mail ballots were successfully cured in this month’s election — meaning election officials confirmed an eligible voter was linked to a ballot with a signature not matching the one in the state’s voter file, and the issue was resolved. Meanwhile more than 9,000 mail ballots had inadequate signatures and will not be counted. The total number of amended signatures exceeded the combined cures completed in 2020 and 2022, the only other general elections with widespread mail voting. In all, about 1.5 million votes were cast in the general election. The votes that were not counted mostly came from registered nonpartisans, while about 40 percent of the successfully-cured ballots were from Democrats and about a quarter coming from Republicans. The record-breaking data reflects the increased role of signature-curing in Nevada elections, as mail voting continues to be a popular voting method and younger voters with less experience signing their name enter the electorate. In the past few weeks, political parties and groups have launched robust signature curing programs to follow up with voters whose ballots were in limbo because of a signature mismatch concern, though it is unclear if any races were decided because of those efforts. In a statement, Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said “signature verification and curing are important elements of keeping our elections secure, but we can’t lose sight of every eligible voter’s fundamental right to have their ballot counted.” Aguilar, a Democrat, also said he plans to work with the Legislature next year to determine if the signature curing process can be improved. “It’s very disappointing that more than 9,000 Nevadans did not have their votes count this election due to the failure to have their ballots cured,” the statement said. Nevada law does not require an ID to vote, but it does mandate that voters sign their name on their mail ballot to verify their identity. The signature on a voter’s mail ballot must match the one on file with the state, which is typically the one associated with a voter’s driver’s license. Voters were also given the chance toupdatethe state’s record of their signature. Although leading candidates in all of Nevada’s federal and legislative elections did not change in the final days of ballot counting, last-minute signature curing has had an effect down-ballot. For example, in the race to represent Ward 2 on the North Las Vegas City Council, the winning candidate prevailed by nine votes after trailing by 30 votes before the final tally was released. Nevada law allowed voters to cure their mail ballot signature by 5 p.m. Tuesday, while all other mail ballots must have been received by 5 p.m. Saturday to be counted, meaning the final vote changes earlier this week were likely a result of people curing their signature and releasing their ballots to be counted. Three legislative races have seen particularly strong ballot curing operations. In Las Vegas Assembly Districts 12 and 41, Democrats helped cure ballots to help incumbentsMax CarterandSandra Jauregui, respectively, who both narrowly hung onto their leads, though it is unknown how the results may have changed without the curing efforts. In Senate District 11, Republican Lori Rogich maintained her roughly 1,000-vote lead to unseat Sen. Dallas Harris (D-Las Vegas), with both parties conducting signature cure efforts since Election Day. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226, the group representing Las Vegas hospitality workers, has conducted a signature-curing effort since late October, primarily focusing on helping Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), who won her race by about 23,000 votes, and Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), who prevailed by about 10,000 votes. The union, helped by 200 canvassers, knocked on more than 24,000 doors in Las Vegas and Reno and called and texted voters daily to get people to cure their signatures, spokesperson Bethany Khan said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/many-voters-backed-abortion-rights-and-donald-trump-a-challenge-for-democrats,True,"Sarah Varney, Kaiser Health News Voters in three states — Arizona, Missouri, and Nevada — voted last Tuesday to advanceprotections for abortion rightsin their state constitutions. Donald Trump, meanwhile, haswon all three statesin his victorious bid for the White House. It’s a conundrum for Democrats, who expected ballot initiatives on abortion rights in those states to boost the prospects of their candidates, including Vice President Kamala Harris. But data from VoteCast, a large survey of U.S. voters conducted byThe Associated Pressand partners includingKFF, found that about 3 in 10 voters in Arizona, Missouri, and Nevadawho supported the abortion rights measuresalso voted for Trump. “We saw lots of people who voted in favor of abortion access and still voted for Donald Trump,” said Liz Hamel, director of Public Opinion and Survey Research forKFF, a health information nonprofit that includesKFF Health News. VoteCast is a survey ofmore than 115,000 registered votersin all 50 states conducted between Oct. 28 and Nov. 5. It’s intended to be “the most accurate picture possible of who has voted, and why,”according to the AP. About 1 in 4 of the polled voters said abortion was the “single most important” factor to their vote, though that number was higher among Democrats, young women, Black adults, and Hispanic adults. Abortion rights referendums passed in seven states last Tuesday, including Missouri and Arizona, where state bans were overturned. Vice President Kamala Harris made reproductive rights a cornerstone of her campaign, but the VoteCast results reinforce earlier surveys that indicated economic concerns were the foremost issue in the election. Last Tuesday’s was the first presidential election since the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority overturnedRoe v. Wade. During Trump’s first term as president, he nominated three Supreme Court justices who later joined the 2022 ruling that eliminated women’s constitutional right to abortion care. Mike Islami, 20, voted for Trump in Madison, Wisconsin, where he’s a full-time student. He said abortion is “a woman’s right” that “was definitely in the back of my mind” when he cast his ballot. “I don’t think much is going to change” about abortion access during Trump’s second term, he said. “I believe his policy is that he’s just going to give it back to the states and from there they could decide how important it was.” The survey found that the percentage of voters who said abortion was the most important factor in their vote was similar in states that had abortion measures on the ballot and states without them. When voters cast their ballots, they were more motivated by economic anxiety and the cost of filling up their gas tanks, housing, and food, according to the survey results. Trump won those voters as much in hotly contested states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as in reliably red states. Glen Bolger, a Republican campaign strategist, said the 2022 election results demonstrated that Republican candidates are better off talking about the economy and the cost of living than they are about abortion. This year, Trump voters who supported abortion rights amendments may have decided to take Trump “at his word that he was not going to support a national ban,” Bolger said. In casting their vote for Trump, he said, those supporters may have thought, “Let’s elect him to deal with the cost of living and health care and gasoline and everything else.” The VoteCast survey found stronger support for abortion ballot initiatives from female voters: 72 percent of women in Nevada, 69 percent in Arizona, 62 percent in Missouri. Erica Wallace, 39, of Miami, voted for Harris and in favor of an abortion rights ballot measure in Florida, which fell just short of the 60 percent threshold needed to amend the state constitution. “As a grown woman, you’re out and you’re working, living your life,” said Wallace, an executive secretary who lives in Miami. She said the state’s ban, which criminalizes abortion care before many women know they’re pregnant, amounts to unequal treatment for women. “I pay my taxes. I live good,” she said. “I’m doing everything every other citizen does.” Men were more likely to vote against protecting abortion rights. Men voted 67 percent in Nevada, 64 percent in Arizona, and 55 percent in Missouri for the abortion rights ballot initiatives. The VoteCast survey found that, overall, voters believed Harris was better able to handle health care. That is consistent with the long-standing view that “Democrats traditionally have the advantage on health care,” Hamel said. Still, Trump outperformed Harris among more than half of voters who said they were very concerned about health care costs. Family premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance rose 7 percent in 2024 to an average of $25,572 annually, according toKFF’s2024 Employer Health Benefits Survey. On average, workers contribute $6,296 annually to the cost of family coverage. “Everybody is impacted by high health-care costs, and nobody has a solution to it,” Bolger said. “That’s something voters are very frustrated about.” Florence Robbins in Madison, Wisconsin, and Denise Hruby in Miami contributed to this report.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/certifying-this-years-presidential-results-begins-quietly-in-contrast-to-the-2020-election,True,"By Christina A. Cassidy and Ali Swenson, Associated Press ATLANTA (AP) — Local officials are beginning to certify the results of this year's presidential election in a process that, so far, has been playing out quietly, in stark contrast to the tumultuous certification period four years ago that followed then-President Donald Trump's loss. Georgia is the first of the presidential battleground states to start certifying, with local election boards scheduled to vote throughout the day Tuesday. As several suburban Atlanta counties certified their results without controversy, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger hailed Georgia's election as ""free, fair and fast."" Trump won Georgia and the six other presidential battleground states, after losing six of them to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. County certification meetings are scheduled later in the week in several other swing states — Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin. The lack of certification drama so far this week is a return to how the typically routine process worked before Trump lost his bid for re-election four years ago. As he sought then to overturn the will of the voters, he and his allies pressured Republican members of certification boards in Michigan to delay or halt the process. They also sought to delay certifications in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The boards ultimately voted to certify, but Trump's focus on certification caught on among Republicans. Some local Republican officials have refused to certify results in elections since then, raising concerns of a wider movement to reject certification this year had Trump lost to Vice President Kamala Harris. Some of that sentiment was present on Tuesday. Michael Heekin, a Republican member of the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections said he disagreed that certifying election results ""is purely a ministerial duty."" ""We should be the first line of defense, at least one of the lines of defense in examining the goodness and the accuracy of the election,"" he said. A lawyer for the county, which includes heavily Democratic Atlanta, explained during the meeting that certification was a necessary step before any election challenge could proceed. The Fulton County election board was scheduled to take its certification vote later Tuesday. Unlike Trump four years ago, Harris acknowledged her loss and conceded. Trump also won the popular vote for the first time during his three runs for the White House and praised the election results. Rather than descending on county ballot counting centers in anger, his supporters have been jubilant. ""This time four years ago, I was getting nasty phone calls constantly in my office,"" said Lisa Tollefson, the elections clerk in Rock County, Wisconsin. This year, she said, ""it's been very quiet."" That's not to say everyone is happy. Conspiracy theories surrounding this year's election are circulating within both parties. Following Election Day, left-wing conspiracy theories proliferated on TikTok, X and other social platforms as users questioned why Harris' total vote count was around 60 million — about 20 million fewer votes than Biden received four years ago. Some right-wing accounts twisted the narrative, falsely claiming the vote gap was instead proof that Biden's 2020 tally must have included fake votes. The claims didn't consider the fact that tabulation would take several days, including in Arizona and California, the nation's most populous state. As votes continue to be counted this week, Harris has made up ground and now has nearly 72 million votes, a number that will continue to grow. Counties and other local jurisdictions across the country will be conducting post-election audits of the vote over the next few weeks. Those typically involve hand-counting a certain number of ballots and comparing the results to machine tallies to ensure accuracy. Before local results are certified, the top election official typically provides the vote totals by candidate in each race along with how many voters cast ballots and how many total ballots were cast. Any discrepancies get reported and explained. ""The whole point of this period is to find those types of errors,"" said Kim Wyman, the former top election official in Washington state. ""They are making sure the results were accurate, that the election was accurate."" Every state will be going through the process, including presidential battlegrounds. Election certification meetings start Wednesday in Nevada, which backed a Republican in the presidential race for the first time in 20 years. The state's 17 counties have until Friday to certify, while Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat, and the Nevada Supreme Court must meet by Nov. 26 to finalize the statewide results. Arizona's 15 counties must certify by Nov. 21 and forward the results to the governor and secretary of state — both of whom are Democrats — for statewide certification four days later. In North Carolina, where election officials recovered quickly after Hurricane Helene devastated the western part of the state, election boards in all 100 counties were scheduled to meet Friday to certify results. Pennsylvania counties have until Nov. 25 to certify. Some larger counties were still reviewing and counting provisional ballots on Tuesday, the deadline for them to report unofficial results to the state. Litigation was possible with a U.S. Senate race hovering near the threshold for an automatic statewide recount. Michigan's 83 county canvassing boards have until Nov. 19 to review local results before forwarding them to the Board of State Canvassers. The four-member board, comprised of two Democrats and two Republicans, is scheduled to certify the results by Nov. 25. In Wisconsin, counties began the canvass process on Tuesday and have until Nov. 19 to certify. The Wisconsin Elections Commission will review the county reports and the chair — currently a Democrat — will certify the results by Dec. 1. The biggest potential problem in the state was identified on Election Day and corrected. Vote-tabulating machines used for mail ballots in Milwaukee were not properly sealed. A bipartisan decision was made to start over the process of counting the ballots once the problem was addressed. The state's nonpartisan top election administrator, Meagan Wolfe, said the election had been a success with no major problems. She attributed that to years of training and preparations by local election workers. ""Well-run elections do not happen by accident,"" she said. Swenson reported from New York.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trumps-win-brings-uncertainty-to-borrowers-hoping-for-student-loan-forgiveness,True,"By Cheyanne Mumphrey, Associated Press Savannah Britt owes about $27,000 on loans she took out to attend college at Rutgers University, a debt she was hoping to see reduced by President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness efforts. Her payments are currently on hold while courts untangle challenges to the loan forgiveness program. But as the weeks tick down on Biden's time in office, she could soon face a monthly payment of up to $250. ""With this new administration, the dream is gone. It's shot,"" said Britt, 30, who runs her own communications agency. ""I was hopeful before Tuesday. I was waiting out the process. Even my mom has a loan that she took out to support me. She owes about $18,000, and she was in the process of it being forgiven, but it's at a standstill."" President-elect Donald Trumpand his fellow Republicans have criticized Biden's loan forgiveness efforts, and lawsuits by GOP-led states have held up plans for widespread debt cancellation. Trump has not said what he would do on loan forgiveness, leaving millions of borrowers facing uncertainty over their personal finances. The economy was an important issue in the election, helping to propel Trump to victory. But for borrowers, concerns about their finances extend beyond inflation to include their student debt, said Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center. ""That's a big part of what is making life unaffordable for them is this burden of expenses that they can't seem to get out from under,"" Yu said. Student loan cancellation was not a focus of the campaign for either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, who steered clear of the issue at her political events. The issue came up just once in the September presidential debate, when Trump hammered Harris and Biden for failing to deliver their promise of widespread forgiveness. Trump called it a ""total catastrophe"" that ""taunted young people."" Biden promised the student loan cancellation program during his run for the presidency. From its launch, Biden's loan forgiveness faced relentless pushback from opponents who said it heaped advantage on elites and came at the expense of those who repaid their loans or did not attend college. Biden's first plan to cancel up to $20,000 for millions of people was blocked by the Supreme Court last year. A second, narrower plan has been halted by a federal judge after Republican-led states sued. A separate policy intended to lower loan payments for struggling borrowers has been paused by a judge, also after Republican-controlled states challenged it. Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the loan cancellation regulations. ""The Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass, blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,"" said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies. Overall,Biden's efforts were relatively unpopular, even among those with student loans. Three in 10 U.S. adults said they approved of how Biden had handled student loan debt, according to a poll this spring from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Four in 10 disapproved. The others were neutral or didn't know enough to say. Project 2025, the blueprint for a hard-right turn in American government that aligns with some Trump priorities, calls for getting the federal government out of the student loan business and doing away with repayment plans that pre-date the Biden administration. Even without directly addressing student loans, Trump has made promises that would affect them. He has pledged to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio. It's unclear which entity would take that responsibility if the department were eliminated, which would require approval from Congress. ""The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,"" said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump-Vance transition. Yu noted the Biden administration managed to cancel student loans for about 5 million borrowers, even though the signature forgiveness effort has been blocked. The administration did it by leaning into loan cancellation programs already in effect. For example, an existing student loan forgiveness program for public service workers has granted relief to more than 1 million Americans, up from just 7,000 who were approved before it was updated by the Biden administration two years ago. ""A lot of the cancellation that we saw in the last couple of years was because the Biden administration was committed to making the programs that are actually enshrined in law work for people,"" Yu said. Sabrina Calazans, 27, owes about $30,000 on federal student loans from her college days at Arcadia University in Pennsylvania. Her payments also have been on hold, but she could soon face a monthly payment of over $300. ""As a first-generation American, I live at home with my family, I contribute to our household finances, and that payment is a lot for me and so many others like me,"" said Calazans, who is originally from Brazil. In her role as managing director for Student Debt Crisis Center, Calazans said she has been telling people to stay up to date on developments by using the loan simulator on the Federal Student Aid website and reading updated information on forgiveness qualifications and repayment programs. ""There's a lot of confusion about student loans,"" Calazans said, and not just among young people. ""We're seeing a lot of parents take out more debt for their children to be able to go to school. We're seeing older folks go back to school and having to take out loans as well."" Associated Press education writer Collin Binkley in Washington, D.C.. contributed to this report.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/anatomy-of-a-red-wave-how-trump-won-nevada,True,"When Vice President Kamala Harris took over for President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in July, Democrats in Nevada were ecstatic. Something needed to change. Throughout the year, former President Donald Trump — who had never won Nevada in two prior attempts — wasleadingBiden in polling by significant margins. On the day that Biden dropped out, Trump’s lead in the polling average was nearly 6 percentage points. While Nevada is still counting ballots, Trump’s victory in the Silver State is likely to be just above 3 percentage points — a 5.5 point swing from 2020. That margin splits the difference between what polls found when Biden was at the top of the ticket, and the dead heat they projected with Harris in the race. So, Harris’ campaign did make a difference. But in interviews with a dozen political strategists, experts and elected officials, Nevada’s political class agreed that the fundamentals of the race — inflation, Trump’s appeal with working-class voters and Biden’s unpopularity — favored Republicans. Even the mighty Reid Machine — the political operation built by the late Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) that has built durable Democratic majorities — couldn’t overcome the red national headwinds and a Trump campaign that both parties agreed was better executed than his prior two — though the machine likely prevented further Democratic losses down the ballot. The Trump campaign’s — and its allies’ — all-in focus on low-propensity voters was the right strategy. A Republican operative familiar with the race, given anonymity to speak candidly, said the issue matrix gave the campaign endless opportunity to capitalize. To do so, Republican operatives made contact multiple times with those voters. The issues they heard about were the exact ones that Trump was running on — frustrations with the economy, concerns regarding immigration and fears about public safety. The operative said this was particularly common among people who work on the Strip, including union members. With an opening there — and armed with Trump’s promise to end taxation on tips — Republicans were able to turn skepticism about the Biden economy into votes for Trump through repeated contact. Republican voter targeting, multiple operatives said, was better this cycle than it had been in the past. “I just saw more organic support in Nevada than I've seen in a long time,” the operative said. “That is, for Republicans — specifically Trump.” Nevada, strategists agreed, is fertile ground for national headwinds in any direction, with relatively low political engagement and a high population of true swing voters. Given its demographic similarity to the nation, the state has typically swung with the popular vote — and 2024 was no exception. For the first time this cycle, registered nonpartisans outnumbered voters of either party, and, combined with registrants of third parties, ended up being more than 30 percent of the electorate. And, given the results, a clear theme emerged — voters, especially nonpartisans and those who are less engaged, were mad about the economy. And Trump had a clearer, simpler message than Harris — the people in power made prices high, and he would fix it. Add in high housing costs and an unpopular president, and it was the right formula for a red wave at the presidential level. “It's really hard to pinpoint any one particular factor, but I do think we had a bloc of voters who were still surly about the economy, still surly about inflation and prices,” said Peter Koltak, a Democratic strategist who worked on Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 2020 presidential campaign in Nevada. “Democrats, by being the incumbent party, we're always going to pay some penalty for that.” Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), who won in a swingy Clark County district despite Trump’s victory, put it succinctly. “You can talk until you’re blue in the face about what the causes of inflation are,” she said. “But when people's rents are going up and they can't afford it, and the cost of groceries are going up, and their paychecks are just not making it month to month, that's what they care about.” Changing Clark The story of Nevada’s shift from 2020 to 2024 can be told in its most populous county — Clark. In 2020, Biden won Clark by 9 percentage points. By 2024, key elements of its electoral composition had changed. For starters, Democrats’ voter registration advantage shrunk considerably. In November 2020, there were 12 percent more registered Democrats than Republicans, and the county had 1.32 million active registered voters. By 2024, with Nevada having implemented automatic voter registration, Clark has nearly 1.49 million registered voters. Democrats’ registration advantage was cut down to just 6 percent. The explosion of registered nonpartisans owes to the change, but the raw vote totals demonstrate how far more Democrats changed their registration than Republicans. There are about 54,000 fewer registered Democrats today in Clark County than there were four years ago; Republicans, meanwhile, have about 10,500 more voters in their party. Harris still won Clark County, but the margin showed why a statewide victory was impossible. Votes are still being counted, but her lead is less than 3 percentage points. As went Clark, so went the state — each moved about 6 percentage points to the right in the presidential race, relative to 2020. As of Saturday, Harris had won about 50 percent of the Clark County vote, the worst performance by a Democratic presidential candidate since 1996. David Damore, a UNLV political science professor, said “I thought I’d never see the day” when the presidential margin in Clark would be so close. There was also far less turnout in Clark — as of Saturday morning, just over two-thirds of active registered voters had turned out, while turnout exceeded 80 percent in eight rural counties. “There has to be something there about enthusiasm,” said Nevada Republican strategist Greg Bailor. Some of that can be attributed to a national environment that clearly favored Republicans, given nearly every state shifted to the right vis a vis 2020. Koltak said the election results show a “backlash on economic issues and on cost of living issues,” which spelled trouble for Democrats. “Those issues bounced back in Trump's favor and sort of hit the incumbent party,” he said. But experts in both parties also say the fundamentals in Clark County — with an electorate that’s highly working class and non-college educated — contributed. The makeup of Nevada voters played to Trump’s strengths overall in the cycle — while Harris improved her standing with college-educated voters, a group that’s relatively underrepresented in Nevada, Trump improved with Latino voters and Asian American Pacific Islander voters, who combined are close to 30 percent of the voting population. “Just like Florida saw a surge in GOP registrations post-COVID, we seemed to have had a mini surge as well,” said Republican strategist Jeremy Hughes. “It was a rapid acceleration of Republicans. I think some of that is probably due to our neighbors in California moving over, given the state of that state.” The Republican operative familiar with the presidential race agreed, saying that the in-migration to Clark County of Californians fed up with the state’s taxation and regulatory regime cannot be understated. The operative believes Trump’s margins could have been even closer in Clark County had the campaign and its affiliates spent more time chasing nonpartisan voters. A Democratic operative, given anonymity to discuss the race candidly, said that some signs of the party’s struggles with working class voters were present in past cycles. In 2020, Nevada was the only battleground state where Biden did not improve on Hillary Clinton’s margins. In 2022, it was home to the closest Senate race in the country, and the only blue-to-red gubernatorial flip. And given the economic pressures on the Nevada economy — which was hit harder by the pandemic than nearly any other state — it tracks that the electorate is highly sensitive to costs and inflation, the operative said. While Hughes said the shifts in voter registration should have been the “canary in the coal mine” for Democrats, he and others believe that a large portion of Nevadans are still truly swing voters, who don’t have a sticky partisan identity. For those voters, Hughes said that Trump’s campaign this go-around had the best messaging it has  had in three attempts. The focus on the economy and immigration dovetailed with swing voters’ concerns — frustration with high prices and record border crossings. The result suggests that swing voters were successfully persuaded — and that the Trump campaign, as it had been targeting all cycle, was effective in turning out low-propensity voters, especially those who voted for Trump at the top of the ticket and then did not vote for Republicans down ballot. Lee was the beneficiary of that trend. Lee said that she thought Harris was put in a “virtually impossible” position of trying to distinguish herself from Biden, the target of many voters’ anger regarding the economy and the border. She said Democratic messaging on the economy was never clearly communicated, and that the border was mismanaged until an executive order this year brought the number of crossings down. She said her messaging was centered on having a record of bipartisanship. “I spent the last several weeks calling undecided voters and having these conversations with them,” Lee said. “It's not a black and white issue, especially when it comes to the economy. I just think that the messaging got away from President Biden, and [Harris] had no ability to distinguish herself from them.” And the GOP wave wasn’t confined to any age group. Turnout data shows that Republican voters turned out at higher rates than Democrats across almost every age group. Jeremy Gelman, a political science professor at UNR, said this should dispel the notion that young voters sitting out of the election were responsible for Harris’ defeat. “Don't blame the young Democrat,” Gelman said. But operatives on both sides cautioned against assuming that the state is red now. George W. Bush famously won Nevada in 2000 and 2004 — and then the state didn’t vote for a Republican in the presidential race for another 20 years. Republican operatives said that nonpartisan modeling showed that among those who actively vote, they often agree with Republicans on the issues but are turned off by the national brand. The political future of Clark County — in the immediate term — may be determined by how those voters react to an economy and border that’s now Trump’s responsibility. Trump’s strength was in persuading low-propensity voters not just to turn out, but to vote for him — and the inability of other Republicans to do so down-ballot suggests the phenomenon is somewhat limited to the former president. “We've got to keep pressing on our advantage,” Hughes said. “Just as soon as it went one way, it can go the other.” Current, not a wave Despite Harris losing Nevada, Democrats had success down-ballot. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) eked out a closer-than-expected victory over Army veteran Sam Brown, and the three Southern Nevada members of the U.S. House all retained their seats. And while Democrats failed to secure a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, they prevailed in most of the swing districts. Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Union, said “our takeaway is that we won big,” citing Democrats’ success in congressional races and many of the swing legislative districts. Notably, the one Democratic incumbent in the Legislature who is on track to lose — Sen. Dallas Harris (D-Las Vegas) — did not receive the Culinary Union’s endorsement, likely putting her opponent, Republican Lori Rogich, over the top. He thinks the Democratic messaging — and the vice president’s focus on kitchen-table issues — was spot-on, but she was disadvantaged by having only a few months to campaign, while Trump had four years. “Nevada Democrats were clear that they recognized the cost of living, and they won at the ballot box,” Pappageorge said. The contingent of voters who were effectively Trump-only voters is perhaps a silver lining for Democrats — and what kept other federal races in Democratic hands and kept Democratic incumbent losses in the Legislature to just one seat, despite the top-of-the-ticket red wave. While Koltak tipped his cap to Republicans, who he said clearly made improvements this cycle, particularly in urban areas, he believes Democrats still have an advantage in the suburbs — where midterm voters are more likely to reside. Koltak said the biggest question moving forward — for both parties — will be to see if the voters who cast a ballot for Trump but didn’t vote down-ballot this election cycle return to vote in two years. “There are a lot of Trump voters who are perhaps not otherwise, particularly partisan Republicans,” Koltak said. “Trump's strength is not necessarily — historically, or this year — transferable to other Republicans.” Republicans also suggested that, in the federal races, they were undercut by poor candidate quality. Trump being Trump will always turn out voters that only fill out the presidential section of the ballot, but they argued that better candidates will be able to capitalize on some of the fundamental shifts they see happening in Clark County in the future. Implications for the Reid Machine This was the first time that Nevada has gone red in a presidential race in the era of the “Reid Machine” — the massive Democratic political operation built under the late senator. A combination of a well-organized state party and an array of unions and interest groups doing massive get-out-the-vote operations, with the powerful Culinary Workers’ Union Local 226 at the center, the political machine Reid built in Clark County has delivered Nevada to Democrats before under tough circumstances. But with the state moving 6 percentage points to the right in just four years, was the machine broken? Experts and operatives in both parties were quick to dispel any thoughts of its demise. “I think the ground game is still incredibly important,” said Lee, who credited the Reid Machine’s focus on undecided and independent voters for keeping her in office. “I don't think the message is, for me, that the Reid Machine is broken. The message is that there was a [Trump] top of the ticket.” Lee’s two closest races have been in 2020 and 2024 — both times when Trump was at the top of the ticket, turning out voters who otherwise would stay home. Gelman, the UNR political science professor, said that thinking the get-out-the-vote operations were ineffective “is the worst lesson for Democrats to learn from this election.” “Those sorts of activities do increase vote share, and Harris' vote share is probably higher because they did it, and frankly, it saved Jacky Rosen,” Gelman said. “It probably saved a lot of those legislative districts in Clark County, the leaders of the state Assembly, in the state Senate.” Democratic operatives noted that in the swing states, where Harris competed and had a strong ground game, the rightward shift wasless pronouncedthan it was in other states — suggesting that although the ground game did matter, it just could not compete with the overall red headwinds. Wins like Rosen’s, they say, are evidence. The Reid Machine, according to the Democratic operative, prevented the red wave from extending down the ballot. As always, it identified likely Democratic voters and turned them out across the various voting methods. Democrats were optimistic about the remaining vote on Election Day, because it was disproportionately younger, diverse and nonpartisan. Election Day turnout was higher than in the past — but as it turned out, those were the exact groups where Harris bled the support she needed. In the future, the operative added, Democrats need to do a better job of speaking to working class voters, without whom electoral success in Nevada is impossible. That’s where the Reid Machine, which is well-practiced in candidate recruitment, fundraising, research and communications in off years as well as just the ground game during election cycles, can and should press its advantage. “Democrats have to figure out how to talk to and win the support of a diverse working class,” the Democratic operative said. “You cannot win nationally — or here — if you can’t hold your margins with working class voters of color who were clearly angrier about inflation and higher costs than about any other issue.” Susie Martinez, executive secretary-treasurer of the Nevada State AFL-CIO, said that despite Harris’ loss, “the Reid Machine is still alive and kicking.” Harris, she pointed out, performed better with local AFL-CIO union members this cycle than Biden did in 2020. Although she’s disappointed by Trump’s presidential win — and particularly concerned about what the threat of mass deportation could mean to the union’s Latino base — Martinez remains optimistic that the AFL-CIO will be able to successfully lobby as Trump steps into office and Nevada’s Legislature kicks off its 2025 session. “We'll be ready for the challenge, and we will do everything in our power to fight,” Martinez said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/analysis-harris-banked-on-wide-nonpartisan-support-in-nevada-it-apparently-never-came,True,"Ever since nonpartisans became thelargest shareof registered voters in Nevada last year, the results of this year’s presidential election were bound to turn on how such a prominent — yet unknown — group would sway. And based on preliminary data, they didn’t seem to break nearly as much toward Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris as she needed to offset big gains in the share of Republican registered voters since the 2020 election. In Clark and Washoe counties — Nevada’s two urban population centers that account for nearly 90 percent of the state’s registered voters — data through Friday morning show nearly 330,000 nonpartisans voted in the election, making up more than a quarter of the areas’ turnout, according to aNevada Independentanalysis of voter file data. Based on the assumption that Harris won 95 percent of registered Democratic votes and 5 percent of votes from registered Republicans in the two counties, she likely only received about 53 percent of the nonpartisan vote,The Indyfound. If Democrats want to turn Nevada blue again in the next presidential race, they’ll likely need to do better among nonpartisans, especially in the state’s two urban counties. Although nonpartisans turn out at lower rates than members of both major parties, they could still be a source of growing power and untapped potential because of their relatively younger age, according to interviews with experts and aNevada Independentanalysis of voter data. As of Nov. 1, nonpartisans made up more than one-third of active registered voters in Nevada, while the share of registered Democrats and Republicans did not surpass 30 percent. Ahead of the 2020 election, nonpartisans made up just 24 percent of the state’s active registered voters, while they were about one-fifth of the active registered voters after the 2016 election. Part of this surge is likely because nonpartisan is the default option for the state’s automatic voter registration program, which launched in 2020 and has grown the overall voter pool by hundreds of thousands of people. Despite relatively little information surrounding the nonpartisans’ voting behaviors, Democrats were optimistic they would have a significant advantage. As early voting turnout statistics showed big leads among registered Republicans over registered Democrats, Democrats remained confident that they would do well among nonpartisans. Jeremy Hughes, a Republican consultant, said he thought that wishcasting was misguided. “I think Democrats just based that on gut. I didn’t see any data that back that up. I never saw it in any of our numbers, any of our models,” Hughes said. Although it is not clear what motivated nonpartisan voters to behave the way that they did, there is still ample information about who makes up this voting bloc and where things might have shifted this year. And because Washoe County maintained its status as a purple region this year, and rural voters backed former President Donald Trump by similar margins as four years ago, Clark County provides the best case study. 2020 comparison Since President Joe Biden won Clark County by 10 percentage points in 2020, the share of registered Republicans in the county has shrunk slightly, while the share of registered Democrats dropped by a staggering 8 percentage points. Nonpartisans, on the other hand, soared 10 percentage points. This points to an environment where Harris would have likely needed to outperform Biden’s share of nonpartisans to make up for the loss in Democratic registration. Once again assuming that Harris won 95 percent of registered Democrats and 5 percent of registered Republicans, her miniscule lead in Clark County as of Friday morning meant that she likely only carried about 53 percent of the nonpartisan vote in the county. Using the same calculation in 2020, Biden likely won about 62 percent of nonpartisan voters in Clark County. However, David Damore, a UNLV political science professor, said the question remains whether this is opposition against Democratic candidates or simply a desire for a change from the party in power. “That's the question — is that the incumbent party effect, or is that a real partisan effect?” Damore asked. Untapped potential? However, because much remains unknown about the nonpartisan voting bloc, it could be a source of untapped potential for both parties. Jeremy Gelman, a UNR political science professor, described nonpartisans as being in three groups: closet Democrats, closet Republicans and distinctive voters with no true allegiance to either party, which he estimated was about 8 percent to 15 percent of the group. “I think parsing through where the nonpartisan voted from and what's motivating people to register as nonpartisan is the task of researchers, political journalists for the next two years,” Gelman said. “The challenge for parties is to [figure] out what is that [winnable voters group].” The age distribution underscores the group’s untapped potential. The more than 270,000 nonpartisan voters in Clark County this year had an average age of about 45, lower than Democrats (51) and Republicans (55), which experts said means they are likely to become more politically engaged as they age. Additionally, the turnout rate for nonpartisans was significantly lower than for Democrats and Republicans across all ages (again, perhaps a result of people being automatically registered as nonpartisans yet having no intention to vote), but also meaning there might be room for the voting bloc to grow in political relevance. Take the graph below, as an example. Notice that the turnout discrepancy was even larger among younger voters. Peter Koltak, a Democratic strategist in Nevada, said he is interested in learning how the nonpartisans’ behaviors varied depending on location. “It'll be very interesting to see who they are, as best we can tell demographically, gender, age, ethnicity and race,” he said. Greg Bailor, a longtime Republican strategist in Nevada, said winning over nonpartisans needs to be part of both parties' plans from the get-go. “There's not a scenario where we're going to have less unaffiliated voters anytime soon,” Bailor said. “If you're going to win in a state like Nevada, they have to be part of your day one strategy.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/reno-city-council-to-welcome-new-representative-after-ward-structure-revamped,True,"One new member will take a seat on the Reno City Council come January, a panel that was bound to look different regardless of the results of this year’s election. Brandi Anderson overwhelmingly won a seat representing the city’s newest ward followingredistricting effortsthat began several years ago and were completed in 2023. Previously, Reno’s city council was composed of seven members — five ward members, one at-large member and the mayor. The mayor and at-large member were elected by all Reno voters; voters would then also vote for a candidate to represent the ward in which they live. With redistricting, the boundaries of the five wards were redrawn to create a sixth ward, and there will no longer be an at-large council member. Instead, each council member will represent a different ward with the goal of reducing the number of constituents each serves and making council members more responsive to the community’s needs. The redistricting followed the passage ofAB36, a bill signed into law in 2017 following recommendations by the Reno City Charter Committee, a committee appointed by members of the Reno City Council and Nevada Legislature. Mayor Hillary Schieve, Ward 2 representative Naomi Duerr and Ward 4 representative Meghan Ebert were not up for re-election. Ward 1 Small-business owner Kathleen Taylor eked out a victory over challenger Frank Perez, a current city employee. She won by less than 300 votes in the race to represent Ward 1. Taylor is the owner of a small business that develops plans for transportation and infrastructure projects and previously served as an at-large member on the Reno Planning Commission. She was appointed by the council in 2022 to fill a vacant seat in Ward 5 in northwest Reno. Because of the city’s redistricting, portions of Ward 5 are now Ward 1. Perez, who works as a code compliance officer for the City of Reno and previously managed the city’s neighborhood revitalization program, ran on a platform focused on community safety and opportunities for seniors. Reno’s charter does not allow elected officials to simultaneously hold another position within the city. Ward 3 Incumbent Miguel Martinez bested newcomer Denise Myer in Ward 3, an area that houses the Wells Avenue Business District and neighborhoods around the Reno-Tahoe International Airport. Martinez was appointed to his position on the council in 2022; prior to serving on the council, he spent seven years at Truckee Meadows Community College as a recruiting coordinator. Myer, who ran on a platform focused on supporting small businesses and expanding the city’s police force, served as an internal safety auditor for a major airline for several years. She has ties to Robert Beadles, a prominent Republican donor and election conspiracy theorist — Beadles backed Myer in 2022 when she ran an unsuccessful campaign for county commissioner. Ward 5 Incumbent Devon Reese defeated newcomer Brian Cassidy. Reese, who works as an attorney, was appointed to the council’s at-large seat in 2019. In 2020, he ran for re-election and won. Cassidy, owner of Junk King Reno, a junk removal service, was backed by a political action committee affiliated with Beadles. Reese will take over the ward seat previously held by Taylor. Ward 6 The newly created Ward 6, which encompasses southeast Reno by Longley Lane and Veterans Parkway, will be represented by Anderson. She is a small-business owner and marketing consultant who previously ran unsuccessfully for Reno City Council in 2010. Anderson defeated Tom Heck, who served 22 years in the U.S. Air Force and is now retired. In 2022, he threw his hat in the ring as the Republican candidate for governor of Nevada, receiving just under 2 percent of the vote in the primary election.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/donald-trump-has-sweeping-plans-for-a-second-administration-heres-what-hes-proposed,True,"By Bill Barrow, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration. The former president andnow president-electoften skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers. A look at what Trump has proposed: ""Build the wall!"" from his 2016 campaign has become creating ""the largest mass deportation program in history."" Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He's pitched ""ideological screening"" for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he'd reinstitute first-term policies such as ""Remain in Mexico,"" limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not justcrack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall. Trump played downabortionas a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman's federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump's insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk — a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. But it's unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden's guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans. Trump's tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That's mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from the current 21 percent. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden's income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change. Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It's noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income — a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers. Trump's posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10 percent to 20 percent on foreign goods — and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy ""essential"" medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of ""any vital infrastructure"" in the U.S. by Chinese buyers. Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and forlegal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage. On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end ""boys in girls' sports,"" a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration's policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth. The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households' utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration — even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations — though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end ""frivolous litigation from the environmental extremists."" The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House. He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government's power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain. Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers' budget actions ""set a ceiling"" on spending but not a floor — meaning the president's constitutional duty to ""faithfully execute the laws"" includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress. As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work. The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage topressure K-12 school systemsto abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding ""for any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children."" In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his ""secret weapon"" against the ""Marxist Maniacs and lunatics"" he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect ""billions and billions of dollars"" from schools via ""taxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments"" at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights. As in other policy areas, Trump isn't actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online ""American Academy"" offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. ""It will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed—none of that's going to be allowed,"" Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023. Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients. As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the ""concepts of a plan."" In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of ""making America healthy again."" Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a ""hoax,"" blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed toreduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy – and transportation infrastructure spending – anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. ""Drill, baby, drill!"" was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards. Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America's workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden's push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump ""the union bosses and CEOs"" together as complicit in ""this disastrous electric car scheme."" In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, ""I'm telling you, you shouldn't pay those dues."" Trump's rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield — an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia's war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: ""peace through strength."" But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. ""I don't consider them leaders,"" Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans ""see on television."" He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary's Viktor Orban and Russia's Vladimir Putin. Associated Press reporter Amanda Seitz contributed. ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/incumbents-overwhelmingly-retain-positions-across-northern-nevada-races,True,"Northern Nevada voters overwhelmingly supported incumbents at the local level while also failing to fund basic county services. A ballot initiative funding critical Washoe County library services such as staffing and purchasing books failed, while proposed taxes in Carson City to close a growing deficit in the road-repair budget and fund much-needed work also were turned down by voters. Meanwhile, county commission incumbents in Washoe County and Carson City kept their seats, as did Carson City’s mayor. Races in Sparks remain too close to call. Here’s a look at the winners and losers of major ballot questions and political races across Washoe County and Carson City. In Sparks, one incumbent was ousted while two others retained their seats. Washoe County Library Expansion Fund Washoe County voters showed underwhelming support for their public libraries by failing to extend a 30-year tax initiative dedicated to funding the Washoe County Library System. Theballot initiativewould have dedicated 2 cents for every $100 of assessed property value to Washoe County libraries for maintenance, operation and construction — it is estimated $4.5 million would have been generated through it in the coming fiscal year. The initiative would not have added a new tax; instead, it would have extended the same small fee residents have paid since its inception in 1994. The original initiative funded the building and remodeling of libraries throughout the county. With its failure, librarians will be laid off, the county’s book and technology budgets will be eliminated and evening and weekend hours will be reduced or eliminated at various branches, according toWashoe library officials. Washoe County Commission District 1 Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill will retain her seat after being challenged by Marsha Berkbigler, the Republican whom Hill defeated four years ago to gain her current position on the panel. Hill, the only Democrat running for the commission this election, defeated Berkbigler in 2020 to represent District 1, which includes portions of the northwest and southwest Truckee Meadows, Incline Village and Crystal Bay. Berkbigler, a former lobbyist whose election bid receivedfinancial supportfrom Republican donor and election conspiracy theorist Robert Beadles, served on the commission for eight years until Hill defeated her in 2020 by about 10 percentage points. Prior to being elected to the commission, Hill served as the City of Reno’s arts and culture manager and special events program manager. Washoe County Commission District 4 Clara Andriola, a Republican who did not have the backing of the Washoe County GOP because of her failure to supportclaims of stolen elections or fraud, has retained her seat on the five-member commission. Andriola, who has served as executive director of the nonprofit Reno Rodeo Foundation for the past decade, was first appointed to the panel in 2023 by Gov. Joe Lombardo. Carson City mayor Lori Bagwell will retain her position as Carson City’s mayor after defeating challenger James Shirk by a wide margin. Bagwell previously held positions as a lobbyist, budget director for the Nevada Association of Counties and in the governor’s office. She was elected to the city’s board of supervisors in 2015 and as mayor in 2021. Shirk, a Navy veteran and retired business owner, served with her on the board of commissioners — he represented the city’s Ward 4 from 2012 to 2016. Carson City Ballot Question 1 Carson City residents shot down a sales tax increase to fund local road repairs. Since 1986, the city has had a 0.25 percent sales and use tax to fund maintenance and repairs on existing roads. In 2021, the Carson City Board of Supervisors and the Regional Transportation Commission directed Carson City staff toinvestigate optionsto increase funding for road repairs in the city. In 2022, a study found the city is facing an annual budget shortfall of $21 million to care for its roads, with the deficit expected to grow. Pavement conditions are particularly poor on neighborhood streets, which account for nearly three-quarters of the city’s streets. Ballot Question 1 would have increased the 0.25 percent tax on every $100 spent to 0.5 percent, the maximum allowed under state law. It is estimated it would have generated between $4 million and $4.5 million annually. Carson City Ballot Question 2 Carson City residents doubled down against an increase in taxes by also failing to pass an additional tax to fund road maintenance and repairs. Ballot Question 2 proposed a 1 cent tax on each $1 of valuation for vehicles registered in the city. It is estimated it would have generated $2.5 million annually. Carson City Supervisors Carson City Board of Supervisors Ward 2 representative Mo White will continue to serve on the panel. First elected in 2021, he was unchallenged in the election. Also retaining her seat on the panel is incumbent Lisa Schuette. Schuette will represent Ward 4 after defeating challenger Lucia Maloney. Schuette, who worked in public safety and education, was first elected to the panel in 2021. Sparks City Council One incumbent was voted off Sparks City Council while two others retained their seats. Kristopher Dahir, the current Ward 5 representative on the panel, lost to challenger Joe Rodriguez, the state’s assistant fire marshal. Rodriguez, who also serves on the Washoe County School Board, has previously served in the military and as a police officer. Dahir, who has served on the council for eight years, is also president of the Nevada Christian Institute and has served as a pastor for more than 30 years. In Ward 3, incumbent Paul Anderson defeated Brad Fitch. Anderson, a management professional who works for a company specializing in government contracts, was appointed to the position in 2018 and re-elected to the council in 2020. Fitch has worked for the City of Reno as a community liaison and as the arts, culture and special events manager. Ward 1 incumbent Don Abbott was automatically declared elected after receiving nearly 65 percent of the vote in the primary. Abbott was first elected to the panel in 2016 and was re-elected in 2020. In 2022, he was appointed mayor pro tempore (vice mayor). Updated at 5:20 p.m. on 11/13/2024 with final vote totals. ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-incumbents-hold-their-seats-in-closely-fought-contest-for-the-house-majority,True,"All three of Nevada’s incumbent House Democrats have won re-election in their Las Vegas-based seats — an expected result after Democrats far outspent Republican candidates who were largely left to fend for themselves by national GOP groups, but uncomfortably close at times for Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV). Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), whose district is reliably the safest for Democrats, won a rematch against 2022 candidate Mark Robertson in Congressional District 1. Lee, running in the swingy Congressional District 3, beat tax analyst and conservative opinion columnist Drew Johnson.And in Congressional District 4, which includes both North Las Vegas and vast swaths of rural Nevada, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) defeated former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee. Republicans paid the races little attention after coming away empty-handed in 2022. Two years ago, national Republican groups poured $28 million into these districts, with Lee’s race attracting special attention and operatives believing that the path to a House majority ran through Las Vegas. Republicans did get their majority, but Southern Nevada was not part of the equation. Titus, Lee and Horsford each won their re-election in 2022 Lee’s was closest, with a 4-percentage-point margin. This time around, Democratic incumbents were virtually unchallenged on the airwaves. In District 1, Titus and Democrats outspent Robertson by more than $2.4 million over the past two years. The difference was even more stark in the other two districts — Democrats spent over $9 million more than Republicans in District 3 and in District 4. That spending disparity — and a perception that the Republican candidates were relatively weak — led House Majority PAC, the main outside group associated with House Democratic leadership, to cancel millions in ad reservations for the final few weeks of the election, choosing to spend the money in more competitive races. That confidence was rewarded. For the fourth straight cycle, Las Vegas will be entirely represented by Democrats in Congress. Congressional District 3, which includes the southern and western parts of Clark County, from Laughlin to Summerlin to parts of Spring Valley, has close to equal numbers of registered Democrats and Republicans. Lee, who has represented the district since 2018, has always won close races, and this year’s contest — despite her vast spending advantage — was won narrowly. After the first results — encompassing the early vote and mail that arrived during early voting — were posted, Lee led by less than 1 percentage point. That lead built somewhat, up to just over 1 point, with Election Day votes and mail arriving on Election Day morning. By Thursday morning, once Clark County had posted the results from mail ballots left in drop boxes on Election Day, Lee’s lead moved up to about 2.3 percent. With more mail ballots — which have favored Democrats — to come in Clark County, including mail arriving from the U.S. Postal Service on the evening of Election Day, the day after and the few ballots that will arrive through Saturday, Lee’s margin is likely to increase slightly. Her closest race came in the last presidential cycle — 2020 — when she won by about 3 points. The 2024 race might challenge that result to be Lee’s closest, depending on the size and margin of the final mail ballots. Titus and Horsford have larger leads. Benefitting from the lack of Republican spending, Titus is winning by about 7 points, a margin that could increase with more mail ballots. She won in 2022 by 5.6 percentage points. Mail ballots are outstanding in Nye County, a red area of Congressional District 4, so Horsford’s margin will likely be reduced. But he currently leads by 8.5 percentage points, meaning the race is well in hand. In Northern Nevada, meanwhile, Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) was elected to a seventh full term, fending off a nonpartisan challenge from Greg Kidd. Kidd, a wealthy entrepreneur who self-funded his campaign, spent more than $4 million in advertising on the race, to Amodei’s $180,000. But Amodei won regardless. Amodei had won every House election by a double-digit margin, and Kidd appears to be no exception. Though mail ballots yet to be processed in Washoe County will improve Kidd’s margins somewhat, Amodei’s lead — of more than 20 percentage points — is well in hand. “Serving in this role is a tremendous responsibility — one that must be earned, not bought,” Amodei said in a statement in a shot at Kidd’s spending. “It was gratifying to see CD-2 was not up for auction, but rather decided based on who voters trust to best champion Nevada values and priorities.” None of Nevada’s representatives yet know if they will be serving in the majority or the minority. With several competitive races yet to be called, control of the House has not yet been determined. If Democrats take the majority — the less likely outcome — the Las Vegas representatives will see their influence grow. Titus, who will be the longest-serving House member in Nevada history if she completes her term, is in line to chair a subcommittee in the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee. Lee, who will begin her fourth term in January, has steadily risen the leadership ranks in key caucuses, including the Bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and the center-left New Democrat Coalition. And Horsford serves on the Ways & Means Committee, the influential tax writing panel where much of the battle over the expiring Trump tax cuts will take place in 2025.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/changes-abound-for-southern-nevadas-local-governments-after-election,True,"One of the initial votes for Las Vegas Mayor-elect Shelley Berkley will be to settle the long-running land-use dispute between the City of Las Vegas and the owner of the defunct Badlands golf course. The Las Vegas City Council agreed Wednesday to suspend a vote settling the case until Dec. 18, allowing attorneys for the city and Badlands owner Yohan Lowie to continue negotiating a dollar amount to resolve the case. By the time the city council considers a settlement, Berkley will have been sworn in as mayor. An item to discuss and vote on a plan to settle the nine-year legal matter by paying between $250 million and $286 million to the developer, wasannounced last week. The settlement range is far below the $450 million to $650 million taxpayers would have been facing in lawsuits filed by the developer. “I would love for it to go through,” Berkley said Wednesday, hours after she was declared winner of the Las Vegas mayoral race, defeating Councilwoman Victoria Seaman by nearly 13,000 votes as of Wednesday evening. Seaman, who has two years remaining on her term representing Ward 2, made the motion to bring the matter back to the council next month. She sat in on one of the settlement talks. “I'm confident that we will have a good settlement,” Seaman said. On Thursday, Seaman conceded the race to Berkley ina social media post. Berkley, 73, who spent 14 years in Congress before narrowly losing a high-stakes U.S. Senate race in 2012, said she was ecstatic about winning a race to represent her hometown. She will be sworn in Dec. 4. Berkley said her initial effort will be to meet with the city’s department heads, getting to know her way around city government and focusing on her campaign issues, such as homelessness and helping businesses and developers. She compared moving into Las Vegas City Hall to her first days in Congress and as CEO of Touro University Nevada, a private medical school in Henderson. She said she has to be a fast learner. “I always remember that overwhelming feeling during orientation for representatives [in Congress],” Berkley said. “But I figured it out relatively quickly, and think I did a very credible job for my constituents.” MayorCarolyn Goodmanwas term-limited. She succeeded her husband, mob lawyer Oscar Goodman, who began the family’s hold on the office in 1999. Berkley was endorsed by four of the council members — Brian Knudsen, Olivia Díaz, Nancy Brune andCedric Crear, who finished third in the mayoral primary with almost 19 percent. Meanwhile, Berkley will be joined on the city council by Democratic Assemblywoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong, who defeated Democratic former Assemblyman Cameron C.H. Miller in the race to replace Crear as the District 5 representative. Summers-Armstrong represents Assembly District 6 and Miller represented Assembly District 7 before his resignation. Summers-Armstrong had nearly 53 percent of the vote. Berkley said Wednesday morning she had yet to speak with Seaman, a former one-term Republican assemblywoman who was elected to the city council during a special election in 2019 to finish the term of a councilman who resigned. Clark County Commission Attorney April Becker will become the first Republican in 20 years elected to the Clark County Commission, defeating Assemblywoman Shannon Bilbray-Axelrod (D-Las Vegas) in the race to represent District C. The seat is being vacated by Democrat Ross Miller, who didn’t seek re-election. As of Wednesday evening, she led her opponent by 7 percentage points. In an interview Wednesday, Becker said she doesn’t want her constituents to think about her party registration. “I'm not going into this office as a Republican. I'm going in as a person who cares,” Becker said. “I want people in my district to know that they can contact me if they have a problem and don't think that I won't call them back.” Becker, who represents her family’s development companies, earned her undergraduate degree from UNLV and her law degree from the Boyd School of Law. “I think it's refreshing to have a different person, a different perspective and someone willing to ask the questions in public and get answers for people that they deserve,” Becker said. “I look at this as an employee. I'm going to work for the people in my district.” Two other county commissioners up for re-election, Marilyn Kirkpatrick and William McCurdy, handily defeated their challengers. Incumbent Michael Naft won the District A race after extending his lead to nearly 3,000 votes by Friday morning over Republican Ryan Hamilton. Naft declared victory in asocial media postThursday afternoon. North Las Vegas City Council North Las Vegas City Councilwoman Ruth Garcia-Anderson retained her Ward 2 seat by 9 votes after the final ballots were cured Tuesday in a narrow victory over small-business owner Robert “Twixx” Taylor. Garcia-Anderson, appointed to the position by the city council in December 2022 after then-Councilwoman Pamela Goynes-Brown was elected mayor, led the race after early votes were counted on election night. However, the lead slipped away as Election Day and mail-in votes were tallied giving Taylor a slim 30-vote lead by Monday. According to the election department, Garcia-Anderson had 10,307 votes and Taylor received 10,298 votes of the 20,605 votes tabulated. Garcia-Anderson is the first Latina to serve on the city council. Taylor, the owner of Fade ‘Em All barber shops, had 38 more votes than Garcia-Anderson in the June primary. Henderson City Council Henderson City Councilman Dan Shaw, who was first appointed to the Ward 2 seat in 2017, lost his bid for a second four-year term. He was defeated by Monica Larson, a paralegal who has a doctorate in clinical psychology. She led by about 12 percentage points as of Wednesday evening. Shaw isfacing several lawsuitsfor making illegal payday loans through Green Arrow Solution, a tribal lender he controls with a business partner. Henderson ballot questions Henderson voters overwhelmingly rejected two small property tax increases. Both measures were trailing Wednesday, each with less than 40 percent of the vote. Question 1 would have added 6 cents in property tax per $100 of assessed value to issue as much as $27.5 million in bonds to build or modernize Henderson Fire Department facilities. Question 1 for the Henderson District Public Libraries would have increased property taxes by 2 cents per $100 assessed value for 30 years to help maintain existing libraries and build new locations.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/moms-for-liberty-linked-candidates-win-in-school-board-races,True,"Two candidates with ties to Moms for Liberty,a conservative groupthat has advocated for book bans and against policies that accommodate LGBTQ+ students,won their raceson the Clark County School Board. The growing conservative influence is part of significant turnover on a board where three trustees did not seek re-election. They’ll help shape the future of the Clark County School District (CCSD), which faces budgetary challenges and a superintendent search that is on hiatus until after the new trustees are sworn in. Here’s a look at election results for Clark and Washoe county school boards, as well as the Nevada State Board of Education and the Board of Regents, which governs higher education. Washoe County School Board District G Washoe County Trustee Diane Nicolet won in the District G race against tech businessman Perry Rosenstein. Nicolet beat Rosenstein by less than 2 percentage points, according to election results as of Nov. 13. Nicolet was elected to the board in 2020. She’s a longtime educator who has worked in early education through higher education. Nicolet was supported by current and former school board members, including Trustee Colleen Westlake. The at-large District G covers the western portion of Washoe County and includes Incline Village. Voters in geographical Districts A, C, D and E voted in the race. Clark County School Board District A Emily Stevens, vice president of business development for SCE Credit Union, has won the Clark County School Board’s District A race. Stevens, who is active on high school boards and a UNLV committee on financial literacy, defeated Karl Catarata, a charter school board member and Nevada state director for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group. Results as of Nov. 13 showed Stevens ahead of Catarata by about 16 percentage points. District A includes parts of Henderson as well as Boulder City, Searchlight and Laughlin. The seat is currently held by Trustee Lisa Guzman who didn’t run for re-election. District B Former Moms for Liberty Clark County chapter member Lydia Dominguez has won in the school board’s District B race. As of Nov. 13, Dominguez had a lead of about 12 percentage points over her opponent, Eileen Eady, a former teacher turned political consultant. District B includes parts of the northwestern Las Vegas Valley, Indian Springs, Bunkerville and the Moapa area. The seat was previously held by former Trustee Katie Williams, who resigned in September after an investigation found she was living out of state. Last week, the school board voted to appoint Nakia Jackson-Hale to the seat for the remainder of Williams’ term, which ends in early January. Dominguez, who serves on the district’s Attendance Zone Advisory Committee, had applied for the position prior to the election. District C Tameka Henry, the executive director of an anti-poverty nonprofit organization, won the District C race against Board President Evelyn Garcia Morales, the incumbent. The district includes parts of central Las Vegas and North Las Vegas. Results showed Henry with a lead of about 4 percentage points as of Nov. 13. Garcia Morales has faced multiple calls to resign, most recently for the district’s budget issues. District E Former local Moms for Liberty chapter member Lorena Biassotti (Cardenas) has won the Clark County School Board District E race against Kamilah Bywaters, a former CCSD teacher and leader of a group advocating for Black students. Results Nov. 13 showed Biassotti ahead by about 16 percentage points. District E, which includes western parts of the Las Vegas Valley and Summerlin, is represented by Trustee Lola Brooks, who isn’t running for re-election. State Board of Education District 1 Former New York City police officer turned educator Tricia Braxton has won the District 1 race for the Nevada State Board of Education against Tim Underwood, a former senior adviser of the local chapter of Moms for Liberty. Results Nov. 13 showed Braxton won by almost 20 percentage points. The District 1 seat was previously held by board member Tim Hughes, who ran this year for the District 4 seat because of redistricting. District 1 stretches from the southeastern part of Las Vegas to Henderson and Boulder City. Since the Moms for Liberty chapter’s launch last year, its members, including Underwood, have pushed for book bans and opposed a Clark County School District’s policy related to transgender students. District 2 Board Member Angela Orr, a Reno charter school principal, has won the District 2 race against Paul Davis, a professor who teaches courses on political science and international terrorism at Truckee Meadows Community College and UNLV. Orr was appointed to the state board by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo in 2023. Results Nov. 13 showed Orr winning by 6 percentage points. The geographically massive district includes Carson City, Churchill, Douglas, Elko, Eureka, Humboldt, Lander, Pershing, Storey, Washoe and White Pine counties, as well as parts of Lincoln and Lyon counties. District 3 Former CCSD trustee Danielle Ford won in the District 3 race againstRené Cantú, a current state board member. The incumbent, Felicia Ortiz, didn’t run for re-election. Results as of Nov. 13 show Ford winning by about 3 percentage points. Cantú ran for a different seat on the board because of redistricting. He’s the founding executive director of Jobs for Nevada's Graduates, a nonprofit organization established in 2014 that helps students meet graduation and career goals. Ford is a former trustee turned podcast host. She’s a Nevada native, former CCSD student and has two adult children who went through CCSD schools. Ford served on the Clark County School Board from 2019 to 2023, and lost her bid for re-election in 2022 against former Assemblywoman Irene Bustamante Adams. District 3 encompasses parts of Las Vegas and Henderson. Board of Regents District 1 Carlos Fernandez, the executive director of the American Institute of Architects, and a former lobbyist for the Las Vegas Chamber, has won the race for District 1. He defeated Matthew Bowen, a sales professional with experience as an insurance agent and financial planning, according to his LinkedIn profile. Results as of Nov. 13 show Fernandez beating Bowen by about 16 percentage points. The seat is currently held by Regent Laura Perkins. Perkins opted not to seek re-election and ran for state Senate District 4, but lost in a primary. District 1encompasses the northeastern Las Vegas Valley. District 4 Aaron Bautista, a special education teacher at Mater Academy Mountain Vista, a K-8 charter school in east Las Vegas, won the District 4 race against Tonia Holmes-Sutton, the chair of the State Public Charter School Authority’s board. Results as of Nov. 13 show Bautista won by about 16 percentage points. Bautista has also worked at Legacy Traditional Schools and CCSD. He serves on the city of Las Vegas’ Neighborhood Partners Fund Board and Our Future East Las Vegas Advisory Board. Holmes-Sutton previously served on the State Board of Education in a governor-appointed position and is a former CCSD teacher, former executive director of Teach Plus Nevada and a national board certified teacher.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-wins-reelection-fending-off-brown-in-nevadas-tight-us-senate-race,True,"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) has won Nevada’s U.S. Senate race, fending off a challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown in a contest closer than polls had projected to represent the Silver State for a second term. Like several of her Senate Democratic colleagues running in tight races, Rosen was able to win re-election despite former President Donald Trump winning the state at the top of the ticket. With her win, Democrats have retained a critical swing-state seat. By flipping seats in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, Republicans have now taken control of the upper chamber. Races in Arizona and Pennsylvania, two seats held by Democrats, have yet to be called. (Clickherefor updated race results.) The Nevada Independentis able to call the race for Rosen — who currently leads by more than 12,000 votes — because of the makeup of outstanding ballots. Nye County, a reliably red rural area, is yet to post about 10,000 mail ballots, which will improve Brown’s totals. But with more than 30,000 mail ballots in Washoe County and mail that arrived on Election Day evening or after Election Day still to come, the bulk of the remaining ballots are mail from Clark and Washoe counties, which Rosen has won by significant margins. Rosen’s victory will be far narrower than many polls projected, but is a significant feat given that Trump — who currently leads in the state by close to 4 percentage points — won Nevada. The junior senator is running close to 5 percentage points ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris. The discrepancy was most stark when looking at raw vote totals. As of Thursday morning, with more than 1.35 million votes cast in the Senate race, Rosen lagged Harris by about 3,000 votes, while Brown received nearly 60,000 fewer votes than Trump. The data suggests that while Rosen held Harris voters, a statistically significant portion of Trump voters left the rest of their ballot blank or voted for someone other than Brown in the Senate race. In Clark County — the site of the Democratic collapse in the presidential race — Rosen leads by nearly 7 percentage points, while Harris’ advantage is just over 2 points. The third-party vote was also much larger in the Senate race. When combining votes for the two third-party candidates in each race and Nevada’s “none of the above” option, others received nearly 6 percent of the vote in the Senate race, while garnering just about 2 percent in the presidential race. And in Washoe County, where Brown lives, evidence of ticket-splitting emerged. Rosen received more raw votes than Harris there — currently, Trump leads by about 1.5 percentage points while Rosen is winning by about 3.5 percentage points. (Both Democrats’ margins will likely increase once more Washoe mail ballots are tabulated.) Rosen officially declared victory on Friday night, and Brown conceded Saturday morning. Rosen, who raised significantly more money than Brown, was able to create an advantage early by going up on television with ads in April, while Brown was still mired in a crowded primary. In total — about $120 was spent per voter in the Nevada Senate race. A former computer programmer and synagogue president from Henderson, Rosen first entered politics in 2016 when she flipped a House seat. In 2018, she ran for U.S. Senate, defeating incumbent Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) to once again flip a critical seat. Throughout her political career, the low-key senator, relatively moderate without being a nuisance to leadership and known for her commitment tobipartisanship, ran on a platform of protecting abortion rights, lowering costs and defining herself as a Nevada-first senator. And she often touted her Nevada roots — Rosen has spent nearly 50 years in the state to Brown’s six. Brown, her opponent, attacked Rosen throughout the campaign as a “rubber stamp” for President Joe Biden’s agenda, pointing out how frequently she votes with the president’s stated position. But Rosen hit him early on a winning theme in the state — abortion rights. Brown, who had previously run for the Legislature in Texas in 2014 and has been dogged by past comments he made supporting an abortion ban, repeatedly said that he would not vote for a national abortion ban. But in a state where abortion is legal up to 24 weeks and where abortion rights are supported by a significant majority of the voters — the passage of a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s Constitution reiterated that attitude this year — Rosen’s message was better-funded and evidently well-received. U.S. Senate races in the purple state of Nevada have become increasingly expensive, and 2024 was no exception. Close to $165 million was spent on the race, per AdImpact. Democrats had the advantage, spending $94.3 million to Republicans’ $70.3 million. The discrepancy is more stark when looking at direct spending between Rosen and Brown, who can book ad time at a lower rate offered to candidates. Rosen’s campaign outspent Brown’s by more than $21 million in solo expenditures. This story was updated at 9 a.m. on 11/9/24 to add that Rosen had declared victory and Brown had conceded the race.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevadans-reject-open-primary-ranked-choice-voting-ballot-measure,True,"Nevada voters have rejected the most significant proposed change to the state’s election system since mail-in ballots were implemented in 2020. Question 3, which proposed to implement open primaries and ranked-choice voting, was behind by a substantial margin after the release of results from early voting and mail ballots received before Election Day. (Click hereto see up-to-date results.) It’s a blow for proponents who had looked to the concept as a way to bolster centrism in politics and give a voice to a growing number of nonpartisans who can’t vote in marquee primary contests. The measure’s double-digit defeat comes after it passed in the Silver State by nearly 6 percentage points in 2022. That year, it succeeded despite vehement opposition from Nevada’s top Democrats and Republicans, who argued it was confusing and could lead to ballot errors, thus disenfranchising voters. The measure, like other proposed constitutional amendments, needed to pass in two consecutive elections to take effect. One major difference between the two elections is that opponents spent very little money in 2022 pushing back on the measure, but the opposition political action committee, Protect Your Vote Nevada, spent more than $2 million this year, according toits most recent campaign finance report.It was still far outspent by the supporting PAC, Vote Yes on 3, which poured more than$12 millionintothis cycle’s efforts. The group opposing Question 3 has primarily been funded by the Nevada Alliance, a left-leaning group that does not have to disclose its donors (commonly referred to as a “dark money” group) but has donated millions to Democratic initiatives in Nevada. It’s an ironic funding source for the group, given that it hasreleased adscondemning Question 3 for being funded by “out of state special interests.” Meanwhile, almost all the money supporting the effort in 2022 came fromout-of-state donors, led by Katherine Gehl, a Chicago-based businesswoman who pioneered the concept of Final-Five Voting, the model for Nevada’s Question 3. This year, the effort was largely supported with donations byArticle IV, a Virginia-based nonpartisan group focused on improving democracy, andUnite America, a philanthropic fund dedicated to election reform. Battle Born Progress Executive Director Shelbie Swartz said Tuesday’s results signal that Nevada voters do not appreciate out-of-state billionaires meddling in elections. “From the start, Question 3 proposed electoral changes that were confusing, costly and did little to address the problems its proponents said it would,” Swartz said. “We’re glad voters saw through the spin and rejected Question 3.” The progressive organization opposed Question 3 since it was first proposed. Sondra Cosgrove, a professor at the College of Southern Nevada who has advocated for the measure as a volunteer, said Democrats indicated they would support a measure that was limited to open primaries and didn’t lump it in with ranked-choice voting, and she wants to hold them to that promise. She noted that initiatives for ranked-choice open primary votingfailed nationwidethis year and attributed it to a national-level consultant group behind the campaigns that focused on broader messaging and didn’t engage voters at an individual level. The consultants also misled voters by not talking about the ranked-choice element of the ballot measure, she said. Cosgrove, who has led various civic engagement groups, said grassroots organizers focused on individual outreach, conversations about ranked-choice voting and voter information guides, but didn’t have broader funding to support their efforts. “I think that way would have been successful if we had had funding to support it,” she said. “It wasn’t the idea that failed; it was the strategy that failed.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-win-for-lombardo-dems-appear-unlikely-to-win-veto-proof-supermajority-in-legislature,True,"Democrats will not gain the coveted two-thirds supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature that would allow them to override Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo's vetoes. As of Nov. 12, Republicans prevented supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature after winning 15 seats in the 42-member Assembly and eight seats in the 21-member state Senate. Though Republicans gained one seat in the state Assembly and kept the number of seats they held in the Senate, Democrats maintained majorities in both chambers, leaving the executive branch under Republican control and the legislative branch in the hands of Democrats. Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) and Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) successfully fended off challenges from Republican opponents. Cannizzaro and Yeager’s races were too close to call on election night, but as more ballots were tabulated, the two widened their leads. Sen. Dallas Harris (D-Las Vegas) was the only incumbent running for re-election to lose her seat. With the majority unable to override his vetoes, Lombardo has touted himself as a one-man roadblock to the Democratic majority’s policy priorities. In 2023, he set a record for the most vetoes issued in a single legislative session,rejecting 75 of the 611 billspassed by the Legislature. Among the bills Lombardo scuttled that Democrats have highlighted this election cycle are a raft of housing bills that would have added new tenant protections and overhauled the state’s summary eviction procedures, measures to lower the cost of prescription drugs and a measure that would have continued funding universal free school breakfasts and lunches at K-12 schools. Democrats have already announced they plan to bring back versions of the vetoed bills in 2025. Outside of the2014 “red-wave” electionand subsequent legislative session, Democrats have maintained control of both houses of the Legislature since 2009, fueled by the “Reid Machine”builtby longtime U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). The party further bolstered its structuraladvantagesin congressional and legislative races in 2021 through control of the redistricting process, which saw Democratsredraw state maps. Republicans have had more luck winning the governor’s seat, however, and can play a formidable defense against Democratic legislative majorities from that perch. Lombardo and his allies have taken anactive rolein picking and boosting candidates — mostly moderate Republicans — who have campaigned on the goal of preventing one-party rule in the Legislature. The result has been a competitive cycle, with Democrats and Republicans neck and neck in fundraising and cash on hand. Eleven seats in the 21-member Senate were not up for election this cycle, leaving 52 legislative races that determined Lombardo’s veto power. Nine of the seats up for election in the Legislature (seven in the Assembly and two in the Senate) were already decided because there was no challenger from an opposing party; four of the Assembly seats and one Senate seat that are already decided will be held by Republicans. Below, we break down the status of supermajorities in each chamber of the Legislature and the consequential legislative races we watched this election cycle. STATE SENATE Senate District 5- Sen. Carrie Buck (R-Henderson) defeated Jennifer Atlas (D) by a wide margin In the swing district covering portions of Henderson and Paradise, Buck defeated Atlas.

Senate District 15- Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno) won her race against Mike Ginsburg (R) Taylor had a wide lead over Ginsburg in the district covering southwestern Washoe County, which used to favor Republicans but shifted to have a significant Democratic voter registration advantage under the state’s 2021 redistricting process. The seat is open after Sen. Heidi Seevers O'Gara (formerly Seevers Gansert) (R-Reno)announced last yearthat she would not run for re-election. ASSEMBLY Assembly District 4- Lisa Cole (R) prevailed in her race against Ryan Hampton (D) In the race for this open seat in northwest Las Vegas, currently held by a Republican, Cole defeated Hampton. The seat is open after Assemblyman Richard McArthur, a Republican, launched an unsuccessful bid for state Senate. The seat has been Republican-held since 2020, but it is no stranger to tight races and has narrow voter registration margins between the two major parties. Assembly District 5 — Assemblywoman Brittney Miller (D-Las Vegas) won her race against Kelly Quinn (R) Miller won in this Southern Nevada district. Assembly District 9 - Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) triumphed in a race against Erica Neely (R) Yeager eked out a victory in the reliably blue district in Southern Nevada.

Assembly District 34 - Hanadi Nadeem (D) won her contest against Brandon Davis (R) Nadeem has defeated Davis in the Summerlin-area Assembly District 34. Assemblywoman Shannon Bilbray-Axelrod (D-Las Vegas) vacated the seat to run for Clark County Commission this year. Bilbray-Axelrod lost to attorney April Becker, who will become the first Republican in 20 years to be elected to the Clark County Commission. Nadeem will be the first Muslim woman elected to the Legislature. Assembly District 35 - Rebecca Edgeworth (R) was the victor in her race against Sharifa Wahab (D) Edgeworth won this Southern Nevada race. The seat isbeing vacatedby Assemblywoman Michelle Gorelow (D-Las Vegas).

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-voters-reject-board-of-regents-question-approve-diaper-tax-exemption,True,"Question 1 Voters rejected a measure to remove the constitutional status of the elected Board of Regents, which oversees higher education in Nevada, and grant the Legislature the authority to “review, reform and improve the programs and operations” of the state’s public universities. It comes after voters narrowly rejected a similar effort to remove the constitutional status of the elected Board of Regents in 2020. Question 1 would have removed all references to the Board of Regents from the Nevada Constitution, but would not have affected other laws regarding the Board of Regents, such as its ability to govern and manage the Nevada System of Higher Education or the processes for electing board members. Nevada is among 28 states with a single administrative board overseeing all higher education institutions within its borders, and is the only one among those that elects all members of that board through a general election. Supporters of the measure — which easily passed in the 2021 and 2023 legislative sessions landing it on the 2024 ballot — said the measure would have helped provide more oversight for the Board of Regents. Last year, when speaking in favor of the measure, Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas) said the Board of Regents has “virtually unparalleled power within state government to control and manage higher education spending without the same level of legislative oversight typically applied to other executive branch agencies.” The measure was opposed by the members of the Board of Regents, who said it would not adequately address problems in Nevada’s higher education system. In recent years, the Board of Regents has been accused of misrepresenting reports to the Legislature and allowing the misuse of studenttuition dollars. Question 2 Voters approved Question 2, which would remove the terms “insane,” “deaf” and “dumb” from the Nevada Constitution and broaden the language so it applies to a wider range of people with disabilities. Now that it passed,the term“insane” will be replaced with “persons with significant mental illness”; “blind” to “persons who are blind or visually impaired”; and “deaf and dumb” to “persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.” Question 2 received little pushback from legislators, and received broad support from disability advocacy groups that said the measure would help advance the rights of people with disabilities. Question 4 Voters approved Question 4, a measure to remove language from the state Constitution that allows for slavery or indentured servitude as criminal punishment. Nevada joins eight other states that have passed similar ballot measures. The amended text will change the Constitution’s original language that prohibited involuntary servitude except “in the punishment for crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted” to read “neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever be tolerated in this State.” Other states’ constitutions have similar language, dubbed the “penal exception” to the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude in the United States except as punishment for a crime. In the 19th century, Southern states took advantage of this loophole to allow authorities to incarcerate Black people for petty crimes, such as vagrancy, and force them to work. Civil rights groups, such as the Las Vegas NAACP, said that it will help promote the rights of Black Americans and other people of color within Nevada. Assemblyman Howard Watts (D-Las Vegas) said during a legislative hearing last year that the passage of the measure would ensure that nobody will ever have to endure state-sanctioned slavery again, opening a “new chapter” in Nevada history. “We have seen over the last year that the scars of slavery and racism still cause pain throughout this state and our country,” Watts said. “Changing this language is important to help us all heal and demonstrate our commitment to the concept of justice for all.” Since 2018, several states and members of Congress have pushed to remove penal exception constitutional language, including several measures that were approved by voters in Colorado, Nebraska, Utah, Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont. Despite the change in language, prison work programs — some of which pay as little as 25 cents per hour — will continue. Question 5 Voters passed Question 5, a measure to exempt Nevada’s sales tax on adult and child diapers, adding it to a list of other items that are exempt from the tax such as food and feminine hygiene products. More specifically, the ballot measure will amend the state’s 1955 sales and use tax, which established sales tax on revenue from personal property, and which has a slew of exemptions, many obtained through recent ballot initiatives. Now that itpassed,Nevada will join 19 states — ranging from Texas to California — in exempting diapers from the sales tax. The exemption would begin in 2025 and last through the end of 2050. Question 5 has been backed by legislators and a variety of local organizations, including the nonprofit diaper bank Baby’s Bounty and Battle Born Progress, a progressive organization. Last year, in a letter to the lawmakers, Baby Bounty’s Executive Director Kelly Maxwell called diapers a “fundamental need” for a child’s health and argued that the measure would help secure access for at-need families.The state estimates that it will lose about $400 million in tax revenue over 25 years, according to the secretary of state’sballot question summary.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-still-too-close-to-call-as-trump-closes-in-on-presidency,True,"Former President Donald Trump has won Nevada’s six electoral votes, becoming the first Republican to win the state in two decades and riding a wave of discontent over the economy and an embrace of voting methods that Nevada Republicans have previously eschewed. Nevada, with its six electoral votes, proved not to be a decider — Trump appears to have swept the seven swing states, with races called for him in all but Michigan and Arizona, where he currently leads. Despite losing his prior two attempts in 2016 and 2020 — by margins of about 2.5 percent both times — Trump, bolstered by strong turnout among registered Republicans and the erosion of Democrats’ traditional advantage in populous Clark County, finally won the Silver State on his third try. (Clickhereto see full results.) The race against Vice President Kamala Harris was seen as a dead heat in the Silver State, and while the final margin is yet to be decided, Trump appears to have won relatively comfortably. While Harris leads in Clark County, Trump’s performance in the populous vote center — he is currently behind by less than 1 percent — appears to be Republicans’ strongest in recent memory. Republicans had been optimistic about their chances in the past couple of weeks, buoyed by strong early voting and mail voting turnout after the party finally embraced the legal voting methods after years of casting doubt on their reliability. Trump’s victory was also bolstered by high turnout in Nevada’s 15 rural counties, which are heavily Republican and offset Harris’ marginal lead in Clark County. And he leads in Washoe County — typically a bellwether — by about 2.5 percent points. By comparison, Biden won the county in 2020 by 4.5 percent. Though counting in the state still continues, Trump’s margin of victory stands at close to 5 percent. Even though there are outstanding mail votes in Clark County, Harris will not be able to make up the deficit, given the size of Trump’s lead. After the initial ballot dump of just over 1 million votes, the race was too close to call, with Trump leading by 2.7 percentage points. But as more votes trickled in from rural counties — where Trump dominated — and new results from Clark and Washoe came in, it became clear that Harris was not seeing the margins in the state’s urban areas that she would need to overcome Trump’s lead. Instead, they grew. The Trump victory represents an exciting moment for Nevada Republicans. Nevada GOP chair Michael McDonald, who has supported Trump through all three of his presidential runs and even attempted to overturn the 2020 election on his behalf, congratulated the former president. “It has been an honor of my life to be by your side since 2015,” McDonaldwroteon X. “This has been one hell of a ride.” Throughout the cycle, Trump made frequent appearances to Nevada, with most of his rallies featuring his freewheeling style of hurling insults, doubling down on anti-immigrant rhetoric and mixing anecdotes with vague policy proposals, such as slashing energy bills in half within a year or immediately ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. However, at aLas Vegas rallyin June, he made a notable pledge to end taxes on tipped wages, an effort to win over the state’s thousands of hospitality workers, and Harrisfollowed suitmonths later. Despite the Harris campaign’s significant financial advantage — Democrats outspent Republicans in the presidential race in Nevada by a more than 2-to-1 margin — Trump campaign officials were confident that the fundamentals of the race favored them. Nevada has persistently had the highest unemployment rate in the country throughout Biden’s term, a trend ofrisinghousing costs exacerbated by the pandemic and continual voter frustration over inflation. The Trump campaign also believed that his message would resonate more with voters of color — particularly Latino men — in the majority-minority state than it had in elections past. Though Democrats have traditionally benefited from a superior ground game — and this cycle was no exception, with the mighty Culinary Workers Union Local 226 knocking over 900,000 doors — Nevada Republicans had been increasingly encouraged by election results since 2020. Nevada was the only state where Democratic President Joe Biden won but did not improve on 2016 candidate Hillary Clinton’s margins; the percentage of college-educated voters — among Democrats’ best-performing demographic groups — is lower in Nevada than any other swing state. And with a Trump sweep of the swing states likely, it appears that strong Democratic ground games — in Nevada and elsewhere — were not the salve that Democrats were hoping it would be. And the Trump campaign and state surrogates fully embraced early voting, encouraging Republicans to “bank [their votes]” early, which helped the party build a significant lead as a majority of votes poured in in the pre-Election Day period. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s 2022 victory, despite the low turnout, provided a pathway for Republican statewide wins — keep the Democratic margin of victory in populous Clark County low, keep Washoe County competitive if not win it outright and run up the score in the red rural areas. Trump replicated that formula — and appears to have overperformed Lombardo’s 1.5 percent victory, a function of much higher turnout and improvement in Clark County. Trump’s victory was propelled by a surge in the share of voters who are registered as Republicans since his defeat by about 33,000 votes four years ago. At the time, Democrats had a roughly 5 percentage point registration advantage that has since fallen to less than a percentage point. A plurality of the 2024 electorate is now registered as nonpartisan, a result of the state’s implementation of automatic voter registration in 2020, with the default option being nonpartisan. While it is unclear exactly how registered nonpartisans split their votes, Democrats’ confidence that the nonpartisan population leaned Democratic appears to have been unfounded. Given registered Republicans’ turnout advantage in the pre-Election Day voting period, Harris would have needed to win nonpartisans to be competitive in the state. With more than 1.26 million votes in and Trump leading by nearly 5 percent, it’s clear that independents did not break for Harris by any meaningful margin. Overall, Nevada proved a signifier of Trump’s performance around the country. His improvements relative to 2020 were not concentrated in any one region, be it the Southwest or swing states as a whole. He’s on track to win the popular vote as well — a feat that, like winning Nevada, no Republican had done since 2004. — Gabby Birenbaum and Eric Neugeboren, 8:15 a.m. 11/6/2024 Nevada still too close to call as Trump closes in on presidency Nevadans are going to bed on election night without knowing which presidential candidate won the state’s six electoral votes — though the state’s eventual result will not decide the presidency. The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is too close to call as of midnight on Election Day, with nearly 1.1 million votes reported. Currently, Trump holds a lead of 5 percentage points, with numerous Election Day votes and late-arriving mail ballots, including those dropped off today, yet to be tabulated. (Clickhereto see full results.) Even though several news outlets declared Trump the winner of the presidency Tuesday evening, the results of Nevada’s presidential contest will determine whether he will sweep all seven battleground states, as he is expected to carry the remaining six. When Trump won in 2016, he carried all of this year’s battlegrounds, save for Nevada. Meanwhile, Republicans have gained control of the U.S. Senate, but Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) is locked in a tight battle against Republican Sam Brown, who is underperforming Trump so far, particularly in Washoe County. That means the only undecided federal chamber is the U.S. House, where two of the three Democrat-held seats in Nevada remain too close to call, and Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) prevailed handily in the 4th District, which includes parts of Clark County and rural Nevada. Since Harris first entered the race in July, polling between the two has remained neck and neck, with neither candidate able to establish a lead large enough to predict the winner. Both candidates invested significant time and resources into the state. Trump changed the policy terrain in Las Vegas in June when hepledgedto end taxation on tips; Harrisfollowedwith her own proposal to end taxes on tips and raise the minimum wage in Las Vegas in August. Trump personally appeared at roundtables and rallies to shore up support amongLatino AmericansandAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders, whileHarrisand her running mate, Minnesota Gov.Tim Walz, made several visits to the state, and big-name surrogates including former presidentsBarack Obamaand Bill Clinton were on hand during early voting to underscore its importance. Both candidates had dueling stops Oct. 31 in Las Vegas and Reno, making their closing arguments to Nevada voters. Voters were inundated with ads from each campaign on every medium; the Harris campaign evenlit upthe Sphere. Tuesday night’s results reinforce just how close the race is — in Nevada, at least. Turnout currently stands at about 1.1 million. In 2020, Nevada saw record turnout of more than 1.4 million votes. With figures about mail ballots turned in on Election Day unavailable, turnout for this year is difficult to predict. With the race too close to call, the winner will likely be decided based on mail ballots that trickle in after Election Day. Republicans unsuccessfully sued to block the counting of thesemail ballots, which can be received until Saturday, as well asnon-postmarkedmail ballots that come in by 5 p.m. Friday. In 2022, about 6 percent of Clark County and 3 percent of Washoe County votes were received after Election Day, though it is unclear how many votes are outstanding this year given that presidential elections tend to have much higher turnout. Trump is attempting to be the first Republican to win a presidential race in Nevada since George W. Bush in 2004. Since then, Democrats have been able to win through building a significant enough firewall in Clark County, where 70 percent of voters live, to counteract Republican vote totals in swingy Washoe County and the ruby-red rural counties. That formula has been threatened this cycle by a diminishing voter registration advantage. On Election Day 2020, Democrats had a voter registration advantage of about 5 percentage points; in 2024, it was down to 1 percent. In Clark County, which President Joe Biden won by 9 percentage points, Democrats’ voter registration edge by Election Day was down to less than 7 percentage points. But rather than representing Republican gains, the biggest change in voter registration dynamics has been an explosion in nonpartisan registration — bolstered by the state’s 2020implementationof automatic voter registration. Trump’s path to victory in the state is to ensure, as has occurred in past cycles, that Republicans turn out at higher rates than Democrats, while Harris needs to win independent voters by a significant enough margin to overcome the weakening of the Clark County Democratic firewall. In the roughly 1 million votes included in the initial batch of results, Trump maintained a roughly 4 percentage point advantage over Harris — similar to the turnout lead held by registered Republicans over registered Democrats across those same votes. It indicates that nonpartisans have, so far, split evenly among the two candidates. In trying to win nonpartisan voters, the Harris campaign relied on Democrats’ traditional organizing strength in Nevada — the Reid Machine mix of union canvassers, state party officials, campaign organizers and interest groups whose impressive ground game has delivered the state to Democrats in the past. To that effect, the mighty Culinary Workers’ Union Local 226 has knocked more than 900,000 doors this cycle. Trump, meanwhile, has banked on economic dissatisfaction in a state that has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, and gains among voters of color — in particular, Latino men. Both campaigns have spent enormous sums of money to get their message out to voters — about $122 million in total. Democrats have significantly outspent Republicans in the presidential race, between the Harris campaign itself and allied outside groups. Harris-aligned spending has totaled about $85 million, while Trump and his affiliates have thrown in nearly $36 million. While the election is still too close to call in Nevada, the state did not end up mattering to either candidate’s path to 270 votes. In the U.S. Senate, however, it will determine the size of the Republican majority. Having flipped Democratic seats in Ohio and West Virginia, Republicans will now have control of the upper chamber. Races in five swing states — including Nevada — are still too close to call. Republican Sam Brown has a lead of less than half a percentage point — meaning Rosen is outrunning Harris. — Gabby Birenbaum and Eric Neugeboren, 11:55 p.m. 11/5/2024",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevadans-vote-to-enshrine-abortion-rights-in-constitution-but-it-needs-approval-in-2026,True,"Nevadans have overwhelmingly voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s Constitution, where they would be harder to undo, as they seek to further shore up reproductive rights since the fall ofRoe v. Wadetwo years ago. The approval of Question 6, which asked voters whether the Nevada Constitution should include a fundamental right to abortion, means that the Constitution will be amended if a majority of voters also approve it in 2026. The question would not change abortion access in the state, but it would make it harder for existing protections — allowing abortion up through 24 weeks into a pregnancy — to be overturned. The current law can be overturned by a one-time majority vote of the people, but if the protections are enshrined in the state Constitution, it would take two majority votes for a change to occur. The question’s success is a resounding victory for reproductive rights advocates, who have pursued abortion-related ballot questions in a slew of states since the overturning ofRoemeant that abortion rights would be decided on a state-by-state basis. Voters innine other statesvoted Tuesday on ballot questions aimed at bolstering abortion access. The initiative in Nevada kicked off last September when a group called Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom filed a broader petition that sought to establish a constitutional right to “reproductive freedom,” which also would have protected the right procedures such as vasectomies as well as infertility and prenatal care. However, a Carson City judgestruck downthe petition in November after a lawsuit argued the question was too broad and carried an unfunded mandate, preventing supporters from gathering signatures. Although the Nevada Supreme Courtreversedthis decision months later, Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom pivoted to a narrower question that only focused on protecting the right to an abortion. This effort also faced a legal challenge, but the question received approval from a Carson City judge and the Nevada Supreme Court. The passage of the question opens the possibility of two abortion-related ballot questions appearing on the 2026 ballot. In the 2023 legislative session, Democratic lawmakers passed a constitutional amendment that mirrors the broader ballot question that advocates pushed to appear on this year’s ballot. If the Legislature passes the amendment during next year’s session, it will also appear on the 2026 ballot. The measureofficially qualifiedfor the November ballot after election officials verified more than 127,000 signatures gathered by petition supporters, well more than the roughly 102,000 needed to qualify for the ballot. Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom raised more than $11 million through the end of September, much of which came from so-called “dark money” groups, which are not required to disclose their donors under federal tax law. The group has spent more than $7 million in television ads this cycle, according to ad-tracking firmAdImpact. The left-leaning dark money groups that contributed to the effort include the Advocacy Action Fund ($2 million), Nevada Alliance ($1 million), Open Society Action Fund ($1 million) and the Tides Foundation ($837,000). Many of these groups have given money to support abortion-related ballot questions, which are seen as a potential way to drive up Democratic turnout, particularly in states where abortion is not already protected. The effort also received $1.15 million from Think Big America, a nonprofit tied to Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL), who is widely considered a future presidential candidate. Director Steven Spielberg also donated $50,000 to Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom. Opponents have argued that the petition is unnecessary and misleads voters because abortion is already legal in the state. Guardians of the Young, a PAC opposing the ballot initiative, was registered in August but has not reported any money raised.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/election-results-live-blog,True,"Welcome toThe Nevada Independent’selection results live blog! During election night and the rest of the week,The Indywill be using this page to track results and declare winners in Nevada’s presidential and congressional races, and the key contests in the state Legislature. We’ll also be bringing you results for important ballot questions. For details on the ballot counting timeline, read ourexplainer here. — Rosen wins Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) defeated challenger Sam Brown, winning a second term to represent Nevada in the U.S. Senate. Rosen, a former computer programmer and synagogue president, first entered politics in 2016, winning a House seat in Nevada’s swingy 3rd District. From there, she defeated then-Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in 2018. With her latest victory, she remains unbeaten in her political career. While her fellow Democrat Kamala Harris lost at the top of the ticket, Rosen was able to outrun Harris, while Brown’s raw vote total lagged significantly behind Trump’s. Her victory is also crucial for the balance of the Senate. By holding her seat, Democrats, who held 51 seats for the past two years, will have at least 46 seats in the next Congress. Two races remain uncalled, but Republicans will have control of the upper chamber. — Gabby Birenbaum, 9:40 a.m.11/7/2024 Susie Lee and Dina Titus win, keeping Las Vegas in Democratic hands in the House Susie Lee wins In her perpetually competitive district, Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) has hung on to win a fourth term to the U.S. House. Lee has a history of winning narrow races in District 3, which includes southern Clark County and the southern and western parts of the Las Vegas Valley. Her 2024 margin of victory appears to be narrow, as it was in her last two races, where she won by fewer than 5 percentage points. The 3rd Congressional District has a history of swinging between parties, so Lee’s victory will make her the district’s longest-tenured representative, if she finishes out her term. While control of the House is not yet decided, with several districts in California still processing ballots, holding onto Lee’s seat was a necessity for Democrats to have a chance at reclaiming the speaker’s gavel. An active member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and the center-left New Democrat Coalition, Lee has been building seniority — and entering leadership roles — in those key factions throughout her time in Congress. Titus wins Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) has been elected to an eighth term in the U.S. House of Representatives after defeating Republican challenger Mark Robertson. Titus previously beat Robertson in 2022, even though national Republican groups poured money into the race that cycle. This time, Republicans passed on spending in Nevada. Titus represents Congressional District 1, which encompasses the Las Vegas Strip and the southeastern parts of Clark County, including most of Henderson and Boulder City. A senior member of the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, Titus is poised to chair a subcommittee if Democrats flip the House. Several districts in California are still tabulating results, meaning voters still do not know which party will control the lower chamber. If she finishes out her term, Titus will have the second longest House tenure in Nevada history. — Gabby Birenbaum, 8 a.m.11/7/2024 This story was updated at 1:30 p.m. on 11/8/24 to reflect that Titus' eight terms would be the second-longest tenure in Nevada history, rather than the longest. Berkley wins Las Vegas mayor race; Becker to take commission seat Former Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV) will be the next Las Vegas mayor in a major comeback for the longtime politician. Las Vegas City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman, who is in the middle of her first full term representing the city’s Ward 2, trailed by more than 5 percentage points by Wednesday. She will continue to serve on the council. Berkley, 73, who served 14 years as a Democratic congresswoman representing a district that included a large portion of the City of Las Vegas, will become the first mayor in 25 years not named Goodman when inaugurated in January. Current MayorCarolyn Goodmanwas term-limited. She succeeded her husband, mob lawyer Oscar Goodman, who began the family’s hold on the office in 1999 and took a splashy approach to the leadership role, often appearing with showgirls and a martini in hand. Seaman, 66, is a former one-term Republican assemblywoman who was elected to the city council during a special election in 2019 to finish the term of a councilman who resigned. In another Southern Nevada local government campaign, attorney April Becker will become the first Republican in 20 years to be elected to the Clark County Commission. Becker leads Assemblywoman Shannon Bilbray-Axelrod (D-Las Vegas) by 7 percentage points in the race to represent District C. The seat is being vacated by Democrat Ross Miller, who didn’t seek re-election. Becker is an attorney who previously lost two close races — one for the Nevada Senate seat held by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) and another for Congress against Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV). Bilbary-Axelrod is a four-term state assemblywoman first elected in 2016. Two other county commissioners up for re-election, Marilyn Kirkpatrick and William McCurdy, handily defeated their challengers. The District A race remains too close to call. Incumbent Michael Naft has a lead of less than 1 percent over Republican Ryan Hamilton. — Howard Stutz, 8:53 a.m. 11/6/2024 Trump wins Nevada Former President Donald Trump has won Nevada, becoming the first Republican to win the state since George W. Bush in 2004. Trump had lost the Silver State in his two previous attempts, each by a margin of about 2.5 percentage points. But bolstered by strong Republican turnout, improvements in populous Clark County and a landslide in rural areas, the third time proved a charm for the former president. With Nevada in the win column, Trump is now projected to sweep all seven battleground states. Clickhereto read our full recap of the result. — Eric Neugeboren, 8:15 a.m.,11/6/2024 Races for president, Senate, 2 House races too close to call After the initial 1 million Nevada results were released in the 10 o’clock hour on Tuesday evening, races for key federal races were too close to call. (See below for the House races wehavecalled). As of about 11 p.m., former President Donald Trump had a lead of more than 4 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris. He trailed by about 13,000 votes in Clark County, while swingy Washoe County was a dead heat and the deep-red rural counties gave Trump an initial lead. (For the most up-to-date results,click here.) The initial batch of results included in-person early votes and mail ballots received before Election Day. Registered Republicans had a roughly 4 percentage point turnout advantage over registered Democrats, indicating that nonpartisans — who make up a sizable portion of the electorate — were splitting pretty evenly among the presidential candidates. There are many outstanding mail and in-person Election Day ballots in Clark County, which should help Democrats because of their registration advantage there. In the U.S. Senate race, Republican Sam Brown held a miniscule advantage over Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), though he was trailing in bellwether Washoe County. By both percent and raw vote totals, he is underperforming Trump across the state. In the House, Congressional District 3 — as is custom — is the closest race: Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) has a lead of about 1.5 percentage points over Republican challenger Drew Johnson. While the race is still too close to call, mail ballots dropped off on Election Day in Clark County — which are expected to break toward Democrats — will not be tabulated until tomorrow. In Congressional District 1, meanwhile, Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) has opened up a 5.5 percentage point lead over Republican Mark Robertson. Titus, who has held this seat since 2012, beat Robertson in 2022 by a margin of 5.6 percentage points. Horsford wins Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) has won a fourth consecutive term to represent Congressional District 4 — and his fifth term overall. Horsford, who was the 4th District’s first representative when it was created ahead of the 2012 election and then lost his seat in the 2014 red wave, made a political comeback in 2018 and has held the seat ever since. Having served as the chairman of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus for the past two years, he grew his national profile, amplifying his fundraising power and making Republicans hesitant to spend any money on the race. That contributed to his significant financial advantage over his opponent, former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, in the district, which encompasses Democrat-heavy North Las Vegas and northern Clark County, as well as much of rural central Nevada. In the general election, Horsford and allied Democratic groups outspent Lee — who received virtually no outside advertising support — by $4.5 million on the airwaves, per ad tracking firm AdImpact. Horsford was recently reappointed to the powerful Ways & Means Committee, the House panel that writes tax policy and will be the critical battlefield for debates over the expiring Trump tax cuts. If Democrats win the House, his position on the committee is safe — if they lose, the margins will determine whether he keeps his perch or not, though retirements will likely make his position safe barring large Republican pickups. Control of the House has yet to be determined, with several districts still tabulating votes.Question 3 fails Nevada voters have rejected the most significant proposed change to the state’s election system since mail-in ballots were implemented in 2020. After the release of results from early voting and mail ballots received before Election Day, Question 3, which proposed to implement open primaries and ranked-choice voting, was behind by a substantial margin Only two states — Maine and Alaska — have widespread ranked-choice voting. Though the measure failed this year, it passed in 2022 by a narrow 6 percentage points. The proposal’s failure came amid vehement opposition from the state’s top Democrats and Republicans. Question 6 passes Nevadans have taken the first step to enshrine abortion rights in the state Constitution after overwhelmingly passing ballot Question 6. For more than a year, advocates have sought to further shore up abortion rights in Nevada, part of a nationwide effort to bolster abortion access through ballot questions since the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning ofRoe v. Wadein 2022. If voters pass the question again in 2026, the state Constitution would be rewritten to include that Nevadans have a fundamental right to abortion. Abortion is already legal through 24 weeks into a pregnancy in Nevada, and that would not change with this ballot question. However, it would make it harder to overturn, as existing law can be changed by a one-time majority vote of the people, while two majority votes would be necessary to remove the right from the state Constitution. Question 7 passes Nevada is one step closer to requiring voter ID after voters overwhelmingly passed ballot Question 7. The measure now heads to the 2026 ballot, when another affirmative vote would enshrine a voter ID requirement in the state’s Constitution. The initiative would require all in-person voters in Nevada to present a valid photo identification — such as a driver’s license, passport, student ID card or concealed weapon permit — before voting. People voting by mail would have to include part of a personally identifiable number — such as their driver’s license or Social Security number — alongside their signature. The measure’s success is hardly a surprise, aslimitedpollingshowed strong support for a voter ID requirement. Republicans have been trying to enact voter ID in the state dating back toat least 2015, but have beenstymiedby Democrats. Supporters of the ballot question significantly outraised opponents, and Democrats put few resources toward opposing the question, likely given the public’s overwhelming support. Amodei wins Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) won a seventh full term to the U.S. House in Congressional District 2, defeating self-funded Greg Kidd, who ran as a nonpartisan. Amodei has represented the Northern Nevada-based district since 2011. If he finishes out his term, he will be the district’s longest-serving representative, overtaking former Rep. Barbara Vucanovich (R-NV). The Carson City native had never lost an election by a margin closer than 15 percentage points. While some of the vote is still outstanding, Amodei’s margin looks to be similar to previous election cycles. Kidd spent more than $2 million of his own money on the race and spent far more on the airwaves than Amodei. But the incumbent, who has been involved in Northern Nevada politics since 1996 and never lost a race, still won.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-voters-say-they-are-cautiously-optimistic-in-spite-of-charged-election-season,True,"To soothe her jitters about the election, Connie Hayes plans to spend the day on a hike and commiserating with friends. For the 67-year-old retired government employee, the stakes are incredibly high this election. She contends that nothing short of American democracy is on the line if former President Donald Trump is re-elected. Yet, despite her fears anda presidential race that's neck and neck,Hayes said she believes that Democrats will be able to rally enough votes to catapult Vice President Kamala Harris to victory. Many of her friends, she noted, are Republicans who chose not to vote for Trump, holding similar concerns about democracy. “I think there may be enough clandestine blue people voting. That's my hope,” Hayes said. Like Hayes, most of the other votersThe Nevada Independentinterviewed leading up to the election remained “cautiously optimistic” about Election Day and the country’s political climate. Most didn’t voice heightened concerns about potential political violence or widespread voter fraud — allegations of which, after the 2020 presidential election, were rejected by officials inNevadaand nationally. A lateOctober AP-NORC poll,however, found that about 70 percent of Americans report feeling anxious or frustrated about the 2024 presidential campaign. Democrats reported more anxiety than Republicans about the race, while only about half of nonpartisans (who constitute a plurality of Nevada voters) expressed feelings of stress, according to the poll. Dr. Shairi Turner, chief health officer atCrisis Text Line,a text-based mental health support platform, said she has seen an uptick in election-related anxiety. Currently, the platform is receiving about 100-200 conversations per day related to political anxiety, but she expects these numbers to skyrocket, similar to how they did in 2016 and 2020. Turner said that these conversations range from general mistrust in government to concerns about the rolling back of the rights of transgender people and climate protections. Although Crisis Text Line doesn’t keep track of political affiliation, Turner said the groups that demonstrate the most political anxiety are those older than 65, and those who identify as male, followed by transgender and nonbinary users. Turner was hesitant to pinpoint exact reasoning behind these trends, but offered general strategies on coping with political anxiety such as setting boundaries during discussions with loved ones or recognizing that it can be difficult to shift someone’s political opinion. “I think people become overwhelmed when they're just letting the news bombard them, as opposed to being intentional and saying ‘right for the next half hour, I'm going to watch the news on this station, or I'm going to look for a particular article and get my information there,’” Turner said. Kai Olvera, a 23-year-old health care worker who identifies as queer, said that they fear for their rights under another Trump administration. Last year,17 states passed restrictions on medical care for transgender peopleduring their legislative sessions, and Olvera is worried that transgender rights could be rolled back in Nevada if it tilts red. “There’s this fear that I can't exist and go out in public with the policies and with things that have been going on in the past few years,” Olvera said. However, at a time when other Republican-led states have been passing record numbers of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, last year, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo signed two bills enhancing protections for transgender and gender nonconforming people — a move that theHuman Rights Campaignapplauded. Olvera, who has family members who are undocumented, fears for loved ones’ well-being under Trump, who has promised to conduct a mass deportation campaign if elected, potentially affecting Nevada’s roughly150,000 undocumented people. Despite those concerns, Olvera remains slightly optimistic. “I'm really hoping that, because we have a new influx of new voters and people who just turned 18, that they are voting blue,” Olvera said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/presidential-outcomes-and-nonpartisan-voters-the-top-13-things-to-watch-on-election-day-in-nevada,True,"On the first day of early voting, Nevadans described this year as theelection of their lifetimes, pointing to the swing state’s toss-up status in the presidential race, a U.S. Senate race that could shape control of the upper chamber of Congress, a ballot question that could fundamentally change Nevada’s election system and races that could determine whether Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo can remain a one-man roadblock to the Democratic majority’s agenda in the Legislature. This year’s election also promises insights into the partisan lean of the state’s growing share of nonpartisan voters. As of Sunday evening, 53 percent of registered voters cast their ballots during Nevada’s early voting period, split nearly evenly between mail voters and in-person early voters. Based on historical turnout in past presidential elections, this will likely make up more than 70 percent of the total turnout. There likely are tens of thousands of outstanding mail ballots, which can be counted through Saturday, and there will likely be significantly fewer voters on Election Day after Republicans encouraged early and mail voting for the first time. Here are the storylines we’re watching: Which presidential candidate will win Nevada’s 6 electoral votes? As the smallest of the seven swing states that will decide the presidential race, Nevada’s six electoral votes are a critical part of each candidate’s path to 270 electoral votes. Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have made numerous visits to the swing states to shore up their support. Harris is attempting to recreate the multiracial, multi-generational electoral coalition of Nevadans that has powered Democrats to victories in the presidential race in four straight elections, even as Democrats’ registration advantage has been nearly eliminated. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, sees opportunity in a state where the unemployment rate is higher than the rest of the country and is home to a relatively low rate of voters with college degrees. Could the presidential election come down to Nevada? We might know how important it will be by the time polls close, depending on what’s happening on the East Coast. If Harris and Trump split the midwestern Blue Wall states (Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania), it becomes increasingly important. To learn more about specific scenarios, clickhere. Will Jacky Rosen or Sam Brown prevail in the Senate race? Nevada is one of arguably 10 states where the battle for control of the upper chamber will play out. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) is running for a second term against Army veteran Sam Brown. Rosen has led in polls throughout the cycle — mostly beyond the margin of error — and got out to a hot start by using her financial advantages to begin negatively defining Brown and positively defining herself while the Republican was still fending off primary challengers. Currently, Democrats have a 51-49 majority in the Senate. With West Virginia a virtual lock to flip to Republican control, Democrats must defend all seven vulnerable seats they currently hold to have a chance at Senate control. Nevada is one of those, and as such, both the Rosen campaign and Democratic groups have spent tens of millions of dollars on the race. Republicans also think Nevada is a prime pickup opportunity — and are especially encouraged by the GOP’s strong returns in early voting. Both parties expect it to be competitive, and for good reason — in 2022, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-NV) re-election, by less than 1 percentage point, was the closest Senate race in the country. Will Democrats sweep Southern Nevada’s House races? Democrats have held all three Southern Nevada-based seats since the blue wave of 2018. Even in tough cycles — like 2022 — when Republican groups threw millions at Las Vegas, Reps. Dina Titus (D-NV), Susie Lee (D-NV) and Steven Horsford (D-NV) have hung on. This cycle, outside groups have not spent any money to boost challengers Mark Robertson (CD-01), Drew Johnson (CD-03) and former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee (CD-04). Thus, the Democratic incumbents are much better-funded and have a giant advantage on the airwaves. But, but, but … it’s a presidential year. Turnout will be much higher than the 2022 midterms, and each of these seats have narrow voter registration advantages for Democrats. A strong Trump performance at the top of the ticket could be enough to drag the Republican challengers to victory. These are must-hold seats for Democrats if they want to win back control of the House — losses here, in seats that analysts consider lean towards or are likely safe for Democrats, would be difficult to make up. Will Mark Amodei be unseated by a wealthy nonpartisan? For the first time since 1998, no Democrat is running for Congressional District 2 in Northern Nevada. Instead, Rep. Mark Amodei’s (R-NV) main challenger in the district is Greg Kidd, a wealthy venture capitalist and registered Republican who successfully submitted 1,500 signatures to run for the seat as a nonpartisan. Kidd is largely self-funding his campaign, far outspending Amodei on campaign advertisements and voter outreach efforts. Amodei has never faced a serious challenge, handily defeating the closest contender in each general election he's run in by double-digit percentage points in a district with a 13.4 percentage point Republican advantage over Democrats. But Kidd sees a path to victory in the newly vast pool of nonpartisans, combined with support from Democrats — he has leaned heavily on his pro-abortion rights stance and even earned the endorsement of Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV). Will Democrats secure supermajorities in the Legislature? Democrats, who already hold a 28-seat supermajority in the 42-member Assembly, are one seat shy of the 14 seats needed for a two-thirds supermajority in the 21-member state Senate. The party islooking to secure veto-proof supermajoritiesthis election cycle — an outcome that would prove dire for the political relevance of Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who proved himself a powerful check in 2023 on the agenda of a consistently Democrat-controlled Legislature. In key contests, Democrats and Republicans are neck and neck in fundraising.. Fueled by the “Reid Machine”builtby longtime U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Nevada Democrats havepumped out electoral winsin recent years. The party further bolstered its structuraladvantagesin congressional and legislative races in 2021 through control of the redistricting process, which saw Democratsredraw state maps. Outside of the2014 “red wave” electionand subsequent legislative session, Democrats have maintained control of both houses of the Legislature since 2009. Republicans have had more luck winning the governor’s seat, however, and can play a formidable defense against Democratic legislative majorities. Will Clark County see its first Republican commissioner in more than two decades? Attorney April Becker is vying to become the first Republican in 20 years to be elected to the Clark County Commission. Becker faces Assemblywoman Shannon Bilbray-Axelrod (D-Las Vegas) in the race to represent District C. The seat is being vacated by Democrat Ross Miller who didn’t seek re-election. Becker is an attorney who previously lost races for the Nevada Senate and Congressional District 3. Bilbary-Axelrod, the daughter of the late Rep. James Bilbray, who represented Southern Nevada in Congress from 1987 to 1995, is a four-term state assemblywoman first elected in 2016. Bruce Woodbury was the last Republican elected to the seven-member board. Will voters oust the Washoe County Commission chair? Incumbent Democrat Alexis Hill is facing Republican former Commissioner Marsha Berkbigler to represent District 1 on the Washoe County Commission. Berkbigler held the seat for eight years until Hill defeated her in the 2020 election. The commission came underintense scrutinythis summer when it initially voted not to certify results from a June primary recount after pressure from Northern Nevada Republicans, including far-right election provocateur Robert Beadles. Hill, who is the commission chair, is one of two Democrats on the five-person board who voted to certify the recount results. A majority of the board later joined her. Before her election to the commission, Hill worked in public policy and city planning at the cities of Sparks and Reno. Berkbigler was a lobbyist in the Legislature for more than 40 years. Who replaces the Goodmans as Las Vegas mayor after 25 years? Former Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV) and Las Vegas City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman are running to become the first Las Vegas mayor in a quarter-century not named Goodman. Berkley, 73, served 14 years as a Democratic congresswoman representing a district that included a large portion of the City of Las Vegas. Seaman, 66, is in the middle of her first full term representing the city’s Ward 2. She is a former one-term Republican assemblywoman who was elected to the city council during a special election in 2019 to finish the term of a councilman who resigned. Current MayorCarolyn Goodmanis term-limited. She succeeded her husband, mob lawyer Oscar Goodman, who began the family’s hold on the office in 1999. The Goodmans did not make an endorsement. This year’s mayoral race was dominated by thelong-running land-use disputesurrounding the defunct Badlands golf course that could cost taxpayers upward of $450 million to $650 million. However, the City Council is expected to discuss and possibly voteon a plan Wednesdayto settle the nine-year legal matter for much less. Will Nevada have ranked-choice and open primary voting? A ballot measure seeking to make Nevada the third state after Maine and Alaska to implement ranked-choice voting narrowly passed in 2022 but needs to pass one more time in 2024 to take effect. The biggest changes to Nevada’s election system since the state implemented universal mail-in voting in 2020,Question 3aims to amend the state Constitution by requiring most partisan general elections to move to a system ranking candidates of all parties by order of preference. It would exclude the presidential election but include U.S. Senate and congressional races, legislative elections and statewide office positions. Groups supporting and opposing the measure have poured millions of dollars into advertisements and campaign efforts. The campaign for the measure has focused on the ballot measure's open primary element that would allow people not registered with either major party to participate in the primary. Opponents have criticized that approach as misleading because it does not discuss ranked-choice voting. Will voter ID and abortion ballot questions move forward? Nevadans are voting on two contentious questions that would amend the state Constitution to require voter ID and establish a fundamental right to abortion. Because the questions are constitutional amendments, they would also need to pass in 2026 to take effect. Both questions are widely expected to pass. The voter ID initiative would require in-person voters in Nevada to present a valid photo identification before voting. People voting by mail would have to include part of a personally identifiable number — such as their driver’s license or Social Security number — alongside their signature. If it moves forward, it would mark a long time coming for Republicans who have sought the requirement for years as a commonsense measure to ensure election security. Democrats in the Legislature have stymied any GOP effort on the grounds that it could disenfranchise voters and is unnecessary because ID is required to register to vote. The abortion ballot question is part of a nationwide effort to bolster abortion rights since the fall ofRoe v. Wade. Abortion is already legal through 24 weeks into a pregnancy in Nevada, but enshrining it in the state Constitution would make it harder to overturn. Will Nevada see historical turnout levels? More than 2 million voters are registered in the Silver State. Based on historical turnout data, more Nevada voters tend to cast a ballot in presidential years, and this year could be a record-breaker. In the 2020 general election — which had one of the highest voter turnouts in U.S history— almost 80 percent of Nevada’s registered voters cast their ballot,according to Nevada’s Secretary of State. In 2016, about 76 percent of Nevada’s 1.4 million registered voters turned out. Already, some 53 percent of voters cast their ballots during early voting. So far, nearly 60 percent of registered Democrats have turned out, 67 percent of registered Republicans have already cast a ballot, and about 35 percent of registered nonpartisans have voted. How will nonpartisans swing in the election? Last summer, registered nonpartisan voters became the largest voting bloc in the Silver State. Voter registration data from the end of October shows about 33 percent of Nevada voters are registered as nonpartisan, nearly 30 percent as Democrats, almost 30 percent as Republicans and about 7 percent with a minor party. As the state’s share of nonpartisan voters has ballooned, however, it’s not clear whether nonpartisans tend to lean Democrat, Republican or even plan to cast a ballot in 2024. The state’s automatic voter registration processwent into effect in 2020. It automatically registers people who complete DMV transactions to vote unless they opt out, and a “nonpartisan” registration is the default unless someone proactively chooses a party. It’s led to swelling voter rolls, although many of the newly registered are thought to be disengaged from politics. As one newly registered voter interviewed byThe Nevada Independentin2020 said, “voting’s cool” because you can pick the leader of the U.S. But would he vote in November of that year? “Maybe ... we’ll see,” he said. Will conservatives gain more influence on the Clark County School Board? Big shifts arecoming to the Clark County School Boardfollowing the 2024 election, as three of the four incumbents are not running for re-election. Board President Evelyn Garcia Morales is hoping to retain her seat after facing intense pressure to resign amid controversies, such as formerTrustee Katie Williamsliving out of state. Among the candidates are two former members of the local chapter of the Moms for Liberty, a controversial, conservative “parental rights” group that has pushed for book bans and opposed policies related to LGBTQ+ students. Although they broke away from the local chapter due to personal differences, they say they still stand by its values. A third affiliate, Tim Underwood, is running for the State Board of Education District 1. All of their opponents areendorsed bythree current trustees. The trustees also endorsed Garcia Morales’ opponent.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-when-will-we-know-nevadas-election-results,True,"In the 2020 election, President Joe Biden was not declared the winner of Nevada’s electoral votes until four days after Election Day. Is it possible we’ll have to wait that long again? The short answer is yes. Nevada law allows all mail ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted until 5 p.m. on Saturday, and mail ballots with an unclear or no postmark must be counted by Friday at 5 p.m. Those statutes were upheld this year despitemultiplelawsuitsfrom state and national Republicans. As a result, in the event of a razor-thin margin like in 2020 (Biden won by about 33,000 votes out of 1.4 million ballots cast), election forecasters may not be comfortable calling the race until days after Election Day because of the possibility of outstanding mail ballots. In the 2022 midterms, about 6 percent of Clark County votes and 3 percent of Washoe County votes were received after Election Day. The highest number of mail votes were received the day after Election Day, but there was a steep dropoff the next day, according to thesecretary of state’s office. Additionally, Nevadans who have to cure the signatures on their mail ballots have until Nov. 12 to do so, which means a small number of results could trickle in one week after Election Day. On the other hand, the unique circumstances of this year’s election and changes in the state’s counting rules could mean the public has a clearer sense of the state of the race earlier on Election Day. Ahead of this year’s June primary, the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office released new guidance that allowed county election officials to begin counting in-person early votes at 8 a.m. on Election Day. Counties must also report their first batch of results by 6 p.m. on Election Day for verification and quality assurance. People with access to the vote counts before all polls close and results are released must sign a form agreeing to not disclose them, and could face felony charges if that agreement is violated. State law on that point is the same as it was in 2020, but without explicit guidance to count ballots early on Election Day, county election officials likely counted early votes much later in the day that year, according to the secretary of state’s office. County officials have also been allowed to start counting mail ballots on Oct. 21, 15 days before Election Day, as was the case in 2020. This means that, if all goes to plan, the first batch of results publicly posted online on election night should include all of the early in-person votes and mail ballots received before Election Day, according to the secretary of state’s office. In this year’s election, that will likely make up a large majority of the votes, as more than 1 million early and mail votes had been cast as of Sunday. Republicans have encouraged their supporters to use early and mail voting after falsely claiming in 2020 that those two methods would be rife with fraud. Republican voters have heeded leadership’s call — leading registered Democrats by more than 40,000 votes cast as of Sunday — and will likely be turning out in-person on Election Day at much lower rates than four years ago because so many have already cast their ballots. Nevada law also stipulates that no results can be released until the final person voting in-person on Election Day has voted. Polls close at 7 p.m. local time, but people who are in line by that time are allowed to vote. In the June primaries, the polls officially closed at 7:54 p.m., and the first results were posted 10 minutes later, though turnout is going to be much higher in the November elections, which create more lines that keep the polling places open longer. However, onlookers should exercise caution when looking at the initial numbers because it is unknown how many mail ballots may be outstanding.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/democrats-strong-ground-game-has-won-them-tough-nevada-races-before-will-it-still-work,True,"In Reno last week, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) laced up her sneakers to launch an activity Nevada Democrats have made their calling card over the last 20 years — canvassing. “Enjoy the day, knock a lot of doors and turn out the vote,” Rosen told the crowd, advising volunteers to share their reasoning for door-knocking to leave an impression. “Don't leave any door without telling them they have to have a plan to vote.” The next day, in Reno’s Idlewild Park, the Washoe County Republican Party held their own “Trick or Trump” voter turnout event. A woman in a witch hat set up a face painting station; plastic buckets of Halloween candy sat on top of picnic tables next to campaign yard signs and handouts calling for voters to support a voter ID measure on the ballot. The party — and separate get-out-the-vote events hosted by Democrats two weekends before Election Day in Nevada’s most purple county, including a free barbecue food truck near Reno’s Plumas Park — are supplements to broader campaign efforts across the Silver State, the type of in-person events that experts say are an essential part of reaching voters in a critical election year. Canvassers are ubiquitous in neighborhoods across the Las Vegas Valley and Reno. Equipped with packets of addresses to hit, they can see data about the partisan makeup of a household and union affiliation, if the canvassers are union. In an app, they can mark whether anyone answered the door and if they indicated who they would vote for. A broad and well-organized canvassing effort has been the critical instrument in Democrats’ electoral toolbox over several cycles. That superior ground game is why Democrats — despite tied polls, strong Republican turnout in early voting and an electorate that, given its low percentage of college-educated voters, Democratic parties in other states may have lost long ago — still believe in Nevada. But inundated by electoral appeals every two years, many voters are wise to it. Knocks at the door are often only met by the sounds of barking dogs; several houses sported various campaigns’ literature, sitting untouched on porches or in windows. The various groups that canvass for Democrats argue that there’s no replacement for the personal touch of a conversation, even if it takes multiple attempts at the door or over the phone — after all, it’s what’s carried Democratic candidates over the line before. And there’s no substitute for someone high on the ticket, like Rosen, personally firing up the troops to do the hard work. Whether Democrats can out-organize voter frustrations over issues like the economy, or Republicans can use their own strategies to negate some of Democrats’ ground game advantage, will be a key determinant of Tuesday’s outcomes. The Democratic machine A few weeks earlier in Southern Nevada, union members — including some who had traveled from California — gathered at the AFL-CIO headquarters in Henderson. Paul Snow, a member of Teamsters Local 986, is normally a valet at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas. But starting Sept. 28, he was able to take a leave of absence from his job — a stipulation of the Teamsters’ contract — to be paid to canvass on behalf of union-endorsed candidates in the Las Vegas heat. On this particular Wednesday, he and Daniel Cruz, a valet parking attendant at the Mandalay Bay, went door-knocking in the Crestwood neighborhood of Las Vegas. 2024 is far from the first rodeo for the Teamsters — or any Nevada union with a history of political engagement. “Harry Reid built something here in Clark County,” Snow said, referring to the late senator’s eponymous machine. The Teamsters were knocking on doors of union members — agroupthat Joe Biden won in 2020 by 16 percentage points. While local labor leaders, including from the Teamsters, the AFL-CIO, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the mighty Culinary Workers Union Local 226, have endorsed Harris and other top-of-the-ticket Democrats, former President Donald Trump has madesignificant inroadswith rank-and-file members across the country, especially among Teamsters. His proposal to end federal taxation of tips — first announced at a June rally in Las Vegas — is designed to appeal to those exact voters in Nevada: the highly unionized hospitality workers who form the backbone of the local economy. The Nevada state AFL-CIO literature with which union members papered neighborhoods focused on economic issues, highlighting Democrats’ votes for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that has brought thousands of union jobs to Nevada, allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs and efforts to take on price-gouging. In the presidential race, it includes Harris’ support for a domestic workers’ bill of rights and votes to save workers’ pensions. And it warns members about Project 2025, the right-wing policy document created by former Trump officials that proposed gutting the right to collectively bargain, eliminating overtime pay and ending public sector unions. “As far as the undecided voter, I stay away from a lot of social issues,” Snow said. “My issue is getting across pro-labor candidates.” Across canvassing experiences, the opportunity to have in-person conversations can be hard to come by. Most doors go unanswered — of the dozens of doors he knocked, Snow spoke to two people that afternoon in person. One, a progressive who had wanted to vote for Jill Stein but said he would vote for Harris now that Stein is off the ballot, said his top issue was the war in Gaza. Another, an older woman, talked to Snow for 15 minutes about her concerns over crime and homelessness in the neighborhood and U.S. foreign policy, but ultimately did not commit to either presidential candidate. If they get no answer, Snow said the canvassers will return to the same house up to three times. A house with an inaccessible entryway will get a call from phone bankers; in Las Vegas, with most union members working at casino properties on non-traditional schedules, predicting when people will be home can be a crapshoot. An afternoon with Culinary Union canvassers yielded similar results. The hospitality workers union is peerless in the door-knocking operation, with the group planning to knock on 900,000 doors this cycle in a state where about 1.4 million people voted four years ago. Across more than one hour in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood, Culinary canvassers Norma Torres, who works at Mandalay Bay, and New York New York employee Hector Medina knocked on dozens of doors, but only a few people answered. They said success is a mixed bag, often dependent on things out of their control, such as whether people are home. One man initially joked that he would not be voting in the election, but later conceded that he would be supporting Harris. He filled out a Culinary postcard that will be mailed back to him as a reminder to vote. Sylwia, a nursing home employee who did not disclose her last name, declined to talk with the canvassers but spoke withThe Indy.A Polish immigrant, she was planning to vote for Stein until she was removed from the ballot. She said she would vote early for another third-party candidate after supporting Biden in 2020 — she can’t bring herself to vote for Trump but also doesn’t trust Harris. “You have to think about how you're gonna feel about it,” Sylwia said. But canvassers said those conversations — rare though they may be — and the opportunity to leave campaign literature provides Democrats with a valuable leg up. Ever-present each October since Reid built his famed political machine in Nevada, union canvassers have been the bedrock of Democrats’ impressive ground game. Republicans have struggled to catch up; Snow said in his weeks of door-knocking throughout Las Vegas, he had only encountered one Republican canvasser, working on behalf of Brown, in the field. Being out in the field every day gives the canvassers a unique perspective on the narratives dominating the election. Nevada polls have identified an increased presence of split ticket voters and an increasing rightward drift among Latino voters. Snow said he’s seen both phenomena. He’s encountered voters who plan to vote for both Trump and Rosen. And among Latino voters, he said he’s particularly worried about men, who he finds are more Trump-curious. When he engages with them, he points out that vice presidential candidate JD Vance isopposedto federal legislation that would guarantee the right to organize and notes that some Trump-appointedjudgesareopposedto the National Labor Relations Board and have weakened labor protections. Snow also said that given the fraught political environment, some of the voters he interacts with are “scared to talk to labor,” particularly in mixed-partisanship households. “My job is to get our members to see through that, and say who’s pro-labor,” Snow said. Republican catch-up Though less coordinated than Democratic efforts, Republicans in Nevada are trying to catch up. In Washoe County, volunteers with Trump Force 47 — a group affiliated with the Trump campaign and the national Republican Party — were out in full force two weeks before the election, wearing red jackets and carrying clipboards. Trump’s campaign has also relied on volunteers with local Republican groups, the Elon Musk-backed America PAC, the LIBRE Initiative’s courting of Latino voters and the campaigns of down-ballot candidates such as Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Sam Brown.  Several Republican campaigns did not respond toThe Nevada Independent’s requeststo join ongoing canvassing efforts. But that patchwork approach hasdrawncriticismfor lacking professionalism. In Nevada, the Musk-backed America PAC, to whom the Trump campaign has outsourced much of its canvassing,hiredveteran GOP operative Chris Carr — a savvy move, especially given that Carr was a key architect of the last successful Republican presidential campaign in Nevada in 2004 and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s winning effort in 2022. Still, the group has been dogged by grifting problems.The Guardianhasreportedthat a quarter of door knocks by the group’s paid canvassers in Arizona and Nevada were flagged as unusual and possibly faked. Individual volunteers, however, are keeping the faith. In Reno, Terry Fahami estimates that she’s knocked on 500 homes within the last month and a half as a volunteer for the Washoe GOP. An Iranian immigrant, Fahami said her experience of losing freedoms in Iran and desire to elect a strong world leader as reasons for favoring Trump. Another counterpart of hers, Washoe County Republican Party member Carole Cebrian, said her focus is on turnout, rather than changing voters’ minds. She said as part of the volunteer efforts, she’s developed a broader community and met candidates, including Brown, who kicked off a canvass event where she volunteered. Although she’s focused on registered Republican and nonpartisan voters, Cebrian said Democrats appear to be visiting homes regardless of the resident’s party affiliation. She said she’s gotten calls from Republicans asking how to dissuade Democrats from knocking on their doors and suggested they put a Trump campaign sign in their yard. Democratic canvassers, however, say they’re undeterred — particularly because they have data allowing them to see the partisan affiliation of any household. A house with a Trump sign might still have a registered Democrat inside; besides, canvassers say, it’s an opportunity to encourage Trump voters to choose Democrats further down the ballot. Some Republican initiatives, such as the “Trick or Trump” event, are also trying to cast a wider net. Bud Broomhead, a member of the Washoe County GOP Central Committee who spoke toThe Indywhile testing out the ideal ratio of water to face paint, described the event as an “experiment” designed to engage with non-Republican voters. “This isn't about necessarily getting out our base. It's about building relationships in the community for this election and future elections,” Broomhead said. “One way to do that is to socialize a little bit, have some fun and do something for the kids and the whole family.” It didn’t work on everyone. Amy Hernandez, who lives across the street, thought about bringing her two young daughters but stopped when she saw the Trump campaign signs hung around the pavilion. “This could be a family event, but then you're making it something more,” Hernandez said. “I don't like how they're making a Trump event with trick-or-treating. Why are they involving the kids?” She placed a blue and white sign promoting Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign in front of the large skeleton in her yard. Someone at the Republican event ran over to Hernandez with two bags of candy for her children. Onlookers later wondered if that effort might have earned them some goodwill. Seven touches In advertising, the common wisdom is that people need to see an ad seven times before they remember it. Democratic strategist Riley Sutton, whose firm has knocked about 150,000 doors for 16 campaigns in the state, said the same policy applies to campaigns. “Campaigns try to get that many touches, get themselves in front of voters at least that many times,” Sutton said. “Now, many campaigns can’t get anywhere close to that, but you try to get as many touches on the voters who need to vote for you as you can.” Text messages, digital ads, mailers and door knockers may be perceived by voters as annoying, but Sutton said that doesn’t mean they’re ineffective — a message he shares at the start of canvassing launches. Voters are more likely to vote for the candidates they have heard from, especially in down-ballot races where voters are less likely to have paid attention. “There’s just no evidence to show that repeated touches loses you votes and all the evidence to suggest the opposite,” Sutton said. One change Sutton said he’s noticed this election cycle is that the Harris campaign has encouraged down-ballot candidates to take the lead on canvassing, events and even press conferences. It’s a recognition of the trust in local officials, he said, and is a more efficient use of resources. “It’s a different sort of level and type of engagement that I think shows their understanding of the power of local connection,” Sutton said. “Compared to previous cycles, there’s been a lot less big ticket surrogate visits and a lot more local candidate, local campaign partnering, speaking from the center type of outreach.” The question remains, though, how much a ground game advantage matters. If Democrats carry Nevada, they will likely point to their robust get-out-the-vote operations as a key reason why. But if they lose, it will beg the question — has the power of canvassing diminished at all? The fruits of each group’s labor won’t be known until results come in. Either way, they’ll keep knocking through Tuesday.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/reno-pastor-endorses-republicans-in-violation-of-irs-rules,True,"This story originally appearedon KUNR.organd is being republished as part of a partnership between The Indy and KUNR. On a recent Friday night, the Reverend Dr. Debra Whitlock-Lax took the mic to warm up a crowd of voters who were at her church to hear from candidates running for office in Reno, Sparks, and Washoe County. “If you can hear me, clap your hands!” she said, to applause and cheers. Whitlock-Lax is pastor of Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Sparks. Her church was hosting the forum in partnership with Faith in Action, a nonprofit activist network that organizes people of faith around social issues. She opened the event by asking audience members to commit to vote – but she didn’t say for who. “We don't endorse any candidate,” she said. “But we do invite all candidates to come and be a part, and to show their voices. You know, to share what it is that they're about.” Across town, Pastor Phil McKay of Calvary Chapel Reno Sparks has also been engaged in the election. But he’s taking a different approach. “We've prepared – our community impact team has prepared for you guys – a voter guide, that is going to hopefully help you to be educated on casting your vote so you know who you're voting for and what you're voting for. Amen,” he said duringa recent sermon. McKay preaches a literal interpretation of the Bible, and promotes conservative cultural values, including an opposition to gay marriage and trans rights. And in his church’s voter guide, McKayendorses a slate of Republican candidates. According to experts, that’s a violation of federal tax law. His church’s involvement in politics is also a key component in a national effort to activate evangelical voters for former president Donald Trump. KUNR reviewed dozens of McKay’s sermons, social media posts, and podcast episodes – as well as content from other local pastors. The investigation found McKay’s been working with Turning Point USA and its founder, Charlie Kirk, since at least Nov. 2023, when he hosted Kirk for aquestion-and-answer session at his church. “What would you say to the Christian who is here tonight, struggling with their conscience about voting for a candidate who doesn't align 100% with their biblical values?” McKay asked the 31-year-old Republican activist and campaign operative. “First of all, I'm glad you're here,” Kirk responded. “I'm glad you're contemplating that. So, I mean, obviously the only person they ever say that about is Trump.” Kirk went on to compare Trump to biblical figures like Cyrus II, a Persian ruler who liberated the Hebrews from captivity. According to the Old Testament, Cyrus was anointed by God, even though he was a nonbeliever. “If you were to hire a bodyguard, do you want someone that's polite or someone that can win?,” Kirk continued. “[Trump] is the bodyguard of Western civilization.” As the crowd cheered, McKay responded with an emphatic, “Amen.” Kirk isrunning voter outreach for the Trump campaignin Nevada and other battleground states through Turning Point Action, a social welfare organization related to the Turning Point family of activist organizations, which Kirk established in 2012. But that night at Calvary Chapel Reno Sparks, he appeared under the Turning Point USA Faith brand, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.IRS regulations prohibitsuch tax-exempt organizations from speaking for or against any candidate for public office – a prohibition that extends to churches, too. Notre Dame law professor Lloyd Mayer said both Kirk and McKay broke the law by endorsing Trump. “Charities are free to talk about issues,” Mayer explained. “It's only when they start talking about candidates that we have a problem.” McKay told KUNR he was too busy for an interview before this story was published. And Turning Point never responded to a request for comment. But experts in Christian nationalism say Kirk is building relationships with churches to get evangelical Christians to support the former president. In Reno, he’s also tapped into Center of Hope Christian Fellowship andCONVO Church. Religion scholar Matthew D. Taylor said after the pandemic, Kirk restructured Turning Point around a Christian nationalist philosophy called theSeven Mountains Mandate. It divides societies into distinct areas of influence, or “mountains,” which Christians should seek to control. “There's the mountain of government, the mountain of education,” Taylor said. “The tops of those mountains are either controlled by Satan and the demons or by God and the Christians.” Taylor said adherents to this idea believe once Christians are in charge, they’ll be able to bring the U.S. into alignment with what they deem to be “biblical values,” and bring God’s blessing upon the nation. There’s nothing illegal about promoting those ideas. But according to Mayer, McKay overstepped by promoting a voter guide from the pulpit – which includes at least two members of his congregation:Sam Brown, who’s running for U.S. Senate; and Reno city council candidateDenise Myer. “It's a little surprising that more groups haven't pushed the envelope in this area, especially given the sharp partisan divides we have today,” Mayer said. McKay’s political activities could jeopardize the tax exempt status of his church – at least in theory. But Mayer says it’s doubtful the IRS will look into them, because the agency is short on resources. He also suspects it’s wary of going after churches, especially in this political climate. Back at Bethel AME in Sparks, however, Whitlock-Lax is firmly on the right side of the law. The forum she hosted featured candidates from both major parties, and a few nonpartisan races. The point was to help voters get engaged, no matter who they plan to vote for. “I believe that an educated community is a community that can vote wisely,” she said. ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-their-own-words-what-its-like-in-a-chaos-congress-and-why-these-lawmakers-keep-coming-back,True,"By Lisa Mascaro and Mike Pesoli, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — Polarizing. Challenging. A lot of wasted time. That's how six lawmakers described what it is like being in the U.S. House — a particularly tumultuous period in American history that has brought governing to a standstill, placed their lives in danger and raised fundamental questions about what it means to be a representative in a divided democracy. And yet, they keep at it, running for re-election. TheAssociated Presssat down separately with lawmakers, three Republicans and three Democrats, to hear what it's like on Capitol Hill and what they — and other Americans — can do to make it better. All hail from safe districts and are expected toeasily win another term. Here's who they are, why they first ran for office and why they keep coming back. Dusty Johnson is the rare lawmaker whose sprawling district makes up an entire state, South Dakota. He ran for office in 2018 because he thought there were ""too many jerks"" in Congress and he would be better. Nicole Malliotakis said that as the daughter of a Cuban mother and Greek father, her background made her born for politics. She ran in 2020 to provide a ""counter view"" as a Republican from New York City, representing Brooklyn and Staten Island. Mark Amodei, from Northern Nevada, or ""original Nevada,"" as he calls it, has been in office since 2011. He said it's his responsibility to do public service and give back to the state where his family has lived for generations. Chrissy Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, comes from the western Philadelphia region known as ""the mushroom capital of the world."" The daughter of a Holocaust survivor and mother of a queer daughter, she decided to run for office in 2018 after seeing them in tears after Donald Trump's 2016 election. Veronica Escobar, from the border city of El Paso, Texas, ran for office to work for her community but also to tell the ""El Paso story"" and counter some of the ""negative narratives"" about immigrants. She won election in 2018. Maxwell Frost, the youngest member of Congress, said his initial response to running for office was ""Hell, no!"" But he came to realize his work as the national organizer at March for Our Lives after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, could carry over into Congress. He first won office in 2022. Almost all of them have been in office during two presidential impeachments, two historic House speaker fights, the COVID closures and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. ""All of the things that you could not expect have happened have, have happened,"" Houlahan said. This year in particular has been frustrating ""and in some cases super demoralizing because, you know, you're not here to not do things."" Amodei said, ""I think it's an asset if you know how to play well with others. And if you don't play well with others, then this is a nasty place to be."" Escobar, who was among the lawmakers trapped in the House gallery on Jan. 6, 2021, said: ""I will tell you, I love my job. I'm grateful for my job. It's a tough job."" ""I struggle with that a lot,"" said Houlahan. Houlahan said the House's 435 members operate like ""independent contractors,"" with small staffs and each office's own personality. After a career in the military, as a small business entrepreneur and as a high school chemistry teacher, she said, ""I've never seen anything like the organizational structure that is here."" ""Some of those offices, their mission is chaos, you know, and some of those offices, their mission is constructive,"" Houlahan said. Johnson said it's the wrong question to be asking. ""It's garbage in, garbage out,"" he said. ""And if the people of America are going to continue to elect people who use fear and anger to motivate, we're going to continue to find it more difficult than it should be to get things done in Congress,"" he said. Frost thinks unless there are institutional reforms — campaign finance changes and ending the Senate's filibuster — ""we're going to be caught in this generational cycle of taking a few steps forward and a few steps backwards."" Malliotakis expects it's going to be this way for a while. ""The far right does its thing, the far left does its thing, and then everyone else in the middle really comes together to actually govern,"" she said. ""Congress is a reflection of what's happening in America,"" Escobar said. ""We have families that can no longer talk to one another about politics or about government,"" she said. ""We are drifting so far away from what is so good about our country and our communities, and Congress has a role in fixing that. … But we in our country have to do more of that, as well."" Malliotakis said it would help if Americans paid more attention to what their representatives were ""actually doing when they're in Washington."" ""So many people complain about issues and then they vote for the same members over and over,"" she said. Johnson suggests Americans list characteristics they would seek in a spouse, a boss, a pastor or child and use them when electing a representative. ""Congress can't fix Congress,"" he said. ""The American people can fix Congress."" ""We've all gotten death threats,"" Malliotakis said. ""Obviously, it is a polarizing time right now."" Escobar said she has stopped holding large town hall gatherings over concerns of gun violence. ""I worry that any time I'm gathered with my constituents that one of my constituents could get hurt,"" she said. ""And I worry that my presence at a large gathering could put somebody else's safety at risk."" Houlahan said the risks of violence come with the job. ""This is a job where we are in danger,"" she said. ""It's awful that we're in that place, and we as leaders should be decrying that and not encouraging that."" She said, ""But it is absolutely my expectation that this is not a safe job."" Frost said the threats he receives as a member of Congress are not new to him. ""And I think it just shows, of course, the tone and this kind of violent culture that exists within American politics."" All said getting stuff done — even small wins. Especially the small wins, in fact, because that's about all Congress can accomplish these days. ""There's no other feeling like it,"" said Frost. He described standing at the White House for the launch of the first-ever Office of Gun Violence Prevention. And the ""joy"" he felt when receiving word that the administration would approve a second passport office in Florida, something constituents had been demanding since before he came to Congress. Amodei mentioned work he's done toward a monument for Vietnam War helicopter pilots at Arlington National Cemetery. ""That's neat."" ""The best days are days when you actually feel like you took a vote of consequence,"" Johnson said, whether it's certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election or ""making sure that we don't have any of these silly, stupid dumpster fires."" ""My role as a legislator is to find a solution,"" Escobar said. ""It may not be the perfect solution…. I have constituents who get mad at me for saying that, but progress is incremental."" ""I commute about 5,000 miles a week,"" Amodei said. But what's ""worse is when you feel like you're here and your time is being taken for granted,"" he said. ""I keep coming back because it's work that matters,"" Johnson said. ""I do love what I do,"" Malliotakis said, adding she wants to do ""great work for our constituents."" Houlahan said she envisions a future where Congress turns a corner. ""I stay because I'm hoping that we will find ourselves again,"" she said. ""And I hope that I can be part of it."" Frost said, ""If we step away from our civic power, our opposition is more than happy to step into it for us."" ""The way this institution works should reflect the wants and needs of the people. And so … that's why we've got to keep coming back."" ""Anybody who would act like Congress doesn't matter, I think, is naive to the point of being a bad citizen,"" Johnson said. ""The reality is that every single month, we cast votes that bend the trajectory of this country."" Amodei said, ""Well, fair question, but it's like, well, do you think Social Security is important if you're over 65? Do you think Medicare is important?… Do you think that our borders are important?"" He said he gets the ""uber-cynics"" who say, ""You people are such dysfunctional jerks that we should just get rid of all of you. It's like, OK, so tell me what your plan is."" ""Everything we do here in Washington, D.C., in Congress, impacts every single citizen in this great country,"" Escobar said. Mascaro is the AP congressional correspondent.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/a-national-campaign-to-lessen-polarization-pushes-states-to-ditch-partisan-primaries,True,"By Nicholas Riccardi and Rebecca Boone, Associated Press DENVER (AP) — A national campaign is backing ballot measures in six states to end partisan primaries, seeking toturn down the temperature in a polarized countryby removing a process that gives the most active members of both major parties an outsize role in picking the country's leaders. The $70 million effort to replace traditional primaries with either nonpartisan ones or ranked choice voting is run by Unite America, a Denver organization dedicated to de-polarizing the country. Records show the group donated at least$7.5 million in 2022andmore than $6 millionthis cycle toward the passage of Nevada's Question 3. ""People are losing faith in democracy itself,"" said Kent Thiry, the group's co-chair and the former chief executive officer of the kidney dialysis firm DaVita Inc, during a Denver debate about the initiative on the Colorado ballot. Nick Troiano, Unite America's executive director, said the goal is to end a system where 85 percent of congressional seats are effectively filled in partisan primaries because the districts are so overwhelmingly Democratic or Republican that whoever wins the relevant primary is virtually guaranteed victory in November. Troiano said the Republican congressmen who voted to overturn the 2020 election after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol almost all represented noncompetitive districts and have had to answer only to their party's voters. Supporters are excited at the breadth of the campaign. ""It's eclipsed by the presidential election, but this is the most important year for this sort of structural reform that I can recall,"" said Edward Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University. But some skeptics contend that changing the structure of primaries won't make much of a difference in polarization given how so much of the country lives in either heavily Democratic or heavily Republican communities — and will naturally elect people who occupy those ideological extremes. ""It seems like it's adding political complexity, weakening political parties, and it's not clear what problem they're solving,"" said Lee Drutman of the New America Foundation in Washington, D.C. The ballot measures include proposals to switch to ranked choice voting in reliably Democratic Colorado, evenly divided Nevada and two reliably Republican states where a sharp swing to the right among GOP primary voters have left traditional Republicans scrambling — Idaho and South Dakota. Swing-state Arizona and conservative Montana both have measures to shift from partisan primaries to nonpartisan ones. In deep blue Oregon, an initiative would allow parties to still run their own primaries but require them to use ranked choice voting in certain statewide and federal races. The ballot initiatives come as an unusual number of measures affecting voting are on state ballots in November. Eight states will consider conservative-led measures to ban voting by noncitizens, which is already illegal under federal law. Connecticut voters will decide whether to allow anyone in their state to vote by mail, and Ohio whether to have a nonpartisan commission draw their state's legislative lines. The biggest change in U.S. elections could come from increased adoption of ranked voting. It requires every voter to rank candidates in order of preference. If one does not get a majority, the lowest-scoring candidate is eliminated and that politician's votes are reallocated to whoever their voters picked second. This continues until one candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote. Ranked voting is a more complex way of running elections that is touted as producing winners who better represent the whole electorate. The process is used in two states — Alaska and Maine — as well as a handful of cities such as New York and San Francisco. It allowed a Democrat, Rep. Mary Peltola, to win the race for Alaska's single congressional seat in 2022 even as the state's GOP governor and senator also won re-election. That result angered many Republican activists, who then pushed bans on the process in Republican-controlled states such as Florida and Tennessee. Now, even as additional states consider adopting ranked voting, Alaska voters will consider a ballot measure to repeal it. Critics contend the campaign to attack partisan primaries is an effort to mute the voices of ideologically committed voters. ""This is trying to bring centrism back,"" said Jason Lupo, a conservative political strategist in Colorado who opposes the measure in that state, during a recent debate in Denver. ""This is a way to eliminate progressives; this is a way to eliminate conservatives."" Critics also warn the proposed changes come as conservatives have become more distrustful of election processes following Trump's lies about fraud costing him the 2020 race. ""It does make elections more complicated, and that in turn makes elections harder to trust,"" said Trent England, the founder of the conservative group Save Our States, during a recent debate on the Idaho ballot measure. ""Do we really think that now is the time to be doing that?"" Still, advocates of the ballot measures contend that something has to change. Chuck Coughlin, a veteran Republican strategist in Arizona who used to work for Sen. John McCain, in 2022 wanted to support a Democrat running for Congress in one primary and incumbent Republicans running for county supervisor in the other. But he was allowed to vote only in one primary in a state where the Republican Party had swung sharply to the right. ""I'm like 'I can't do this anymore,""' Coughlin said after 2022, in which every candidate he worked for lost the Republican primary and the GOP nominees for governor, attorney general and secretary of state all lost to Democrats in November because they were too extreme for the state's evenly-divided electorate. ""I can't just run elections to the fringe."" Coughlin was thrilled to get help from Unite America, which donated $5 million to his Arizona initiative earlier this month. The group was founded in 2013 to promote political independents. Troiano, who ran unsuccessfully as an independent for a Pennsylvania congressional seat, arrived to take it over three years later. He's helped steer it toward investing more in structural changes to democracy such as nonpartisan redistricting. Unite America has several wealthy supporters, such as board members Kathryn Murdoch, daughter-in-law of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and Kenneth Griffin, founder of the hedge fund Citadel. Its resources have become a target for opponents of its ballot measures, who contend that ranked choice voting and other changes to partisan primaries will mainly help deep-pocketed candidates win elections. Opponents of the measures zero in on the funding as a reason to oppose the switch. ""It's not the type of people I want writing my election law,"" said Sean Hinga, a labor leader spearheading opposition to the Colorado ballot measure. Boone reported from Boise, Idaho.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/takeaways-from-kamala-harris-closing-pitch-in-nevada,True,"In her final scheduled visit to Nevada this election cycle, Vice President Kamala Harris pitched herself as the only candidate fighting to help the working class at rallies in Reno and North Las Vegas, where she was accompanied by Mexican rock band Maná and actress Jennifer Lopez. In nearly identical speeches lasting about 25 minutes, Harris rehashed a slew of her policies aimed at lowering health care, housing and grocery costs, and characterized her candidacy as a fight for freedom and dignity. About 6,000 people attended the Reno rally, according to the campaign. Crowd numbers for the North Las Vegas rally were not immediately available. The rallies came five days before Election Day, when initial returns are likely to give a clearer picture as to who will carry Nevada’s six electoral votes; the statecould prove criticalin determining the next president. Former President Donald Trump also made hisfinal appearancein Nevada on Thursday during a rally in Henderson, and both candidates’ running mates are coming to Las Vegas on Saturday. Polls have continuously shown Harris and Trumplocked in a dead heatfor the Silver State, mirroring theneck and neck contestsin other battleground states. Registered Republicans have so faroutpacedregistered Democrats in early voting, but much remains unclear, especially given that registered nonpartisansmake upmore than a quarter of all votes cast so far. Harris expressed optimism Thursday that she would prevail in the election. Thursday’s appearance marked Harris’ third time in Nevada — and first stop in Reno — since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket following President Joe Biden’s departure from the race. Sheheld a rallyat Thomas & Mack arena in early August, andanother onein downtown Las Vegas in September. She also made several appearances in the Silver State earlier this year as Biden’s running mate. Before Harris spoke at the outdoor amphitheater at Craig Ranch Regional Park in North Las Vegas, she was preceded by a Maná’s performance, which led to lively dancing in the crowd, and Lopez, who grew emotional as she criticized the racist remarks made at Trump’s rally in New York City over the weekend, including one by a speaker whocalledPuerto Rico an “island of garbage.” “It wasn’t just Puerto Ricans who were offended that day,” said Lopez, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico. “It was anyone with humanity … We are Americans.” In Reno, Harris was interrupted by multiple hecklers — including at least one shouting about the war in Gaza — who were escorted out by security. Harris rolled with the disruptions, noting that “democracy can be complicated sometimes” and celebrating the U.S. as a country where people are free to speak their minds without fear of imprisonment. As heckling continued, she vowed to listen to people who disagree with her “because that’s what real leaders do.” “He wants to put them in jail — I’ll give them a seat at the table,” Harris said. Here are some key takeaways from Harris’ visit. Working class emphasis Bringing down Americans’ cost of living is at the top of her to-do list, Harris said, touting her proposed middle-class tax cut that she said would benefit more than 100 million Americans, as well as tax cuts for small business owners. She also reminded attendees of her proposal to ban price gouging on groceries — which has someeconomists skepticalabout how much it can truly help Americans — and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers, an idea first introduced by Trump at a Las Vegas rally in June. She contrasted those proposals with what she called Trump’s “20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported,” a reference to his plan to impose a 20 percent tariff on American imports that has receivedwidespread criticismfor its projected impact on American consumers. “We know who Donald Trump is because we all know he is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better,” Harris said. She also criticized the Republican plan to make changes to the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care legislation passed under President Barack Obama. In response to an attendee asking “No Obamacare?” at a campaign appearance this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA)said“No Obamacare. [It] is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.” Johnson later denied saying he would support repealing the law, and the Trump campaignsaidthat he does not support repealing it, though he made multiple failed attempts to do so while president. Dignity and freedom As she has throughout the campaign cycle, Harris described her potential presidency as one that would uphold dignity and fight for people’s freedoms. She leaned into her support of abortion rights — contrasted by how Trump “hand selected” three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade — and encouraged attendees to support Question 6 on the Nevada ballot, which would be the first step in enshrining abortion rights in the Nevada Constitution. She also criticized Trump for his recent statement that he would be the protector of women “whether they like it or not.” “He does not believe women should have authority or agency over their own bodies,” Harris said in Reno. The idea of freedom was also prevalent among members of Nevada’s congressional delegation who spoke before Harris. “This is the ‘f around and find out’ election,” Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) said in North Las Vegas. “When they come for our freedoms, we are coming for you” Harris also centered her pitch around “dignity,” especially in regards to herproposalintroduced this month to broaden Medicare coverage to also cover home health care. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz highlighted it at a Reno rally earlier this month, but this was Harris’  first time mentioning the proposal at a Nevada rally. “It's about dignity and it's about values that you bring to your position of leadership,” Harris said. “We're done with the idea that the measure of the strength of the leader is based on who you beat down, when we know the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.” Optimism in the home stretch In her previous stops in Nevada, Harris emphasized that she remained the underdog in the race — but her tone was different on Thursday. “Make no mistake. We will win,” Harris said. “We have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done with that. We're exhausted by it.” The optimism was on display among attendees. Stacey Martin drove to the Reno rally from Davis, California, to “cheer on the next president of the United States.” Martin, who supports Harris for her stance on reproductive rights, isn’t worried how close the race is. “I’m not concerned,” she said. “She’s got this.” While Harris was optimistic about the state of the race, Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) acknowledged the early voting turnout numbers in Nevada. “Republicans are kicking our ass at early voting,” Titus said in North Las Vegas. “We cannot let that happen.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-makes-final-pitch-to-nevadans-cheers-gops-early-voting-totals,True,"Former President Donald Trump likely made his last stop in Nevada before Election Day on Thursday afternoon, flaunting Republicans' high early voting turnout, deriding Vice President Kamala Harris as “low IQ,” and bemoaning the state of the economy and a spike in unauthorized immigration. “You wouldn't put Kamala in charge of, literally, a kindergarten class,” Trump said near the end of his nearly 95-minute speech at the nearly full 5,600-seat Lee’s Family Forum in Henderson. The talk was inter-spliced with video clips and longer versions of his campaign ads. “At the end of the day, you need to ask yourself, can you afford to put someone that's grossly incompetent in charge of the future of our country? I don't think so,” Trump said. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony and Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown served as warm-up acts for the audience and spoke ahead of Trump, who recognized their presence from the stage. Trump acknowledged Brown several times. He was sitting in the audience alongside Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY). Lombardo’s appearance is especially significant, marking his first on stage at a Trump rally this year, although he endorsed the candidate back in January. Lombardo previouslyexpressed concerntoThe Nevada Independent’sCEO and Editor Jon Ralston about Trump’s legal trouble and has distanced himself from six state Republicanswho falsely certified that Trumpwon in 2020. In his speech, Lombardo reminded voters of the local stakes of the election and that Democrats are just one seat shy of a state Senate supermajority, which, if secured, could give them the ability to override his vetoes. “If we are to bring President Trump back into office, it will have a direct effect on our senatorial position, congressional positions, and more importantly, on our Legislature,” Lombardo said, suggesting his picks for the Legislature could ride Trump’s coattails into office. Trump acknowledged Lombardo’s presence at the outset of the speech but didn’t bring him on stage. Gaetz contended that Trump would counter political corruption, by imposing congressional term limits and banning trading on individual stocks. The Florida Republican, however, has come under ethical scrutiny himself — he has beenunder investigationby the House Ethics Committee over allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct with a minor and used illicit drugs. Several times during the talk, Trump brought upa comment earlierthis week from President Joe Biden that sparked immediate backlash from many who interpreted them as referring to Trump’s supporters as “garbage.” “I think I've heard it more than any other word,” Trump said. “How stupid is a man to say that, right? How stupid is Kamala to say that?” Trump also appeared angered by comments from retired Marine general John Kelly, his longest-serving chief of staff, who said in an interview forCNNreporter Jim Sciutto’s book,The Return of Great Powers, that Trumppraised aspects of Hitler’s leadership. “He said, ‘Well, but Hitler did some good things,’” Kelly recalled. “I said, ‘Well, what?’ And he said, ‘Well, (Hitler) rebuilt the economy.’ But what did he do with that rebuilt economy? He turned it against his own people and against the world.” Kelly admonished Trump: “I said, ‘Sir, you can never say anything good about the guy. Nothing.’” Trump, invoking his late father, fired back. “My father was a great guy. He was a strong guy, but a good guy with a big heart,” Trump said. “He told me once … never use the name Nazi. You don't use that name. You understand me? And never use the name Hitler. I’m now beingaccused of being Hitlerby these lunatics out there that have lost control of our country.” Here areThe Nevada Independent’smain takeaways: Enthusiasm for early voting Trump once againtouted Republicans’ unprecedentedturnout lead in early voting in Nevada.  As of Thursday afternoon, theGOP has a substantial42,000-ballot lead, just under 5 percent. “We've been setting records in early voting, but we can't let up,” Trump said on the Nevada totals, reminding those in attendance that the last day to early vote is Friday. He also nodded to making changes to the election system, such as imposing voter ID laws, and claimed that CBS News and other major media companies like NBCengaged in election interference, asserting that they should lose their licenses and be “locked up.” “We’re gonna see it all changed,” he said. Trump also implored those who had yet to vote to do so on Tuesday. “With your help, we're going to win Nevada. We're going to defeat Kamala,” he said. Immigration At the beginning of the rally, Trump played a clip featuring the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, who was found dead in the Houston area in June. Two undocumented Venezuelan immigrants are suspected of the crime. “For thousands of people around our country, this is a constant,” Trump said. Although there are no national statistics,research showsthat undocumented people do not commit crimes at higher rates than American citizens and there were some21,000 homicides recorded in 2020. Once again, Trump reiterated his plans to launch a mass deportation campaign if elected and promised to impose the death penalty on immigrants who kill U.S. citizens or law enforcement officers. Later on in the rally, he brought onstage Gary Quets, the father ofArizona resident Nicholas Quetswho was killed while driving in Mexico. Gary Quets added that Mexicans who kill American citizens should be extradited to the U.S. to be prosecuted. Toward the end of the speech, Trump again brought up illegal immigration, vowing to defend the border. “We will stop illegal immigration, once and for all,” Trump said. “We will not be invaded, we will not be occupied, we will not be overrun, we will not be conquered.” According to thePew Research Center, the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2022 was still below the peak of 12.2 million in 2007. Tax cuts Trump flexed his plan to eliminate taxes on overtime, Social Security and tips — the latter of which he said was inspired by a waitress he met at his non-gaming Trump International Hotel near the Strip that owns in partnership with billionaire Phil Ruffin, owner of Circus Circus and Treasure Island. He reiterated his plan, saying he would “massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses, and we'll have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits.” Trump told the audience Harris would “launch a war on tip workers” by increasing the tip allocation tax by 60 percent. Harris has her own plan for tip tax cuts — it would still exempt tips from federal income tax, but tipped earnings would still be subject to payroll taxes because funds go to Social Security and Medicare. Harris’s plan would also cap the amount of income workers could claim came from tips. The Washington Postreported Harris’s advisers have discussed only exempting taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers who earn $75,000 per year or less.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/las-vegas-city-council-could-vote-to-settle-badlands-lawsuit-after-the-election,True,"The long-running land-use dispute between the City of Las Vegas and the owner of the defunct Badlands golf course could be on the path toward a resolution next week, just after an election in which it has been a key issue. The city council is expected to discuss and possibly vote on a plan to settle the nine-year legal matter by paying between $250 million and $286 million to the developer. That’s less than half of what the city could have had to pay in the dispute. The vote is expected to come the day after Las Vegas residents elect a new mayor and council person. Badlands has been one area of agreement between the two mayoral candidates, former Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV) and Councilwoman Victoria Seaman. Both have advocated settling the matter once they take office. In August, the city council approved spending $500,000 on outside lawyers to continue the lawsuits, which were thought at the time to potentially cost taxpayers upward of $450 million to $650 million. Seaman voted against the payment. A source familiar with the matter but not authorized to discuss the lawsuit said representatives of Badlands owner Yohan Lowie and the city attorney’s office have been in discussions about settling the lawsuit, but a financial agreement has not yet been reached. City spokesman Jace Radke said Thursday a favorable vote by the council would allow the city attorney to negotiate a final settlement with the developer under the financial parameters set by the city. He said if an agreement to end nine years of litigation could be reached quickly, the matter could be back in front of the council in December – the last council meeting for Mayor Carolyn Goodman — for final approval. In an emailed statement, Berkley said she was aware of the agenda item. ""This would bring great relief to both taxpayers and the developer, potentially ending this costly, long-standing nightmare that began almost a decade ago and has impacted the city of Las Vegas significantly,"" Berkley said. According tothe agenda item, funds for the settlement would come from the city’s Liability Insurance and Property Damage Fund. The legal battle began shortly after subsidiaries of EHB Cos., where Lowie is CEO, purchased the 250-acre golf course near Alta Drive and Rampart Boulevard in 2015 to turn it into an expansive housing community. Residents of the adjacent Queensridge neighborhood opposed the project and the city blocked the development. During a mayoral forum in September, Berkley and Seaman agreed the city needed to end the Badlands litigation but disagreed on how to go about the process. “I also think a change of leadership at the top will go a long way into moving the city council in the direction of yes,” saidBerkley, who lives in the Queensridge community, which is bisected by Badlands. “Even before I get sworn in, I'm going to sit down with my fellow council members and ask how we can get to yes.” Seaman was first elected to the council in 2019 followinga recall campaignover a previous councilman's handling of the Badlands issue. She was critical of how Goodman handled thelong-running land-use disputeduring an interview withThe Nevada Independent. “I don't think she [Goodman] did the right thing when it came to Badlands,” Seaman said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/from-the-presidential-race-down-nevada-matters-but-how-much,True,"Nevada is one of the seven swing states that will decide the election. It’s why presidential candidates and their surrogates keep showing up in the Silver State — and why the “We Matter” mantra has stuck. But are we essential? That’s a different story. The Indyanalyzed the various scenarios in which Nevadans will decide the next president, as well as control of the U.S. Senate. There are a few scenarios in which the election will come down to Nevada. There are more where, depending on what happens on the East Coast and in the Midwest, it comes down to us and Arizona. And while it’s unlikely that the counting goes this quickly in the Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, we could know who the president is before polls even close here. Here are a few trends to pay attention to in other states to know exactly how much we’ll matter Tuesday night. Presidential Vice President Kamala Harris’ simplest path to the presidency is to win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Former President Donald Trump needs to pick off one of the “Blue Wall” states and then, depending on which one, win two to three of the Sun Belt states. If the Blue Wall splits, Nevada becomes exponentially more important to each candidate’s calculus. Within that scenario, if Georgia and North Carolina — each worth 16 electoral votes — go to different parties, the likelihood increases that Nevada will be the decider. There are a few scenarios in which Trump and Harris get three swing states apiece, and the mathematical configuration makes Nevada necessary to get to 270. Two of them require Trump to win Pennsylvania, so if you’re the kind of sicko who only cares about Nevada’s importance and not about the outcome, you should root for that. Those are: The final scenario is the very unlikely — but not impossible — 269-269 tie. For that to happen, Trump would need to sweep the Blue Wall states, while Harris would take North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona. In that case, if she wins Nevada, she wins the race; if Trump wins Nevada, we’re knotted at 269. Senate Republicans will gain a seat in West Virginia, with Republican Gov. Jim Justice’s victory a near certainty in the race to replace retiring Sen. Joe Manchin (I-WV). That puts the Senate, where Democrats currently have a 51-49 majority, at 50-50, and makes every competitive Senate race a potential decider between a tied Senate or a wider majority. The more that incumbents in other states hold onto their seats, the more likely that Nevada will determine control of the chamber. If Democrats hold seats in Arizona, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and Republicans hold seats in Florida and Texas, then Nevada’s Senate race determines if the chamber is 50-50, if Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) wins, or 51-49 for the GOP, if Republican Sam Brown wins. Prognosticators expect Republicans to take control of the Senate, with the size of the majority in question. Sens. Jon Tester (D-MT) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH), running in red states where Trump is sure to win, are in the most danger. If Tester or Brown, or any of the other Democratic incumbents, lose, then the Nevada Senate race will determine exactly how big the Republican majority is. If only Tester loses, for example, then eyes will be on Nevada — a Rosen win, holding the Republican Senate majority at 51-49, would make the handful of Republican moderates among the most powerful people in the upper chamber. And if Republicans were to gain a seat, but Democrats also pick one up in Texas, Nevada could again be the decider. A few caveats here. Several states might still be counting ballots by the time polls close in Nevada. So we likely won’t know the exact terrain of the Senate. And a 50-50 Senate is controlled by the president’s party. So if all Democrats hold, including Rosen, but Trump wins the presidency, then Republicans will still control the Senate — and those moderates become even more important, as the likely deciding votes on various policy initiatives. Recall 2017, for example, when a few Republicans, made famous by the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain’s famous “thumbs down” vote, joined forces with Democrats to kill a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. House We don’t expect to know which party will control the House for quite some time, because a majority in either party is expected to be slim and will hinge on several races in notoriously slow-counting California. But the lowdown on the House, where Republicans currently have a 220-212 majority, is the following. If Democrats hold their three seats in Las Vegas, it doesn’t necessarily have any implication on a majority. Democrats are expecting to hold those seats; Republicans don’t believe their path runs through Las Vegas, and thus have not spent any money there. If Republicans do manage to win — even just one seat — then that’s an unexpected pickup and a portent of a good night for the GOP’s odds of keeping, and perhaps even expanding its majority.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/manager-of-a-key-nevada-swing-county-goes-on-medical-leave-ahead-of-election,True,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — The manager of a key swing county in Northern Nevada is out on medical leave, a departure announcedjust days before the election. Washoe County has received attention in recent weeks after turnover at the top of the elections office there. Now, with the departure of Manager Eric Brown, both elections and county government operations will be overseen by deputies during what is expected to be a very close election in this politically important county. The county confirmed Tuesday that Brown is on leave for a planned medical procedure and will be out through late November. Assistant County Manager Dave Solaro will step in until Brown returns. County officials are trying to quell any concerns that the shuffling of staff would affect operations in Nevada's second most-populous county. County spokeswoman Bethany Drysdale said that Solaro served as the interim manager for several months before Brown was hired in 2019 and that he has been with the county for more than two decades. ""(Solaro) joins the rest of the county team in wishing Manager Brown well and looks forward to taking on the tasks at hand during the short period of time,"" she said in an email toThe Associated Press. Last month, the county announced that interim Registrar Cari-Ann Burgess requested medical leave to deal with stress.But Burgess said she was forced outafter refusing to go along with personnel changes sought by Brown's office. She said she asked repeatedly to stay, even providing a doctor's note vouching for her health, and has hired a lawyer. Overseeing the office now is Burgess' deputy — the fifth person in four years to run the county election operation. The turnover is one symptom of a county that is closely divided politically and has been buffeted by election conspiracy theories since Republican Donald Trump lost the state to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. The county has maintained that it's ""focused on conducting a smooth and fair election."" George Guthrie, a spokesman in the registrar of voters office, said in an interview Tuesday before Brown's medical leave was disclosed that employees in that office appeared to be in good spirits while working hard. ""Election time is go-time for us. This is our Super Bowl. The primary is the playoffs,"" Guthrie said. ""Our people are locked in, working long hours, 12-hour days and weekends.""

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/an-elections-worker-wanted-to-serve-her-country-a-stew-of-conspiracy-theories-and-vitriol-awaited,True,"By Christina A. Cassidy, Associated Press RENO, Nev. (AP) — One morning last month, Cari-Ann Burgess did something completely unremarkable: She made a quick stop at a coffee shop on her way to work. For Burgess, the top election official in Washoe County, such outings could be precarious. As she waited for a hot tea and breakfast sandwich, an older woman approached. ""She proceeded to tell me that I should be ashamed of myself — that I'm a disgrace, I'm an embarrassment to Washoe County, and I should crawl into a hole and die,"" Burgess said in an interview withThe Associated Pressthe following day. A morning stop at the coffee shop would be no more. It was added to a growing list of things Burgess no longer did because of her job. She already had stopped shopping for groceries and other basic necessities. Meals were eaten at home. If she and her husband did eat out or go shopping, they would travel an hour away from their Reno neighborhood. ""I go to work, I go home, and I go to church – that's about it,"" Burgess said. ""I'm very cautious now about where I go."" Still, Burgess said she was looking forward to November and overseeing the presidential election with her team in Nevada's second most populous county. That came to an end one day toward the end of September, when she was called into a meeting with county officials. The county said Burgess requested medical leave to deal with stress and it has referred to her departure as a personnel matter. In a statement, the county said it was ""focused on conducting a smooth and fair election."" Burgess said she was forced out after refusing to go along with personnel changes sought by the county manager's office. She said she asked repeatedly to stay, even providing a doctor's note vouching for her health, and has hired a lawyer. Overseeing the office now is Burgess' deputy — the fifth person in four years to run the county election operation. The entire staff is new since 2020. The turnover is one symptom of a county that is closely divided politically and has been buffeted by election conspiracy theories since Republican Donald Trump lost the state to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Burgess, in her first public remarks since her abrupt departure, told theAPthis past week that she was worried about her team and was at a loss on what to do next. She even put off voting, saying it was a reminder she was no longer part of a process she loves. ""I was giving 110 percent of who I was, who I am to this job. And then all of a sudden I'm out and I don't understand,"" Burgess said as she considered her next steps. ""I don't understand how we got to this point."" AP journalists were in Reno in September, a week before her departure, and spent several days with Burgess that included time at the Washoe County elections office and at her home. As with those who preceded her, Burgess and her staff had been in a pressure cooker, subject to biting criticism at public meetings and made to answer conspiracy-fueled claims about voting machines, drop boxes and voter rolls. Dealing with members of the elected county commission who distrust elections made the job even more difficult. Burgess was an extreme case of the types of challenges facing local election officials across the United States after four years of false claims that have undermined public confidence in elections and in those who run them. Election workers have faced harassment and even death threats and have taken extra security precautions this year that include adding bulletproof glass and panic buttons. Over the three days that the AP spent with Burgess, she gave no indication she planned to leave her job. She talked extensively about how she was managing the stress for her, her family and her staff. ""I didn't think I was going to be in a place that I am now — so front and center and a hotbed for this election, but I am grateful,"" Burgess said, sitting in her living room and surrounded by inspirational Bible passages and Christian symbols. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. I'm grateful that I am able to serve my country again."" Hanging on a wall was a decorative sign that read: ""God doesn't give us what we can handle, God helps us handle what we are given."" At home on a Friday night, Burgess sat down for dinner with her husband and a close friend whom she considers a brother. Her husband's prayer over the meal included a request to keep Burgess and her team safe. ""I had no idea what we were getting into, but I know that this is something that's very important for Cari. She loves her job,"" Shane Burgess said after dinner was over. ""Sometimes I want to get in the fight, but I know she can handle herself."" Later, Burgess and her husband discussed plans for the weekend. Burgess wanted to take her husband, a baseball fan, to watch Reno's minor league team, the Aces, play before the season ended. ""Not if you're going to be yelled at,"" Shane Burgess told his wife as they sat next to each other in matching recliners. Burgess tried to reassure her husband: ""I can wear a hat."" In the end, they decided not to go. The Washoe County election office sits inside a complex of government buildings a few miles north of downtown Reno. Burgess' office, before she left, was adorned with American flags, a copy of the U.S. Constitution and red, white and blue decorative stars that read liberty, freedom and America. ""Election Heroes Work Here,"" proclaimed a sign outside her office door. She was the fourth person to lead the Washoe County election office since 2020, named interim registrar of voters in January in a 3-2 vote by the county commission. Even though her entire office was new, Burgess said she was impressed at how well the staff had performed amid all the pressure of working in a high-stress environment. ""I have an amazing staff who all have their part and who do their job to perfection,"" Burgess said. Across parts of the U.S., local election officials exhausted by the harassment and demands of the job have retired or left the profession entirely. Even Burgess had stopped working in elections after being harassed in public by people upset Trump had lost the 2020 election, even though he had easily won the Minnesota county where she worked at the time. After that election, she moved to North Carolina and was working at a beachside ice cream shop when she felt called to return to elections while watching fireworks on the Fourth of July. ""I was like, I can't not serve my country the way I have,"" she said. ""And coming from elections and knowing elections, I'm like, that's something I can get back into. I can do elections again."" Arriving in Washoe County, where the Sierra Nevada transitions to the high desert, Burgess encountered a county mired in voting-related conspiracy theories. County meetings are often prolonged by members of the public who opposed Burgess' hiring and who want the county to hand count votes because they don't trust voting equipment. ""It feels like you're on the front line, but it's a different front line. It's the front line of democracy — not the front line of combat,"" Burgess said. ""But the way the country is divided at the moment, it feels like combat because every day you're combatting some misinformation."" Burgess said a commission vote earlier this year to refuse to certify two recount elections from the state primary hurt morale in the election office. Afterward, she said, two staffers were in tears. There had been no significant issues during voting and no errors when the votes were counted, she said. With the commission under increasing public pressure, it eventually relented and voted to certify. Every morning, when office assistant Shawna Johnson arrives, she updates the whiteboard with the latest countdowns for early voting and Election Day on Nov. 5. On this day, it was 28 days and 45 days, respectively. She also makes sure to add one more: ""95 days til Christmas."" ""We know what our focus is — it's getting to early voting and then getting to Election Day,"" Johnson said. ""But you got to look forward to what happens after all of that. We'll be able to get back to our normal lives, regular hours, being at home with our families, celebrating holidays."" A few days before her departure, Burgess had brought in a consultant to lead training for staff on how to manage stress. That included the importance of taking regular breaks, getting enough sleep and building a support network of friends and family. ""Realizing that I have trauma from 2020 and that I have the PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), I don't want that to happen to my team,"" Burgess said. ""They deserve better. They deserve to know how to take care of themselves."" At one point, Burgess reminded her team to take some time off because everyone would be working weekends starting the first week of October. Privately, Burgess acknowledged time off for her staff would likely mean more work for her. In the two months before the election, she expected to be working 13-hour days. ""If they can't be there, I need to be,"" Burgess said. ""There's just that many things that need to get done for an election."" Among the many things for Burgess to do were security upgrades at the election office.Around the nation, personal safety and the security of election offices have become top concerns amid threats and harassment of election workers. Soon after Burgess said she was harassed at the coffee shop, she had a walk-through to discuss security measures to implement before the November election. Among the recommendations was placing a film over glass windows that can slow, but not stop, bullets. ""That's when I realized I have a lot more dangerous job than I actually expected. It should never, ever be like this,"" Burgess said. Burgess, for the most part, said she kept those concerns to herself. She said she wanted to keep her team focused on running a smooth and secure election. That included making sure poll workers were well trained. The day of the incident at the coffee shop, Burgess recalled that after she finished working, she closed the door to her office and shut the lights off. She sat on her office couch and prayed for comfort and strength. ""I could go somewhere else where it's a lot easier,"" Burgess said. ""I could get out of elections completely. That's not in me. It's not in me to leave something I love."" Less than a week later, she was gone, a decision she said was made for her. And Washoe County, once again, would have someone else in charge of its elections. ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/experts-weigh-in-on-how-ranked-choice-voting-could-transform-nevada-elections,True,"Nevada voters will weigh in this cycle on the biggest change to the state’s election laws since universal mail-in ballots were introduced in 2020: a ballot measure that would implement open primaries and ranked-choice voting. It’s attracted opposition from both major parties — something that proponents say shows the ballot question takes power away from the two-party system and distributes it to the voters. “When you already have a lot of calculus done on how to get your candidates that the party approves of through the primary and to the general, you're not going to want that messed with,” said Sondra Cosgrove, executive director of Vote Nevada and a backer of the measure, said at IndyFest earlier this month. During a 50-minute panel discussion atThe Nevada Independent’s annual politics and policy-focused conference, Cosgrove, Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar and Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nevada Athar Haseebullah discussed the measure, Question 3, as well as a voter identification ballot measure, Question 7, threats to the election system and more. Question 3 is twofold. It would require most partisan elections in Nevada to have a primary that is open to all voters — not just those registered with the two major parties —  with the top five vote-getters (regardless of their political party) advancing to the general election. It also would establish a general election ranked-choice voting system. The measure would exclude presidential and local government elections but affect contests for U.S. Senate and congressional races, the Legislature and statewide office positions. If passed next Tuesday, the open primary and ranked-choice voting ballot measure would be enshrined in the Nevada Constitution and go into effect in 2026. Voters narrowly passed the ballot measure in 2022. Aguilar said if the measure passes, it’s his responsibility as secretary of state to implement it. He warned, however, that as the state has focused on speeding up the release of results on Election Day, the ballot measure could delay those results. “This is going to change the way we operate elections from an administrative perspective. It'll change the way the ballot is laid out, it'll change out the way we do the tabulation and then the way we give results,” said Aguilar, who is neutral on the proposal. “And that is my concern.” He said staff at his office will have to focus on voter education, work to build capacity to implement the ballot measure and build trust among voters — no easy feat. Aguilar also said that a lag in reporting in 2020 led to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, and he worried that drawn-out wait times could exacerbate it. Cosgrove responded to Aguilar’s concerns about the delayed reporting by pointing to Alaska’s voting system, which used ranked-choice voting in 2022. She said Alaska had almost the same mail-in ballot rules as Nevada, and it took the state about half an hour on election night to get the results. “There was no lawsuits, there was no outcry that something bad had happened,” she said. “I would hope … that we can handle doing voter education and that we can be just as transparent here.” Though Democrats and Republicans have opposed the proposal, the ACLU of Nevada is neutral on the measure. Haseebullah said there are pros and cons, but he finds it disingenuous that proponents of the measure have focused on open primaries and not ranked-choice voting. “[The system is] not unheard of, but it is new to Nevada voters,” he said. “However it plays out, we'll be prepared, either way, to defend against challenges that might end up ensuing as a result.” To watch the full panel,click here. We’ve highlighted parts of the discussion below. Voter identification On the ballot this year is a proposed voter identification law. The measure, supported by Republicans and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, would amend the Nevada Constitution to require all in-person voters in Nevada to present a valid photo identification — such as a driver’s license, passport, student ID card or concealed weapon permit — before voting. By law, whenNevadans register to vote, they must prove identity and eligibility through strong, specific identification processes, including providing a valid form of identification or verifying identity via a Social Security number. The state usessignature verificationto identify voters. During the panel, Haseebullah described the proposal as a solution in search of a problem. He said that historically voter identification laws have been used to suppress votes and are rooted in Jim Crow-era policies, and the policy disproportionately affects people with disabilities, people who are unhoused, those who are low-income and cannot afford identification or don’t have the time or ability to get one. “We've talked about the concept of this being a potential poll tax. Not everybody has easy access to an ID,” he said. “The court actually punted on the substantive portion of whether or not, in fact, it is a poll tax. So we think that there's barriers there.” The ballot measure may also have the unintended consequence of enshrining mail-in balloting into the state Constitution, Haseebullah said, because it discusses what to do for mail-in ballots. If there’s a lawsuit regarding the measure, “you could end up with a scenario where you don't have in-person voter ID, and now you have permanency with respect to mail-in voting.” Though voter identification laws are popular in Nevada, Haseebullah said support is stemming from unfounded distrust in the election system. Aguilar said his office is prepared to implement the will of the people. It’s worth noting, he said, that voting is a constitutional right and comparing buying a beer with an ID is not accurate, because purchasing a beer is not a fundamental right. There’s also no evidence of widespread voter fraud, he said. Voter security and intimidation Haseebullah said what keeps him up at night is the prospect of misinformation and disinformation about the election fueling violence. “We expect there to be protests, regardless of the result,” he said. “Leading into January, you're going to see at least half the country likely upset … We're hoping we do not have something occur that was as violent as Jan. 6 again.” The ACLU of Nevada has already seen attempts to push disinformation, Haseebullah said, especially around the process of vote certification, whichhas been targetedas a way to throw a wrench into the election system. In a recount of the June primary, Washoe County became one of at least 25 jurisdictions since 2020 where officials overseeing election certification processes voted not to do so, often citing unsubstantiated accounts of election fraud. Though officials did the right thing and eventuallycertified the recount, Haseebullah said, the Nevada Supreme Court punted on clarifying the role of counties in certification, leading to a “problematic” level of uncertainty. Aguilar emphasized that it’s vital for the public to understand that “a polling location is sacred” and he and his team have met with county clerks, district attorneys and law enforcement to ensure that they are prepared for any scenario, although he doesn’t want uniformed officers at polling locations. The Nevada Secretary of State's Office also has the election integrity task force, he said, which consists of federal, state and local law enforcement officials and representatives from his and the attorney general's offices. He said the task force allows officials from across jurisdictions to work together to address issues in real time at a central location. If voters face intimidation at the polls, Cosgrove said, they should remember that there are multiple vote centers so they can choose alternative locations to cast a ballot. She said one of her biggest worries is voters not casting a ballot.In the June primary, there was a 19 percent turnout rate, she said, leading to some people having an outsized influence in the general election. “We have a lot of young people. We have a lot of new residents, people who are just not voting,” Cosgrove said. “We need to get them into the system, and we need to hear their voices.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-supreme-court-rules-non-postmarked-ballots-can-be-counted-within-3-days-of-election,True,"The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that election officials can count mail ballots with no postmark received as many as three days after Election Day. In adecisionMonday, five of the high court’s seven justices disagreed with the Republican National Committee’s (RNC) interpretation of the law at the center of the lawsuit and determined it would not be in the public interest to change election procedures this late in the cycle. Justices Douglas Herndon and Kristina Pickering agreed with the ruling but disagreed with the majority’s interpretation of the law in question. The ruling upholds a Carson City judge’sdenialof the Republicans’ request in August to stop the counting of these ballots. It is the latest defeat in the barrage of lawsuits filed by state and local Republicans related to Nevada’s mail ballot laws and voter roll maintenance, none of which have resulted in GOP victories, though one is pending a ruling and the others are in various stages of appeal. In a statement Monday, an RNC spokesperson accused the court of ignoring the postmark requirement in state law and said it “has undermined the integrity of Nevada’s elections.” ""Requiring ballots to be postmarked on or before election day is a critical election integrity safeguard that ensures ballots mailed after election day are not counted,” the statement said. Bradley Schrager, a Nevada lawyer who typically represents Democrats in election-related proceedings, commended the ruling in a statement. “We are gratified that the Nevada Supreme Court recognized not only that state laws should be construed to favor the rights of voters to cast their ballots and have them counted, but also that lawsuits like this one so close to the general election tend to promote confusion and chaos rather than orderly democratic processes,” the statement said. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office also said in a statement that the ruling ensures the state’s elections will “continue uninterrupted, without the risk of disenfranchising voters through no fault of their own.” In June, former President Donald Trump’s campaign, along with the Nevada GOP and RNC,filed the lawsuitthat sought to stop counting all ballots with no postmark. Democrats and Republicans acknowledged that the suit addressed a miniscule number of ballots, but such a decision could still prove crucial in a state where margins could be razor-thin. The suit centered on the state law thatallowsofficials to count mail ballots postmarked with a date that “cannot be determined” and received within the three days following Election Day. It argued that counting non-postmarked mail ballots — as suggested by the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office in a May memo to county clerks — was a misreading of the law, and that the law was not being followed by Washoe and Clark county officials during the June primaries. The GOP said it was aware of 24 ballots in June that were not postmarked and were received after Election Day. During oral arguments earlier this month, Michael Francisco, the GOP’s lawyer, argued that the state’s counting of ballots with a postmark date that “cannot be determined” indicates that there must be a postmark on a ballot for it to be considered valid. Meanwhile, David Fox, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who frequently represents Democrat-backed causes, argued that the “cannot be determined” phrase is intentionally vague and should also include ballots without a postmark. The high court’s majority concluded that the statute can be reasonably interpreted both ways, but sided against Republicans because of the legislative history of the law. For example, former Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson (D-Las Vegas) said in a 2021 hearing related to the legislation that the statute is intended to include non-postmarked ballots. However, Herndon disagreed with this rationale, writing that the law “is clear and unambiguous that a mail ballot must contain a postmark.” Still, he agreed with the overall ruling — on the basis that the Republicans failed to demonstrate they would suffer an “irreparable harm” if non-postmarked ballots are counted. Pickering, who also disagreed with the majority’s interpretation of the law but supported the ruling, did so because she does not want to change election procedures so close to Election Day. “With mailed ballots already sent to voters and early voting underway, clarity and consistency in election rules are of paramount importance,” Pickering wrote. “It is not in the public interest to change the rules governing this election this close to election day.” The court’s majority also held a similar view. “If a voter properly and timely casts their vote by mailing their ballot before or on the day of the election, and through a post office omission the ballot is not postmarked, it would go against public policy to discount that properly cast vote,” the majority wrote.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-events-abound-as-campaigns-more-aware-that-the-asian-vote-matters,True,"At an Oct. 16 meet and greet with Las Vegas’ South Asian community, attendees snacked onaloo tikkiand Indian chicken tacos, mingled with politicians and took in the moment. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), engaging with community members by name, spoke about growing small businesses and the importance of participating in the election. Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), who represents the Asian American Pacific Islander-heavy (AAPI) Spring Valley and southwestern Las Vegas area, shook hands. And Maya Harris, the vice president’s sister, received an enthusiastic cheer from the audience when she stopped by. Multiple attendees reported that their elderly parents were politically engaged for the first time, excited by the prospect of sending an Indian American to the White House. “I'm feeling very positive, very optimistic,” said Assemblyman Reuben D’Silva (D-North Las Vegas), Nevada’s first South Asian elected official. “Kamala Harris' candidacy has really energized the South Asian community in a very dramatic way. She’s Auntie Kamala.” While Harris’ identity has contributed to outsized enthusiasm within Las Vegas’ South Asian community, campaigns from both parties have traversed the Las Vegas Valley courting AAPI voters, a critical, growing bloc who could decide several of the state’s close elections. As 12 percent of the Nevada electorate — with 45 percentpopulation growthsince 2012 — campaign outreach has reflected the significance and diversity of AAPI voters. Among the seven swing states, Nevada has the highest percentage of AAPI voters. In 2020,exit pollsshowed that AAPI voters backed now-President Joe Biden by an 18-percentage-point margin. Community leaders and Asian Americans working in Nevada politics said that partisanship is often less sticky among AAPI voters, particularly older ones, and that split ticket voting isn’t uncommon. With much lower turnout in 2022,exit pollsshowed AAPI voters broke for Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) by a 14-percentage-point margin, but Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) by only 8 percentage points. Harris’ campaign has hosted akamayan— a communal feast — and announced her “Pinoy pride” in ads to target Filipino American voters. Former President Bill Clinton popped up at Seafood City Supermarket, a popular shopping destination for the Filipino community, to stump for Harris. Sisolak and his wife, Kathy, who is Chinese American, and AAPI Assembly members led a march to polls in Chinatown on Friday. Sam Brown, the Republican candidate for Senate, wore a traditional Filipinobarongand pledged to counter Chinese aggression toward the Philippines. Former President Donald Trump came to Las Vegas on Oct. 24 with key Asian American surrogates to court voters, believing his campaign will grow its margins with AAPI voters this cycle. Eric Jeng, the executive director of progressive AAPI political advocacy group One APIA Nevada, said the abundance of events show how campaigns are now casting a wider net. “Can you imagine you’re a Filipino auntie, and you’re just at [Seafood City Supermarket] to buy groceries, and then Bill Clinton shows up?” Jeng said. “They used to do this every election cycle, but now they also come with a lot earlier investments into the community.” Ana Wood, the director of the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce (LVACC), agreed this cycle feels extra busy. “[Politicians] are more involved,” Wood said. “They are more aware that the Asian vote matters.” For a voter bloc that has typically been ignored, in a self-enforcing cycle of low engagement, turnout and representation, the change is evident and invigorating. In just a few cycles, outreach has become more culturally specific, the AAPI percentage of the electorate hasgrownand the Legislature has seen an influx of Asian American members — all Democrats, at this point. Assemblywoman Erica Mosca (D-Las Vegas), a senior adviser on the Harris campaign in Nevada and the first Filipina American in the Legislature, remembered how excited she was in 2016 when Hillary Clinton’s campaign hosted a kamayan. “Back then, like you have one [event], and that was the Filipino outreach,” Mosca said. “Now it's a blitz all the time. There's always something.” “Not a monolith” The focus makes sense — Filipino Americans are the largest and fastest-growing segment of the AAPI population, estimated at 44 percent, according toAsian and Pacific Islander Vote(APIAVote). Next biggest is Chinese Americans, at about 14 percent, and then Japanese Americans at 7.5 percent. Native Hawaiians, Korean Americans, Asian Indian Americans and Vietnamese Americans each make up about 5 percent of the AAPI population. Though they trend Democratic, priorities and attitudes differ across ethnicity, age and immigration experience — 60 percent of the AAPI citizen population in Nevada was born in the U.S. According tonational datafrom the Pew Research Center, about two-thirds of Filipino, Korean and Indian Americans identify as Democrats, while Vietnamese Americans are more likely to be Republicans and Chinese Americans lean Democratic at slightly lower levels. Partisanship is highly correlated with age — nearly 90 percent of AAPI voters younger than 30 are Democrats, while Asian American seniors are close to an even partisan split. And U.S.-born Asian voters are far more likely to be Democrats than those born in a foreign country. “It's not a monolith,” Jeng said. “It's not the old stereotype of [the] model minority.” Some issues cut across ethnicity. Nearly everyone interviewed for this story identified the economy as the top issue for AAPI voters. Small-business policy is a chief interest for the vast array of AAPI small-business owners across the Las Vegas Valley. “All those [rising costs] affect the Asian businesses,” said Wood, whose organization has endorsed both candidates of both parties for the Legislature. “They're finding that they have financial challenges. And I'm not talking just about restaurants — I'm talking about even the spas, nail salons, dry cleaners.” Concerns about democracy are prevalent, particularly among immigrants who fled oppressive regimes and their children who grew up hearing about their parents’ experiences. Many AAPI voters are also troubled by the surge inhate crimesagainst Asian Americans that began during the pandemic, and Trump’srhetoric— including referring to COVID-19 as the “China flu” or “Chinese virus” — that helped fuel it. But outreach can look different depending on the group. Even though many older Filipinos, in particular, are devout Catholics and are personally anti-abortion, Mosca said Harris’ messaging strategy to frame abortion as a matter of freedom resonates. “Older folks … remember what it was like under [dictator Ferdinard] Marcos and they fled to come here,” Mosca said. “Under the Marcos regime, you did not have a choice either way.” Republicans believe that their military and Catholic backgrounds make Filipino Americans persuadable. Pauline Lee, the president of the Nevada Republican Club and a Chinese American, said she hopes to make inroads with Filipinos in the same way that Republicans have had success with Vietnamese and some Chinese Americans — raising concerns about communism, given the Philippines had an active insurgent communist movement. “Older Filipinos who came to this country are all conservative,” Lee said. “And they go to church.” That age divide can be consistent across ethnic groups as well. Caitlin Gatchalian, the chair of the Nevada AAPI Democrats, said she’s encouraging board members to talk to their parents about the election, and try to connect their immigration stories to Harris’ messaging on the “opportunity economy” — a key part of her appeal to Latino voters as well. Wood said she expects many AAPI voters, particularly the state’s growing number of nonpartisans, to be late deciders. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t paying attention. “Asians are very vigilant,” Wood said. “They want to make sure that the individuals that they are going to be voting for are well-educated [on the issues].” Democratic campaigns Numerous Democrats said the best thing that happened this cycle — up and down the ballot — was the ascension of Harris. It’s not just that she’s Asian American, they say, but that her campaign in Nevada is well-versed in cultural specificity. “With the Harris campaign, the outreach was happening organically,” said Gatchalian, noting that groups such as “Filipinos for Harris” and “Korean Americans for Harris” popped up without prodding from the AAPI Caucus. “[They know] this is a wave we should be riding.” Advocates acknowledge that more voter contact is necessary — only 44 percent of registered AAPI votersreportedcontact from Democrats in the 2022 midterm, compared to 35 percent among Republicans, per APIAVote. But AAPI voters’ Democratic lean, and the enthusiasm that staffers see in the community — one campaign official noted that they always get compliments when wearing their Harris-Walz gear in Asian grocery stores — means that the Harris campaign’s operation has been able to focus more on turnout rather than persuasion. This has resulted in a major emphasis on events and engagement with small businesses. The campaign itself has hosted numerous get out the vote events with surrogates at restaurants such as Chinatown Plaza’s Xiao Long Bao Dumplings and Chaska Indian Street Food. AAPI Democrats is hosting a silent disco Nov. 2, with free entry contingent on having canvassed for a Democratic candidate. One APIA Nevada has scheduled halo halo-ween, themed around the Filipino drink, and a Diwali celebration. Each cycle, AAPI voters get more familiar with interacting with their elected officials and engaging in electioneering. In the off years, groups such as Jeng’s have brought AAPI constituents to Carson City and Washington, D.C., to engage with the legislative process, which breeds more activity during the election season. “More and more community members are involved,” Jeng said. “That means more and more people are being able to pitch creative ideas that speak to their specific community, specific heritage.” On its PAC side, One APIA says it has also knocked on more than 170,000 doors, with a goal of hitting 200,000 — mostly on the southwest side of the Las Vegas Valley — and produced political videos themed like Korean dramas. The group has endorsed Harris, Rosen and Susie Lee, whose district is nearly one-fifth AAPI. While Jeng said neither presidential candidate has run away with the AAPI vote based on his interactions on the doors, he said he engages with more Harris supporters than those for Trump — but that many AAPI voters like to keep their decision close to the vest. Rosen, who has been particularly engaged with AAPI small-business owners throughout her term from her perch on the Small Business Committee, speaks about being the grandchild of immigrants, wanting a better life for the next generation and joining the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. Susie Lee’s outreach has ranged from ballot language access initiatives to tours of businesses in Chinatown. “With the AANHPI community, my background in education resonates very well,” said Susie Lee, who used to run an education nonprofit. “Choice is interesting. Older Filipinos tend to run a little more Catholic. I grew up Catholic, so I can have those conversations with them, that you can oppose it, but you can still allow women to make their own choices.” Jeng said the Democratic incumbents also have the advantage of years’ worth of interactions with the AANHPI community, from casework requests to community events. D’Silva said both Nevada senators and Susie Lee have been good at a critical element of AAPI voter outreach — just showing up, which fosters familiarity that drives turnout. “For a lot of immigrants, they want to not rock the boat too much,” said Chintan Desai, an Indian American and senior adviser to Assemblyman Duy Nguyen (D-Las Vegas). “But it is important to have our voices heard. Sen. Rosen being top of the ticket, being such an ally to the community here — the South Asian community in particular — is incredibly important.” Republican outreach The fact that Trump had an AAPI-themed rally — less than two weeks before the election — demonstrates the optimism Republicans have about the voter bloc. But it also revealed some of the roadblocks — outside of praising Filipino clothing, Trump had fewculturally specific pitches to offerand repeated the term “China virus.” Republicans have improved their AAPI outreach throughout the years. In 2016, APIAVote reported that 16 percent of Asian American voters reported contact from the Republican Party. By 2020, that figure hadgrownto 40 percent — significant, but still lagging Democrats. Republicanstoutedthe opening of their AAPI voter outreach center in Spring Valley in 2022; it quietlyshutteredand was replaced by a vape shop this year. But between concerns about small-business regulation, crime and high prices — in addition to partisan identity beingless stickyamong AAPI voters, Republicans believe several segments of the bloc are ripe for persuasion. The Trump campaign in Nevadahostsmonthly meetups for “Asian Americans for Trump” and has been tabling at the multitude of festivals, markets and cultural events that take place frequently across the Las Vegas Valley. Candidates such as Brown have made their pitch at the LVACC, and Trump, in polling, isbetter trustedon the economic issues that community leaders say are AAPI voters’ top concern. Wood said even if they’re not open about it, AAPI business owners are deeply concerned about prices — and it will likely affect how they vote. Pauline Lee, the Nevada Republican Club president, believes that younger AAPI voters will vote for Democrats because of their belief in abortion and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. But she thinks the economy will drive their parents toward Republicans — not necessarily because of their own economic circumstances, but because of frustration about their college-age or adult children’s struggles. Such struggles — even among those who went to prestigious universities — undermine the core immigrant belief that moving to America will provide your children with more opportunity — and make middle-aged AAPI voters open to the Republican message, she said. “The parents that I talk to are like, ‘What do you mean they don't have a job, right?’” she said. “And then they do get a job, and then the kids are saying to them, ‘But I can't afford housing.’” She added that affirmative action can also be a powerful motivator —Asian American plaintiffswere at the core of the successful court case to end affirmative action in college admissions. (Pew datashows that attitudes toward affirmative action among Asian Americans are mixed.) Pauline Lee and others have been running a get-out-the-vote operation, particularly hoping to appeal to the large swath of AAPI independents. She said Brown’s candidacy has been helpful in that respect, because he’s going where past Republicans have not. “What’s really clear is, Republicans have not, in the past, been very responsive to the AAPI community,” she said. “He’s saying look, your values are the Republican values.” Turnout AAPI organizers are cautiously optimistic that all of their effort will lead to higher turnout — “God, I sure hope so!” joked Jeng — and build on the gains between 2016 and 2020. Between the prior two presidential elections, AAPI voters, according todata from progressive firm Catalist, increased their number of votes by 45 percentage points in Nevada, 6 points higher than the national average. About 120,000 AAPI Nevadans voted, making theirturnout rateabout 57 percent. Using census tract data, Catalist estimated that Filipino, Vietnamese and Chinese Americans grew their vote share at rates larger than the national average. Given the explosion of registered nonpartisans in every community, modeling can be difficult, but organizers are hoping for higher voter turnout — regardless of who it benefits. “I would be very surprised if it's not [higher],” Mosca said. “People have been out there. People have been touched. People have been asked. It's on every airwave. It's in every restaurant. Politics in Nevada, it just becomes part of everyday life.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/at-listening-session-latinos-express-dissatisfaction-with-both-parties,True,"A handful of people trickled into the Las Vegas office of Latino advocacy group Make the Road Action Nevada on Tuesday night for a listening session on the 2024 election moderated by Radio Ambulante, NPR’s sole Spanish-language podcast. Colored pencils and papers were spread across the tables to doodle as participants listened to one of the series' latestepisodes on the Latino voteand discussed how those issues connected to their own lives. “Latinos need to vote and decide how we would like to be represented,” Etelvina Zamora-Esquivel, a 60-year-old phone banker for the progressive group said in reaction to the episode. For more than an hour, Zamora-Esquivel and the six other participants at the event moderated by Radio Ambulante’s Head of Communities Juan David Naranjo Navarro expressed wide-ranging grievances with the current state of affairs, from rising xenophobia to the economy and rising housing costs. While they expressed dissatisfaction with both parties, they demonstrated begrudging acceptance of Democrats, contending that they were less belligerent than anti-immigrant GOP candidates such as former President Donald Trump, who has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign if elected. Another factor that could help better Latinos’ political position, they argued: participation in local politics, from voting to getting elected themselves and just generally staying informed. The event was a much less formal affair than Vice President Kamala Harris’Univision town hallin Las Vegas two weeks ago, which had more than 75 attendees. Organizers for Radio Ambulante — who have hosted similar events in other swing states — said that they hoped that a smaller event would create a more comfortable, intimate setting for participants to share their thoughts about the contentious election. “[The listening clubs] are safe spaces, spaces where we accept differences, accept diversity and the life experiences of others,” Naranjo Navarro told theNevada Independent. Begrudging acceptance of Democrats Kenia Morales, 37, has come to favor Democrats, despite identifying as a nonpartisan and having a vocal distrust of the political establishment. “At the end of the day, I believe that if I am to have a conversation with a Democratic leader, it will help me more than with a Republican,” Morales said during the listening group. Like other Nevadans, the pandemic took an especially heavy economic toll on Morales. Her husband and brother lost their jobs. Meanwhile, her father’s photography business shriveled up, leading to a foreclosure on his house, leaving Morales — a self-employed political strategist who has led national campaigns — as the family’s sole breadwinner. “I remember thinking, ‘How am I going to pay all these bills?’” said Morales, who clarified after publication that she is a registered Democrat and her father’s house was not ultimately foreclosed upon. Despite Morales' economic struggles, she still believes that Democrats are the best pick this election, in part because she feels that the GOP has espoused anti-immigrant beliefs — to the point where she’s felt physically unsafe. She warned others, however, to remain politically active to ensure that elected representatives remained attuned to the community’s needs. Morales is not the sole Nevada Latino who has becomedisheartenedwith political institutions. Although the group comprises about 20 percent of Nevada’s registered voters, nearly half identify as nonpartisans, according to ananalysisfrom NALEO Education Fund, a Latino political group. Although Harris is currently outperforming Trump among Latinos,recent pollingshows that she is struggling to consolidate the same amount of support as President Joe Biden did with the group in 2020. To win Nevada, upping her support from the group may prove key. More Latinos needed in politics Yajaira Rimendes, a 34-year-old phone banker, has come to resent establishment political leaders who she says “don’t do anything to help Latinos.” After being diagnosed with cancer, Rimendes was briefly left jobless and even was homeless, and she says she was only able to get back on her feet with help from community organizations such as Make the Road Action. “That's why us Latinos are suffering now — because there are no representatives that support us,” Rimendes said. For Rimendes, who is originally from Puerto Rico, some of the discrimination she has experienced feels somewhat two-fold. After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in 2017, she says no politicians stepped in to help. And despite being from a U.S. territory, she’s frequently been told to “go back to her country” — something many others in the listening group reported experiencing. Although Nevada’s Latinopopulation has grown,its level of representation in elected office haslagged behind, anIndyanalysis found, despite bright spots such as the election of the nation’s first Latina Senator, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV.) In 2021,new redistricting boundariesdivided the Latino population across the state's four districts, diluting the voting bloc's power even more. But Leo Murrieta, the 38-year-old director of Make the Road Nevada, contends that upping Latino political representation isn’t enough. Pointing to the growing number ofLatino votersand politicians whofavor more stringent anti-immigration measures, he said the group also needs representatives — irrespective of race or ethnicity — who espouse Latinos’ best interests. “We need leadership, but we don't necessarily need politicians. We need people. We need tables like this with regular people who care about things,” Murrieta said. Updated on 10/29/2024 at 5:18 to clarify that the event was also coordinated by Make the Road Action. ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indyfest-2024-pollster-says-polarization-is-fueling-rising-distrust-in-government,True,"Pollster Steven Kull told those attending IndyFest 2024 that the public views elected officeholders as having “the most negatively regarded professions” due to the current state of political discourse in the U.S. Kull, director of the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland, toldNevada IndependentCEO and Editor Jon Ralston and reporter Gabby Birenbaum that mapping the left and right spectrum of Congress would form a U-shaped curve. “If you map the American public, it's a normal curve. Most people are kind of in the middle,” Kull said. “That’s why they find the political discourse frustrating. What’s the right balance?” He added that the public gets “worked up” because elected leaders have to make a choice but the process becomes frustrating to watch. Kull suggested creating more structures for elected leaders to engage and listen to their constituents. He said a study was done by his program to discover why Americans are unhappy with the government and why trust in elected leaders has declined. “There's a widespread perception that government is dominated by special interests, [which] does not serve the common good,” Kull said. “The people have very little influence and there's tremendous frustration. It goes to both parties. So what they're looking for is a way for them to have more of a voice.” Watch the full panel discussion here:",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/four-takeaways-from-trumps-aapi-voter-focused-rally-in-vegas,True,"Just days after early voting began and less than two weeks until Election Day, former President Donald Trump made his latest stop to Las Vegas on Thursday night, playing the hits of his standard stump speech — railing against undocumented immigrants, attacking Vice President Kamala Harris as radical and incompetent, bemoaning inflation, exalting tariffs, promising to slash taxes and prices and speaking about the election and his campaign in grandiose terms. The event, hosted by Turning Point Action, a student-focused conservative group, was geared toward Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) voters — the first Trump eventgearedtoward this bloc in Nevada this cycle. In the nearly 90-minute, wide-ranging speech at UNLV’s packed Thomas & Mack Center arena (it has a seatingcapacity of about 19,000), Trump attacked Harris and touted his tax policies. He briefly acknowledged the theme of the evening, saying he would build an economy that works for all Americans, including those of AAPI heritage, and noting he enjoyed the colors of Nevada’s Filipino Americans’ clothing. “[Filipinos] had the most beautiful clothing,” Trump said. “I said, ‘Where the hell do all these people come from?’ And when they told me, that’s why I put that little paragraph in there … you are the greatest people, hardest working, and we’re gonna take care of you. You’re gonna take care of us! What great spirit.” AANHPI voters make up about 11 percent of Nevada’s electorate. The fastest-growing demographic group in Nevada, they have traditionally supported Democratic candidates — in 2020, Biden won 64 percent of the Asian American vote to Trump’s 35 percent, perexit polls. But Republicans believe they can make inroads, especially on issues pertaining to the economy and small businesses. In 2022, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak won the AANHPI vote, but only by 8 percentage points, perexit polls. Democrats, of course, disagree. The Harris campaign has conducted AANHPI outreach for months, buoyed by key surrogates from the Legislature such as Assemblywoman Erica Mosca (D-Las Vegas), a senior adviser on the campaign. In a statement, Mosca ripped Trump’s presidency. “As president, Donald Trump oversaw a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes and fanned the flames with extreme rhetoric that put lives in danger and hurt Asian-owned small businesses,” she said. During the event, Trump repeated the phrase “China virus,” saying it’s what he called COVID-19, while telling attendees that he considered Chinese President Xi Jinping a friend until the pandemic. “We were actually very close,” Trump said. “But frankly, COVID — or as I call it, the China virus — was a step too far.” Studiessuggest that Trump’s 2020 use of phrases such as “China virus”contributedto that year’s rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and xenophobia. The Turning Point event included notable Asian American Trump surrogates, including former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is Indian American, and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), a Samoan American. “There is a very clear choice in this election,” said Gabbard, a former Democratic presidential candidate. “I am doing all that I can to help elect President Trump because there is nothing short of our freedom and our future on the line.” While the event featured numerous Asian American speakers — many wearing leis — advocates did not make culturally specific pitches to AAPI voters or acknowledge the evening’s theme beyond Gabbard saying hello in multiple Asian languages and Trump suggesting he might wear colorful Filipino clothing into the Oval Office. He briefly mentioned some Nevada-specific policy ideas, including opening up more federal land for housing and praising Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s leadership on the issue. He also suggested designating zones for large-scale housing construction, in which regulation and taxes are low. And he recognized Republican U.S. Senate candidate Sam Brown, who he said had “given up more to run for the United States Senate than any man in the history of” the upper chamber, likely in reference to him almost dying from burns during his military service. Nevada is squarely among the states whose electoral votes could determine the winner of the presidential race and control of the Senate. So far, Republicans have a steady lead over Democrats inearly voting— a fact that Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk touted at the rally. Here areThe Nevada Independent’smain takeaways: With Republicans holding a turnout lead about a week into Nevada’s early vote period, he mentioned numerous times how well he was doing — though he added that his advisers cautioned him against noting it, lest he depress turnout. “I’m not supposed to say it, but we are leading by so much,” he said. He and other speakers encouraged attendees to vote early. Trump gave a lengthy soliloquy about a wife dragging her husband off the couch to go vote for him. “Get your husband,” Trump said. “‘Hank, get the hell out of the couch, get up, get that big fat ass of yours, we’re gonna go vote for the president. We’re gonna turn our country around, Hank.’” Six days into early voting, registered Republicans in Nevada have a4-percentage-pointlead over Democrats with returned ballots — a reversal of typical trends, when Democrats usually build up a firewall. He also made multiple references to the conspiracy that Democrats stole the 2020 election — which hasbeencategoricallydisproven. He encouraged attendees to turn out and vote for him by such overwhelming numbers that “they won’t think about cheating as much.” Throughout the night, Trump reiterated his promise to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime pay and Social Security — the former which he first suggested in Las Vegas this June. He attacked Harris for promising to get rid of parts of his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which slashed the corporate income tax, and large chunks of which are set to expire in 2025. Currently, many of the personal and business deductions are set to expire in 2025, while the corporate tax rate cut Republicans passed is permanent unless changed again by Congress. He played several clips of Harris attacking the 2017 tax bill, promising to raise the corporate tax rate and her proposal to tax unrealized capital gains. Harris has also said she would end taxes on tips and promised to expand the child tax credit and create a tax credit for first-time homebuyers, among other proposals. He also said that “tariff” was the most beautiful word in the English language, before correcting himself and saying that “love” and “religion” were better. Trump haspledgeda 20 percent across-the-board tariff and a100 percent tariffon nations that shift away from the U.S. dollar. The former president also brought up an issue that has gotten less attention this election cycle — the environment. Trump, as is typical, railed against Democrats’ embrace of electric vehicles. He said that while he was not ideologically opposed to them — especially given that Tesla founder Elon Musk is a supporter and has appeared on the campaign trail with him — he also wants gas-powered and hybrid cars. Though the Biden administration hasnot proposed a banon gas-powered vehicles, Trump frequently says that Democrats have. Biden-era regulations have sethigherfuel economy targets for vehicles, which Trump has pledged to roll back. He also noted a break with former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who had joined forces with Trump on the campaign trail after dropping out of the race. Trump said that while he liked Kennedy’s views on health care — Kennedy frequently repeats misinformation about vaccines — he does not agree with his environmentalism. “I don’t know if I can have him working too much on the environment,” Trump said of Kennedy, an environmental lawyer. “I’m a little concerned about that with Bobby. I don’t know if I want him to play around with the liquid gold under our feet.” He also criticized Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and progressive Democrats’ embrace of theGreen New Deal, rejecting her2019 suggestionthat the world had 12 years to reverse the effects of global warming before the planet would be permanently destroyed. “Don’t worry about the environment,” he said. “It’ll be just fine.” He reiterated promises to increase American drilling for oil and gas and slash energy bills by 50 percent within a year. Trump made his usual refrains on immigration, promising to launch a mass deportation campaign and impose the death penalty to immigrants who kill U.S. citizens or law enforcement officers. But he added a new element to his stump speech: promising to enact the little-known1798 Alien Enemies Actif elected, which gives the president the authority to relocate, arrest or deport immigrants during wartime. “We are an occupied country,” Trump said. Despite the former president’s promise,recent pollingindicates that a bipartisan majority of Nevadans favor increasing legal pathways rather than mass deportation as a solution to illegal immigration.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indyfest-2024-forecasters-say-trumps-resilience-in-the-polls-makes-this-cycle-different,True,"For political watchers waiting for an “October surprise” in the 2024 presidential campaign, Amy Walter, publisher and editor ofThe Cook Political Report, had a message during IndyFest 2024. “It's like we've had an October surprise pretty much every month for the last four years,” Walter said, referring to a late-breaking news event that could reshape the race. “It has not really shifted the political affiliations or assessment of the candidates, which is quite phenomenal.” Walter and David Wasserman,Cook’s senior editor and elections analyst, joinedNevada IndependentCEO and Editor Jon Ralston and reporter Gabby Birenbaum for a discussion on the presidential race and the election in Nevada. Walter said the biggest change she’s noticed during the past year is that journalists, donors and strategists no longer underestimate the chances for former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. She said massive events haven’t moved the needle. That includes President Joe Biden being replaced at the top of the Democratic ticket by Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump’s federal indictments and conviction in a New York courtroomon 34 countsof attempting to illegally influence the 2016 election. “It’s important to appreciate that he's in a much better position politically,” Walter said, adding that Trump’s polling is better than “at any point in his three runs for office. So that part feels very different.” Wasserman said Southern Nevada's three congressional races haven't changed much, adding, “We can all assume that they're just going to end up 52-to-48 percent for the Democrats. [It] seems like the great immovable object.” In Nevada, he said Democrats want the presidential race to focus entirely on abortion and Republicans want to focus on the border and immigration. Nationwide, voters trust Trump more on the top issue — the economy. “But to these voters, it is a cost of living election,” Wasserman said. “By 55 percent to 26 percent margin, they favor Trump. They trust Trump more than Harris to rein in inflation. To me, that is one of the bigger warning signs for Harris.” Watch the full panel discussion here:",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/the-top-election-official-in-a-politically-crucial-nevada-county-says-she-was-forced-out,True,"By Christina A. Cassidy, Associated Press The top election official in one of the nation's most politically important counties said Wednesdayshe was forced out of her rolejust weeks before the November presidential election, disputing an official statement that she asked for a leave after experiencing ""stress issues."" The abrupt departure of Cari-Ann Burgessas the interim registrar of votersin northern Nevada's Washoe County one month ago is the latest sign of turmoil in a county that has been roiled for four years by people pushing election conspiracy theories. Washoe, which includes Reno, is a swing county in a state where this year's presidential contest is expected to be narrowly decided. Burgess toldThe Associated Pressin an interview that she had refused personnel changes sought by the county manager's office and had offered to step down and return to her prior position as deputy. She said she was told that was not possible. In a meeting with county staff, including representatives of the district attorney's office, Burgess said she was forced to put a request for leave in writing despite her desire to stay. ""I feel like I was absolutely forced out, but I have no idea how we got to this point,"" Burgess said in her first public remarks since her departure. ""Because the previous Friday and Monday, before I was put on leave, I was having high praises. They were like, 'You're doing a great job, you've got this, you're the best person for this job because you brought this team together.' ""And then all of a sudden, I was out on leave."" Burgess said she has hired a lawyer and was considering her legal options. In a Sept. 27 statement, Washoe County spokeswoman Bethany Drysdale said Burgess had ""experienced stress issues and requested medical leave."" Washoe County Manager Eric Brown told commissioners during an Oct. 8 meeting that Burgess was on leave and that she had not been fired and had not quit. George Guthrie, a spokesman for the county election office, on Wednesday reiterated the county's previous statement that Burgess had requested a leave and that the county was committed to ""running a smooth and fair election."" Nevada is one of seven presidential battleground states that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are hotly contesting ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election. Washoe is the state's second most populous county and is considered a bellwether because its elections are often narrowly decided and its vote can tip statewide elections. Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, has voted solidly Democratic in the past two presidential elections. A deputy filling in for Burgess is now the fifth person in four years to oversee elections in the politically mixed county. The staff has turned over entirely since the 2020 presidential election, Burgess said. A spokeswoman for the Nevada Secretary of State's Office declined to comment about the situation in Washoe County. Across the country, conspiracy theories and lies about the 2020 presidential election have created a difficult working environment for local election officials, who have faced harassment and even death threats. That has prompted election officials nationwide to prepare for what could be a tumultuous election, providing panic buttons for polling place supervisors and installing bulletproof glass at their offices. In Reno, county government meetings are often prolonged by members of the public who opposed Burgess' hiring as the interim registrar in January and who want the county to hand-count votes becausethey don't trust voting equipment. They also want election staff to do more to combat voter fraud, even though there is no evidence of any widespread fraud or manipulated voting equipment in 2020 or afterward. After the state primary earlier this year, the county commission's Republican majority voted 3-2 against certifying the results. They later reversed course, but Burgess said the initial vote hurt morale among her team at the election office. Commissioner Jeanne Herman, a Republican who has consistently voted against certifying election results since 2020, said news of Burgess' departure came as a surprise. Herman toldthe APWednesday that state GOP officials had met with Burgess for two hours to talk about their concerns shortly before Burgess went on leave. ""They came away thinking, 'Great, our election might just turn out OK,'"" she said. ""Then all of a sudden she was gone."" Burgess said the changes requested of her by county administrators involved assigning some election office staffers to a different department while keeping them working inside the office. ""I wouldn't have any say in what they were doing. And I said no to that,"" she said. She tried to return after being placed on leave, obtaining a doctor's note indicating she was fine to work, but county officials refused and told her the situation would be taken up after the presidential election. She said she has been forced to use her sick pay and vacation time, and was told not to contact her staff or speak with reporters. ""I wanted to stay and help this team,"" Burgess said. ""They have done so much and have done such amazing things in the last year that — yeah, I wanted to be part of it. And I wanted to help them, and they told me no.""

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/encouraged-by-early-voting-data-mcconnell-linked-group-to-drop-6-2-million-to-help-brown,True,"A super PAC linked to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is planning to make its first expenditure in the Nevada Senate race, less than two weeks before the election. Per reporting from NBC News, Senate Leadership Fund (SLF) isexpectedto make a $6.2 million ad buy to support Republican candidate Sam Brown. SLF had previously spent on Senate contests in Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but avoided the race in Nevada, where Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) has maintained a polling lead all cycle long. Polls have begun to tighten — Rosen’s recent leads have hovered around 4 percentage points or 5 percentage points, when she was routinely seeing double-digit leads earlier — andearly voting datalooks promising for Republicans, who have a turnout lead in the pre-election period for the first time since 2008. ""President Trump is doing very well in Nevada and we think Sam Brown can too,” SLF President Steven Law told NBC News. In another sign that Republicans are beginning to feel bullish about Nevada, National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) will be coming to the Silver State on Tuesday to make a last-minute campaign swing with Sam Brown, according to a source familiar with Daines’ travel. Even with SLF’s funding, Democrats have still spent nearly $25 million more than Republicans in the Nevada Senate race, between past and future reservations, according to AdImpact. Analysts and operatives believe Rosen’s early spending advantage — launching an advertising blitz in the spring, during the Republican primary — helped contribute to her consistent polling lead. And Senate Majority PAC (SMP), the Democratic counterpart to SLF that is linked to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), has been active in Nevada all cycle. In the final two weeks of the election, SMP isspending$8.3 million in Nevada, more than the group is spending in all but two swing states — a sign that they’re expecting a competitive race. “Mitch McConnell ignored Sam Brown for months,"" SMP spokesperson Hannah Menchhoff said in a statement. ""That he’s now coming in to try and appease the party elite, says more about Brown’s quality as a candidate than their actual belief he can win.” In 2022, Nevada was home to the closest Senate race in the country — Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) won by less than 1 percent of the vote. This story was updated at 2:00 p.m. on 10/24/24 to add comment from Senate Majority PAC.",Error: Connection error.

Judicial races are usually characterized by roadside signs saying nothing, fluffy TV ads and flashy mailers, with occasionally nasty campaigns, providing little illumination for voters who are mostly unfamiliar with the incumbents or challengers. This project aims to change that. Before I tell you more, an apology: I wanted to get this up before so many people had cast ballots. It is solely my fault and not that of a fantastic panel of lawyers who were willing to study background documents prepared by Boyd Law School students, whom I also am very grateful to for participating. I wanted to do more with the panel, too, fluffing them up with pictures and bios, but tempus fugit. Suffice it to say, they are a diverse group and they did not disappoint with their incisive, sometimes brutal assessments. My thanks to Dayvid Figler, Colby Williams, David Westbrook, Caleb Green, Todd Bice and Bailey Bortolin. They are all very busy lawyers, but they all believe this project is important. I also would be remiss if I didn’t thank CJ Keeney, our extraordinary chief technical officer, who has plenty of other things to do and took the time to make sure this was formatted correctly.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-asks-nevada-poll-observers-to-ensure-voting-machines-are-operating-accurately,True,"Republicans in Nevada are asking poll observers to complete a more than 15-item checklist on topics such as ensuring that voting machines are sufficiently secured and not connected to the internet, even though the poll watchers are not legally entitled to receive much of this information. Poll watching, which involves standing off to the side and ensuring that proper procedures are being followed while people go through the voting process, is a volunteer opportunity open to anyone who agrees to thestate’s rules. It’s especially common among Republicans and so-called voting rights groups. Thechecklist, obtained byThe Nevada Independent, instructs observers to contact the Nevada GOP’s Southern Nevada election integrity hotline if any of the items are not checked off. Lawyers and election integrity staff will respond to those reports, according to Claire Zunk, a Republican National Committee (RNC) spokesperson. In a statement Thursday, Zunk said the RNC “is fighting to secure the election, defending the law and promoting transparency and fairness for every legal vote” and accused Democrats of continuing “to interfere in our election and dismantle election safeguards.” The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office has found no evidence of widespread fraud in the past two election cycles, and the state’s voting machines undergo a rigorous testing process before, during and after elections. State law does not explicitly give observers the right to seek much of the information on the checklists, such as inspecting the security of voting machines, receiving the serial numbers of the machines and accessing voting data at a polling location. Because election workers are not obligated to provide much of this information to observers and have many other responsibilities, critics worry that not doing so could increase harassment of election workers. “I am very concerned that this could happen, in terms of them following these individuals and harassing them and creating an unsafe environment based on this information,” said Sadmira Ramic, a voting rights attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nevada. The issue is the latest GOP action that has prompted allegations that the party is attempting to sow doubt in the state’s election systems. Republicans have also launched a slew of lawsuits in Nevada (with no successes so far) that Democratssay fuel distrustof Nevada elections. Trump’s allies have alsocast doubton the security of voting machines. There are ahandfulof Nevada statutes that govern the actions of poll observers, such as allowing them to have access to“meaningful observation”of polling areas (such as watching people go through the voting process), but they are prohibited from speaking to voters, interfering in the voting process and objecting to a decision by an election employee. The RNC also has its ownrequirements, including not interacting with voters and being courteous, and anyone who violates them is out of the party’s program. Shelbie Swartz, the executive director of the progressive group Battle Born Progress, said her staff has seen instances during early voting in Southern Nevada of observers with these forms demanding the information from election workers. “Hassling and harassing election workers that are already taking time out of their lives to uphold our democratic processes is unnecessary and does nothing but attempt to sow distrust in our democracy,” Swartz said. Washoe County has not received any reports of issues related to the checklists, a spokesperson said. A GOP spokesperson from the national party’s election integrity unit also did not respond to criticism that the forms could invite election worker harassment or sow distrust in elections. Voting machines Many of the checklist items address electronic voting machines that were at the center of conspiracy theories in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. All but two counties in Nevada are using machines run by Dominion, the company at the center of the 2020 conspiracies that secured a $787 milliondefamation settlementwith Fox News. Lander County and Carson City are using theElection Solutions & Softwarevoting machines, which includes a paper record for every voter. The checklist asks poll observers to ensure that tamper proof materials have secured voting machines, memory cards and flash drives; note the serial numbers of all voting machines; verify that all machines and paper audit trail printers operated properly; and check if the machines had visible internet connectivity. Nevada election officials havemaintainedthat none of the state’s voting machines are connected to the internet, although online connectivity is among themany conspiracy theoriespushed by Republicans in 2020. Critics are concerned that poll watchers may not be qualified to actually check whether certain guidelines are being met. “It leaves open to interpretation of, like, what is considered visible internet connectivity?” Ramic said. “Some people are convinced that if there's any type of flash drive around, if there's any kind of wiring around, then it’s automatically connected to the internet.” The state has a process to ensure voting machines operate properly. Before a machine is allowed to be used in an election, officials appointed by the county or city clerk conduct testing that examines the system to ensure that it delivers the correct product, and any aspect with an error must be thoroughly investigated and pass testing to be accepted. Once a machine has been tested, it is brought into a “trusted” environment with limited access, logs auditing who accessed the machine and security seals to ensure the machine has not been tampered with. Additionally, before each election, the software on the machine must be examined to ensure it matches the approved software, and tests take place that ensure the machines accurately allow all candidates and questions to be voted on. Any error must be immediately reported to the Nevada secretary of state. In every step of the election process, the equipment is also routinely checked to ensure that nobody has gained unauthorized access, including examining security seals and randomly auditing whether the number of people who checked in to vote equals the number of ballots cast. Swartz from Battle Born Progress called these steps “robust safeguards.” “They are laying the groundwork to claim falsely that the voting machines are not reporting their votes accurately, which we know is untrue and an unsafe claim,” Swartz said. “I think it's very obvious, based off of that checklist, that that is the play that they're going to be making.” Updated on 10/24/24 at 8:53 a.m. to include information from an RNC spokesperson.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/three-takeaways-from-jd-vances-visit-to-nevada,True,"Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) returned to Nevada on Wednesday, holding events in Las Vegas and Reno, where he encouraged early voting and blamed an influx of undocumented immigrants for many of the problems facing Americans. In remarks lasting more than 30 minutes at Treasure Island and the Silver Legacy Resort, Vance condemned Vice President Kamala Harris’ continued support of President Joe Biden, slammed the rise in housing and grocery costs and criticized allowing transgender women to participate in women’s sports. He also took questions from reporters at both events. Asked byThe Nevada Independentwhether he and Trump would support eliminating so-called “junk fees” at resorts — as the Biden administrationhas supported— Vance said he and former President Donald Trump had not discussed the topic. The events marked Vance’s first appearance in the Silver Statesince late July, shortly after he joined the Republican ticket. Nevada is squarely among the battleground states likely to determine the results of the presidential race, and polls show the race to be a dead heat. Trump and Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) are also visiting the state in the coming days. Vance’s visit came on the fifth day of in-person early voting in Nevada. Early returns show registered Republicans have asignificant turnout advantageover registered Democrats, a rare phenomenon in Nevada that has prompted optimism from the GOP, whose leaders had previously disparaged early and mail voting. Here are key takeaways from Vance’s visit. Housing policies The start of Vance’s speech focused on Nevada’s affordable housing crisis, as the average home costhas risenabout $160,000 (a more than 50 percent increase) since 2019, and the state isestimatedto be short about 80,000 homes to meet the needs of the most low-income renters. Riffing on Trump's common phrase that the administration would ""drill, baby drill"" — usually a reference to expanding oil extraction and fracking — he said the Trump administration would work to build more houses, cut back on regulations hampering construction companies and free up federal land for housing development. The last point is particularly important in Nevada because the federal governmentowns about 86 percentof the land in the state, limiting its development and use. Trump and Harris haveexpressed supportfor freeing up the land for housing development. Vance said the land could also be protected and conserved, which is thecenter of legislationintroduced by Nevada’s congressional delegation and backed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. “There's a lot of land out there that isn't being used for anything, but it could be used for American homes for American citizens,” Vance said in Las Vegas. However, he also emphasized that housing development will not be beneficial as long as undocumented immigrants continue to enter the country, part of hisfrequent pushof the claim that they are responsible for higher housing costs. “It doesn't matter how many homes you build, my friends,” Vance said in Las Vegas. “If you let in millions upon millions of illegal aliens who shouldn't be here, we're not going to have enough homes for our people.” Housing expertshave saidthat it is not so simple. Although an increase in immigrants may contribute to asmall increasein housing costs, housing affordability has been a longstanding problem, largely dating back to a lack of new construction in the wake of the Great Recession. A homebuying rush during the pandemic compounded the issue. Immigration emphasis It wasn't only while discussing housing that Vance scapegoated immigrants. He said emergency wait times and access to hospital services are increasing because undocumented immigrants get free access to health care. Emergency rooms arenot allowedto turn people away based on their citizenship status, but undocumented immigrants facesignificant obstaclesin obtaining health care and are ineligible for federal health insurance subsidies. In his Reno rally, Vance also accused Harris of wanting to give undocumented immigrants access to Medicare. At a 2019 presidential debate, Harrisraised her handwhen asked if her health care plan would cover undocumented immigrants, but she has not said that she supports taxpayer funding for those benefits. He also added the children of undocumented immigrants are taking resources away from other students. “We've got thousands upon thousands of kids who are the children of illegal immigrants who are in our public schools in Nevada,” Vance said. “And of course, what happens when you've got teachers who've got to focus on kids who don't even speak English? That means that Nevada children are getting the short end of the stick and they're (not) getting the education they deserve.” The U.S. Constitution prohibits public schools from discriminating against students based on their immigration status. Vance also said he does not blame children who have been brought into the country illegally, and that instead the blame should rest with Harris. He also told the story of meeting with drug enforcement officials and learning that dangerous drugs have the appearance of candy. He said another Trump administration would continue building a wall at the southern border and deport undocumented immigrants (Trump has vowed to launch thelargest mass deportation operationin the nation’s history). Early voting encouragement Vance encouraged supporters to vote early or by mail, with the hopes of the GOP having a turnout lead before Election Day. “Let’s try to make as many votes by Election Day as possible,” Vance said. “Usually Republicans go into Election Day down thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of ballots. We have a chance in Nevada of going into Election Day with Republicans up by thousands of ballots.” It’s part of a GOP strategy this cycle to encourage early and mail voting after previouslydenigrating mail ballots as fraudulentand arguing voting should only last one day. Still, Trump hasgiven mixed messagingthis year on whether his supporters should vote that way. As of Wednesday morning, registered Republicans had a 12,000-vote turnout advantage over registered Democrats, though it is unclear whether that will result in Republicans hemorrhaging their typical Election Day voting advantage. Before Vance spoke in Las Vegas, Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald asked attendees to stand if they had voted early — and nearly everyone did so. McDonald also said he would be voting early for the first time in his life ""to make sure that my vote counts."" Glen Gulick of Gardnerville said he was also an early voter Tuesday, describing the process as “very smooth, very professional.” Standing outside the Silver Legacy Resort in Reno on Wednesday, he waved a Trump/Vance sign to passing drivers who responded with honks and cheers. Behind him, a woman waiting to enter the rally chanted “Trump, Trump, Trump!” “You might dislike Donald Trump, but you can’t dislike Vance,” Gulick said. “He’s so articulate, intelligent … that’s why we’re all here to see Vance. We support him as much as we support Donald.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-gaming-casinos-well-outside-city-limits-donating-to-vegas-mayor-candidates,True,"In pre-corporate Las Vegas, casino owners touted their perfect record in backing election winners. Were they channeling Nostradamus? No. They simply contributed financially to both candidates. We’re seeing that play out in the race for Las Vegas mayor. Also, analysts ponder The STRAT’s future. Pleaseclick hereto sign up forIndy Gaming. Some of the biggest campaign contributions to the two candidates squaring off to be the next Las Vegas mayor are from a casino located 11 miles outside the city limits. South Point Casino Resort is closer in proximity to Henderson than it is to Las Vegas City Hall. But that didn’t stop owner Michael Gaughan from embarking on an unwritten rule among old-school Las Vegas casino executives: donate to both candidates. Gaughan, through South Point, donated $10,000 — the maximum campaign contribution possible — to former Rep.Shelley Berkley(D-NV) and Las Vegas City CouncilwomanVictoria Seaman, according to campaign finance reports filed with the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office. “In the primary, I had my money on all three,” Gaughan said of the $7,500 donated to Councilman Cedric Crear, who finished third. “Shelley is a friend who I’ve known for years and I like Victoria,” he said. “The mayor is an important position.” Gaughan told of how decades ago, the late downtown casino owner Benny Binion headed into the Binion’s Horseshoe coffee shop for breakfast with his son, Jack Binion. It was the morning after an election and Benny was excited to tell Jack, “It was a good night. We backed all the winners.” Jack Binion quickly reminded his father they had backed the losers as well. “That’s how it was done. We always gave to both sides,” Gaughan said. Gaming companies have long been powerhouse donors to Nevada candidates up and down the ballot,including those in the Legislature. But why donate to both candidates running in a jurisdiction that has no control over the South Point? Observers say it’s because decisions made in city hall go well beyond the city limits. “Everybody thinks the Las Vegas Strip is in the city,” said Gaughan, who has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars throughout the years to local, state and federal candidates. Sahara Avenue is the city-county boundary line with all gaming properties to the north within the city. The northernmost Strip resort is the Sahara, which is in the county. In July, to clarify the jurisdiction, Clark County Commission Chairman Tick Segerblom suggested aname change— Las Vegas County. So far, no one else on the board has seconded the idea. Gaughan isn’t the only casino operator to donate to the mayoral candidates. Berkley, who spent 14 years in Congress representing Las Vegas, raised more than $858,000 through the end of September, which included $67,500 from casino operators and others associated with gaming — the state’s largest industry. She received $10,000 from Circa Casino Resort owner Derek Stevens, $10,000 from STRAT owner Golden Entertainment — the STRAT is north of Sahara Avenue — and $5,000 each from Station Casinos and the company’s Santa Fe Station Casino, which is in the city limits. Boyd Gaming, which operates three downtown casinos, donated $5,000 to Berkley’s campaign. Berkley also received $5,000 from Wynn Resorts, and $1,000 each from former MGM Resorts CEO Jim Murren, Full House Resorts CEO Dan Lee and former Boyd CEO Don Snyder. James Nave, a board member of Station Casinos’ parent Red Rock Resorts, donated $5,000 to Berkley. Seaman raised more than $587,000 through the end of September, which included $52,000 from gaming and other entertainment businesses. Golden Entertainment contributed $7,500 to Seaman while Station Casinos donated $5,000 and the company’s Palace Station donated $10,000. Boyd Gaming’s Suncoast donated $5,000. Palace Station and Suncoast are in the city. Tim Herbst, CEO of slot machine route operator Jett Gaming, donated $10,000 to Seaman. She also raised $5,000 from a company controlled by UFC President Dana White and $2,000 from Gold & Silver Pawn, the downtown store featured on the television seriesPawn Stars. Gaming industry consultant Brendan Bussmann, managing partner of Las Vegas-based B2 Global, said casino operators have relationships with candidates that often span decades. “You have communitywide issues that affect gaming across the board,” Bussmann said. “Southern Nevada has various government entities that all have to play nicely in the sandbox. The Strip may start in the county south of Sahara [but] issues that are of concern to everyone go north of that border.” In interviews, Berkley and Seaman said the world outside of Southern Nevada doesn’t realize the Las Vegas mayor isn’t in charge of the Strip. The Goodmans — former Mayor Oscar Goodman and his wife, current Mayor Carolyn Goodman — spent 25 years trying to change that perception. Both Goodmans lobbied to bring professional sports to Las Vegas, only to see Allegiant Stadium built in unincorporated Clark County across Interstate 15 from the Mandalay Bay — not to replace the city’s aging Cashman Field. “What’s good for the community is good for all of Southern Nevada,” Berkley said. Analysts speculate on a potential REIT deal for the STRAT Could Golden Entertainment be contemplating selling the STRAT Hotel, Casino & Tower? CBRE Equity gaming analyst John DeCree wrote in an Oct. 18 research note that the STRAT has not seen its hotel occupancy rates increase following the closures of The Mirage and Tropicana Las Vegas. Following meetings with company executives during the recent Global Gaming Expo, analysts speculated the downtown resort could be the target of a real estate investment trust (REIT), which could buy it and lease it back to Golden. Golden soldits Maryland casinoand its slot route operations inNevada and Montanaduring the past year. The company operates three casinos in Las Vegas, two casinos in Laughlin, three casinos in Pahrump and a Nevada tavern business with 70 locations operating under eight brands. “Golden is well positioned to be involved in [merger and acquisitions] as either a buyer or seller,” DeCree wrote, although he speculated the company would “be patient for something transformative.” Deutsche Bank gaming analyst Carlo Santarelli offered a similar sentiment, writing in an Oct. 17 research note the speculation is simmering about a “strategic action” involving the company. The 2,400-room STRAT and its 1,149-foot tower sit on 67 acres just north of the Strip. On the company’s quarterly earnings call in August, CEO Blake Sartini said the company would analyze any potential REIT opportunity. “I think the question for us is how do we generate the most value. Is it owning our real estate or not? We go through that constantly,” Sartini said on the company’s Aug. 9 quarterly earning conference call. VICI Properties, the gaming industry’s largest real estate investment trust, has made no secret of its interest in downtown. The company owns 10 properties on the Strip, including Caesars Palace, the Venetian-Palazzo complex and six properties operated by MGM Resorts International. VICI CFO David Kieske said followinga 2023 presentationat Preview Las Vegas that the company was seeking sale-leaseback opportunities with downtown casino resorts and in the neighborhood casino market. VICI President John Payne made similar remarks in a2021 interviewwithThe Nevada Independent. “The city has been redeveloping downtown. So we would welcome the opportunity to own real estate and buildings if there ever comes a time to do that,” he said. 🏨MGM and Marriott plan to covert the Delano property to the W Hotels brand— Clark Schultz,Seeking Alpha MGM Resorts International and Marriott Bonvoy have had a partnership since March that benefits each company’s customer loyalty program. ♠️♥️♣️♦️Archie Karas, a gambling legend who made—and lost—a fortune, dies at 73— Jon Mooallem,The Wall Street Journal Archie Karas was a fixture in Las Vegas poker rooms untilhe was placed onNevada’s List of Excluded Persons in 2015. 💲With supermajority at stake, fundraising battle is tight in key Nevada legislative races— Eric Neugeboren,The Nevada Independent Oakland Athletics owner John Fisher gave $10,000 to a Republican challenging a Democratic senator who voted against the public financing bill to bring his team to Las Vegas. 🏝️New Sphere venue coming to Abu Dhabi, UAE, matching capacity of Las Vegas arena— Anthony Robledo,USA TODAY Building costs for Sphere in Las Vegas hit $2.3 billion — the highest price for any non-gaming entertainment venue.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/what-made-sam-brown-run-again,True,"In 2010, two years into a painful recovery process from the burns that consumed 30 percent of his body, sustained in an explosion while deployed in Afghanistan, Sam Brown first visited Nevada. It was November, and his wife, Amy, had received a four-day weekend military pass. Eager to explore, the Texas residents booked a trip to Reno to hike around Lake Tahoe. The trip could have been a disaster. Novices to hiking and the region’s wildlife, they carried dog treats for their dog Leonidas that was with them — and when they heard the telltale growling of a nearby bear, they ran 2 miles back to their car. Brown found the experience funny, and the natural beauty of Lake Tahoe vivid and memorable. Through another year of intensive physical therapy, various career starts, a political run and business school, the region remained on his mind. “Something about the place felt spacious and expansive — it felt easier to dream here,” he wrote in his 2024 memoirAlive Day. That love of hiking — and an interest in Nevada’s small-business-friendly climate — drove the Browns to move to Reno in 2018, he said. As a love of the outdoors blossomed in the years after the devastating injuries that abruptly cut his military career short, so too did his interest in politics — that would ultimately launch him into one of the country’s most competitive Senate races. Brown, who medically retired from the Army in 2011 with the rank of captain, first explored running for office in a failed 2014 legislative bid in Texas. Disgusted by the world of political consulting and feeling unmoored in his career, he vowed to never run again. But by 2021, he announced a bid for U.S. Senate in his new home state, ultimately losing to former Attorney General Adam Laxalt in the primary. Running for the third time, Brown became the early GOP favorite this cycle, backed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), and easily won the Republican primary in June, setting up a general election showdown with Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV). In Nevada political circles, there’s some skepticism about a relatively new Nevadan attempting to make the jump to the U.S. Senate without having held an elective office — and some observers suggest he should have started with a smaller race. “There were a lot of concerns from the start that he didn’t have the substance or depth of knowledge of the state of Nevada,” Amy Tarkanian, a former Nevada GOP chair, said. Brown, when asked atIndyFestwhy he didn’t start smaller, said that his wife challenged him in the months after the inauguration of President Joe Biden to be a leader — and he identified the U.S. Senate as the area of greatest need. (That account is somewhat rebutted byreportsthat he explored a run for the Legislature in 2020 — a Nevada political consultant with knowledge of the race said he was talked out of it after learning the race he was targeting was unwinnable for a Republican, while the campaign says local consultants tried to recruit him, but he did not seriously consider it.) Politicos who know Brown laugh at the Democratic insinuation that he’s an also-ran who moved to Nevada for a political future. (“It’s funny when I hear people say he moved into Nevada to run for office,” said a Republican political consultant who has worked with Brown. “If you’re a Republican, stay in Texas.”) But his desire to represent Nevadans — to be a politician — was formed even before he arrived, in the destabilizing tribulations of a military leader with a belief in service whose near-death experience in Afghanistan left him without a constituency to guide and a conviction that his life has divine purpose. “I have needed to be helped by so many people,” Brown said in an interview. “I literally had a number of months where I couldn’t feed myself. I couldn’t change my bandages. I couldn’t even drive anywhere. And so going from a place of total dependence on other people’s love, grace, [and] leadership — that I see reflected in my faith — is how I attempt to try and love, serve, lead and sacrifice for others.” On the trail Brown sees representing Nevadans as his new mission. He tells the story of his injury and recovery as a testimony about hope. Brown speaks about politics in much the same way — the American dream, as he tells it, is becoming increasingly out of reach. A surprise medical bill or home repair is enough to put the dream out of reach; political leaders, then, should fight for the restoration of hope. It’s a message, ironically, somewhat reminiscent of Elizabeth Warren or Barack Obama, whose magnetism his staff compares him to — complicated significantly by his trailing in the polls and embrace of the former president, whose agenda Brown says would be his firstpriorityin the Senate. Those who know him describe Brown as warm, a listener, an avid reader with a dry sense of humor. “Even though he believes in MAGA policies, very much like (former President Donald) Trump and (Sen. JD) Vance, he definitely has a different personality,” said Pauline Lee, a former Nevada Republican Club chair who first met Brown in the 2022 cycle and is conducting outreach on his behalf in Las Vegas. “He's very laid back. And most importantly, I think he really is very good at listening to people.” David Duffield, a tech billionaire who lives in Incline Village,gavea super PAC supporting Brown $2 million last year. Through a spokesperson, he said Brown’s honest character, compassion and political outsider status impressed him. And yet a combination of persistent Democratic attacks, a nearly 3.5-to-1 spending disparity between Rosen and Brown and his embrace of Trump — who, it should be noted, is outperforming him in the polls and has a 50-50 shot of winning the state — have perhaps rendered those stylistic differences moot. Brown is trying to run a different type of Republican campaign than past candidates, actively targeting Latino, Asian American and rank-and-file union members at community events with local leaders and pop-ups. “In studying campaigns and politics here over a couple of cycles, I thought that Republicans had left some meat on the bone with Hispanic voters,” Brown said. “What I have seen in the past is kind of a check-the-box effort on outreach with folks who really want to build a relationship.” At the same time, like the past two Republicans who have run and lost for Senate in Nevada, he’sclung tightlyto Trump, appearing at rallies and events, following his lead on policy and highlighting their alliance in campaign materials. The increasingly blurred lines between the Trump playbook and the Brown campaign has some Nevada Republicans worried, wondering if he should emphasize Nevada-specific issues, his humor and relatability — Brown is a millennial, parent of three school-age kids, lives in a three-bedroom home in Reno and, with a net worth under $1 million, would be one of the least wealthy senators if elected — rather than national themes. They fear the campaign has gotten too negative and partisan, potentially turning off independents or crossover-curious voters. “He's gone overboard in kissing the ring,” said Tarkanian. “It's painfully obvious. You still have a lot of voters, especially in Nevada, who aredouble hatervoters — I’m one of them. So I don't want to hear you fawning.” The campaign insists Brown has a distinct brand, and believes it’s connecting. While he may not talk about it on the trail, Brown says he is interested in bipartisanship — especially because if elected, he’ll have to work with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), who he would have faced in 2022 if he won the Republican primary. “I don’t have to wear it on my sleeve,” Brown said. “The reality is, Sen. Cortez Masto and I have each other’s phone numbers. I actually texted her after the debate.” But Democrats feel confident about the race, in large part because of their significant financial advantages and a number of messaging opportunities they think Brown has provided them with — anunforced erroron Yucca Mountain, his shifts onabortion, past support fordrastic cutsto federal departments andplaying footsiewithelection denialism, among them. (AtIndyFest, Brown confirmed that he believes Biden is the duly elected president and that the 2020 election was fair.) Nevada Democrats have launched a “Too MAGA for Nevada” messaging campaign against him and the Rosen campaign got out to a quick start on the airwaves, defining him as extreme on abortion. Rosen ran her first general election ad in early April; Brown spent the spring fending off primary challengers, parrying attacks about his MAGA bona fides and trying to earn a Trump endorsement that eventually came in the eleventh hour. Democrats have highlighted his record on abortion to great effect all year, releasing ads featuring a womanforcedto flee Texas in order to abort a fetus who doctors said would not survive, among others, with an overarching theme of portraying Brown as too extreme for Nevada, a state where a majority of voters support abortion rights. Brown’s opinion hasshiftedduring his political career, from supporting a 20-week ban in Texas, where a majority of voters oppose abortion rights, to filing out a campaign questionnaire in 2022 saying he did not support abortion even in cases of rape, incest or threat to the life of the mother (which he said was filled out erroneously by a staffer), to saying he supported exceptions to ultimately coming out against a national ban. In audioobtainedbyThe Nevada Independent,Brown said he would not vote for a ballot question to enshrine abortion protections in the state’s Constitution. He’sreleasedhis own ads stating his opposition to a national ban — and said atIndyFestthat he told Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who proposed a 15-week abortion ban, that he would not vote for such a bill — but Rosen’s ad onslaught has been persistent and better funded. Aninternal polling memofrom a Republican super PAC obtained byPoliticonoted that Democrats were winning on abortion — and in the race. The early October poll found Brown down 7 percentage points. “Sam Brown has struggled to close the gap in this race, largely due to nonstop ads savaging him on abortion,” wrote Steven Law, the group’s president. “ In a crowded cycle, where national Republican groups’ attention — and resources — are being pulled in numerous directions, including red states such as Ohio and Montana and swing states that look closer, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, one strategist with knowledge of the race said Brown’s campaign has not been impressive enough to warrant the level of investment needed to compete with Rosen. Bullish at the beginning of the cycle based on the state’s transience, economic struggles and Rosen’s relatively low name identification for an incumbent, Republicans now grouse that Brown’s political novice status was always apparent. “He’s done this multiple times,” the strategist, given anonymity to speak candidly, said. “He’s not built for politics, is the honest truth. “[The NRSC] screwed up, because [chairman Sen.] Steve Daines (R-MT) rode around with him on a bus and thought he was a cool guy, and they were like, “Oh, this is the guy’,” the strategist continued. “They don’t think that anymore. They know he’s not a good candidate.” NRSC communications director Mike Berg rebuts that narrative, saying that “Sam Brown has begun rapidly closing the gap with Jacky Rosen now that he is more heavily advertising on TV.” Paul Snow, a canvasser with Teamsters 986, has been door-knocking for Democrats in Las Vegas since late September. In that time, he said he’s only seen one Brown canvasser. He has encountered split ticket voters, including those who have Trump paraphernalia at their house but have pledged to vote for Rosen — and disparage Brown. “One voter said, ‘I’m voting for Trump,” Snow said. “I asked about Rosen. He said, ‘She’s the one running againstScam Brown, right?’” ‘Browns serve’ The oldest of five children, Brown was born in 1983 near the town of Conway in rural central Arkansas. His father served in the military, and Brown knew early on that he wanted to as well, poring over recruitment brochures and cherishing a souvenir First Infantry Division coin he had picked up on a family road trip. Their family mantra was “Browns serve” and the military remained his prevailing focus as a young adult. Brown said he knew his parents were Republicans, and that his earliest political experience was seeing President Ronald Reagan from his kitchen countertop television as a kid. Single-minded in his pursuits, Brown attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. He had always thought of himself as a leader, and the military gave him an opportunity to build that skill. During infantry officer training at Fort Benning, he got word that he would be deploying to Afghanistan. The best-known part of his story — the chapter whose scars he bears — comes next. As a platoon leader in Kandahar, Brown’s humvee was hit by an improvised explosive device. Ejected from his vehicle, Brown furiously attempted to put out the flames engulfing his body and had the terrifying realization that he was going to burn alive. In the moment of certainty that his death was imminent, Brown wrote in his book that he realized he had fallen short as a Christian — that although he grew up going to church, his life had been in service to himself rather than God. Even before his physical salvation, he accepted a spiritual one — that whatever came next in his life was divinely authored, that his purpose was to serve the Lord. His life was forever changed by the spiritual reckoning that moment brought, the permanent damage done and the voice of his gunner who rescued him from the flames: “Sir, I’ve got you.” His painful, harrowing rehabilitation experience — a three-year physical therapy journey — waswell-documentedin a 2012 GQ article. Brown met his wife, Amy, while she was serving as a dietician in the burn unit. Those who know the Browns speak of them as a unit — partners in each decision. In another well-chronicled piece of their history, Sam met Amy in the weeks after she had an abortion — a decision she said she felt pressured into making quickly. “I thought I had chosen freedom, but I did not feel free,” she wrote in her chapter of the memoir. With his help, she rediscovered her faith and belief in the power of divine forgiveness. The couple opened up in aninterviewwith NBC News during the primary about her abortion. Finally, the injury and Brown’s subsequent medical retirement from the Army displaced his fundamental sense of self. He had achieved the rank of captain and made returning to Afghanistan a goal throughout his rehab — only to learn it would not be possible. “Who was I supposed to be, if not a leader?” Brown wrote in his book. “What was I supposed to do now, if not serve?” The arc of his career since then has been in service to that question. Business experience After recovering at the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Brown rediscovered some of his old passion in stepping up to encourage fellow veterans in their recovery. In 2011, he met former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach, who told him he was starting up a nonprofit organization to help veterans in North Texas and wanted Brown to join the team. Seemingly a fit, Brown said he found himself disillusioned and feeling like a charity case. During his recovery, his mother had given him a Purple Heart hat to wear by way of explanation for his facial wounds in public; Brown felt this only invited pity and stopped wearing it. He left the nonprofit circuit and tried out management consulting, launching a global logistics business called Pruitt, Winston & Brothers in 2012 with a fellow veteran. “I remember it just being sort of this abrupt moment where suddenly now I'm out of the military, and had no kind of on-ramp to life after that,” he said. “I think that parallels a lot of adult life.” In Texas, he and Amy had done some political volunteering with local groups; in 2014, he was approached by political consultants he had met about exploring a run for Texas House. He got somesplashy pressand proved adept at attracting donors, but ultimatelyfinished third. Brown wrote he felt used by the political consultants who had encouraged him to run, nothing more than a Wounded Warrior meal ticket. While it may not have been a success for him, his Texas House run proved fertile opposition ground for Nevada Democrats, who have gotten tons of ad mileage out of hissupportof a Texas law banning abortion after 20 weeks, when he called “issues of life” a “nonnegotiable” for him. Brown did some political consulting in the following years, includingmanaging an unsuccessful campaignfor fellow Texas veteran and West Point classmate Sam Deen in 2018. In 2015, deciding he needed more training, he enrolled in business school at Southern Methodist University while working at a title company. After earning an MBA, Brown — who had been promised a role at a private equity management firm only to see the mentor who had offered him the job leave due to health issues — decided to move to Nevada. He looked for roles at Amazon fulfillment centers and took a job as an operations manager at a warehouse in Reno. In his book, he wrote that though he felt he was overqualified for the job, he enjoyed leading a team again and having identifiable goals to meet. But he found Amazon itself frustrating, treating employees as expendable in its never-ending pursuit of quotas. Attempting to help his employees struggling to make enough, he saw government aid as “temporary or insufficient, which gets people stuck waiting on the government’s aid — even though it’s not enough.” Throughout this period, he also volunteered on local races, including door-knocking for the Trump campaign in 2020. In the meantime, Brown began exploring starting a small business. He had registered Palisade Strategies, a pharmacy benefit management firm connecting Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers with pharmaceutical companies, in Texas in 2012. In 2018, the year he moved to Nevada, Palisade entered a mentor-protégé agreement with Heritage Health Solutions, a larger health care logistics company. Brown’s status as a service-disabled veteran made the business eligible to compete for set-aside government contracts; between 2020 and 2021, before Brown ultimately sold the business to an executive at Heritage Health, the company wasawarded$2.7 million in federal contracts. Brown said the experience was rewarding — a way to “stand in the gap” between the VA and emergency medication needs. He described one case where a veteran needed a specialty compound medication, but the reimbursement rate was lower than the cost of the material needed to create the solution, so the pharmacy decided not to do it. Brown said he decided to pay the cost so the veteran could get the medication. He later learned the client had been at risk of permanent blindness. “I was proud to be able to provide that service, in pursuit of my own version of the American dream,” he said. Pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts and CVS Caremark havecome under scrutinyfrom both parties in Congress as targets for reform regarding allegations that they inflate drug prices; the Federal Trade Commissionconcludedin a report that they drive costs up and reduce consumer choice. Brown argued that overregulation contributes to high costs, but agreed reform is needed — he called for eliminating rebates from pharmacy benefit managers to providers, a bridge further than the prevailing proposal in Congress and one backed byantitrust think tanksand more populist Republicans. None of Brown’s business associates contacted byThe Nevada Independentfor this story responded to interview requests. Politics, again In his book, Brown writes that he began to think about trying politics again on a hike with his wife and children, when Amy asked if he felt like he was living out the purpose for which God had saved him in Afghanistan. Brown writes that he did feel content, and when political consultants came calling again about a potential run, he entertained them at his house with the hope that Amy would be the bad guy and shoot down the idea. Instead, she told him that she had come to the same conclusion in prayer as the consultants — that God felt they were wasting their time, that the Browns were made for more than hiking and that a leader like him was needed in politics. That conversation has led him to three years on the campaign trail. It also underscores the centrality of Amy’s role — a partner who the campaign considers a key asset. “Not only is Sam such an incredible man in his own right, he has got a wife, Amy, who is caring, considerate, just absolutely fantastic,” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), who campaigned for Brown with Amy in Las Vegas in September. “She is on the trail for Sam and doing really good things with the women demographic.” Amy has hosted events up and down the state and been featured in fundraising blasts, particularly those targeting parents. In October, the campaign cut anadwith her speaking directly to the camera about her abortion. The Browns homeschool their kids — “I’m a Bible-believing momma who puts Bible lessons in our family’s homeschool curriculum,” one fundraising email signed by Amy reads — and Sam calls his kids every night from the campaign trail to lead them in prayer. Republicans also think Brown’s story will resonate with voters — he used his time on stage at the Republican National Convention to share his experience in Afghanistan and recovery, and connect it to the theme of hope that he’s tried to center on the campaign trail. “It's a great American kind of warrior hero story,” said Daines, the NRSC chairman. “And I think it'd be a compelling story for ‘24.” People who have worked on his campaigns — past and present — say Brown is magnetic in person. They believe the energy they see in rooms on the campaign trail has not been reflected in polling, and that the race is closer than the margins indicate. Staff say he feels compelled by a sense of duty — the same mission-bound responsibility he felt in the military — to run for office, rather than any interest in personal gain or desire for power. (Democrats, of course, note that this is his third run for office — and he’s spent a lot of time online and on the trail in recent months promoting his book.) “He's just a people person,” a staffer said. “He's very relational. If there's a person in the office, he knows that person's name. If it's a volunteer, whoever it is, he's going up, he's talking to them. He's telling me about their story. That's why he's attracted such a loyal following of staffers.” As an example, one staffer said Brown found himself on a flight with then-Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) last cycle, and switched seats in order to sit next to him. They spent the flight chatting, and by the end, the staffer said Sisolak told Brown that he would win the state if every voter could spend five minutes talking to him. (According to a former Sisolak aide, the two did sit next to each other on a plane, but Sisolak never said anything of the sort.) On policy Staff say Brown’s main focus is economic policy — proposals include ending taxation on tips and Social Security benefits, opening up more federal land for housing, lowering taxes and cutting government spending and regulations. His overall approach is standard GOP orthodoxy — less government. “The Democrat Party sort of represents an intrusion and additional involvement in people's lives that tends toward higher taxes, more regulations, just less freedom at the end of the day,” he said. “I aligned myself with a party that believed in smaller government, and individual freedoms and allowed people to pursue a life of the American dream.” He has a particular interest in energy policy, which is spurred by a belief that federal investment in renewable energy is the wrong approach. As a lover of the outdoors, he said he is concerned by the Bureau of Land Management’splanto designate as much as 12 million acres of federal land for utility-scale solar development. “Our family’s a very avid outdoors family,” he said. “I don’t want to see 12 million acres covered with solar panels or highly reflective metals. That’s going to destroy part of the beauty (of) what makes Nevada attractive.” Brown is also a strong backer of the cryptocurrency industry, saying that Democrats, including Rosen, prefer the banking system in order to spy on Americans’ bank accounts via the Internal Revenue Service, and that crypto offers privacy and security — and needs to be protected from government regulation. And he said he also believes that Nevada needs a more aggressive approach in Colorado River water negotiations, wanting to be a federal voice calling for greater accountability for California rather than increased conservation efforts in Nevada. The prevailing thread in his ambitions — from the military to the campaign — has been a conviction in his leadership abilities. It’s the quality that draws staff to him, making him an inspiring figure, and frustrates some in the Nevada political class, presenting as an arrogance about his role in the state he’s called home for six years. Above all, it’s why he’s running. “Our country needs people who can stand up and lead on behalf of all of us,” Brown said. “[The Senate] was where there was maybe the highest need. And so that’s where we jumped in.” This story was updated at 5:30 a.m. on 10/23/24 to include comment from the NRSC.It was updated against at 6:30 a.m. to reflect the current spending disparity between Brown and Rosen.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indyfest-2024-pollster-and-sandoval-optimistic-that-voting-in-nevada-will-go-smoothly,True,"Nevadans are confident their votes will be counted accurately in the general election, Republican pollster Dave Sackett said in the opening panel Friday at IndyFest 2024. Sackett, a founding partner of The Tarrance Group, and UNR President Brian Sandoval discussed “Polling and Democracy” withNevada IndependentCEO and Editor Jon Ralston and reporter Eric Neugeboren atThe Indy’s annual conference. Sackett said the polling found that Nevadans don’t believe the perceived threats that have risen nationally have anything to do with the state’s election system. Sandoval, a Republican former governor who is co-chairing theDemocracy Defense Projectin the state, said a dose of skepticism by voters means they are engaged in the process and doing their homework. ""I'm always optimistic,” Sandoval said. “I think this is a great opportunity we have this election cycle.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/for-second-time-judge-dismisses-gop-lawsuit-challenging-nevada-voter-rolls,True,"For the second time this year, a federal judge has dismissed a Republican-led lawsuit that accused Nevada officials of improperly maintaining the state’s voter rolls, adding to the litany of GOP defeats in court this cycle. In arulingissued Friday afternoon, Judge Cristina Silva determined that the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Nevada Republican Party had again failed to establish standing while arguing that high voter registration rates in five Nevada counties had harmed their overall mission and campaign activities. She will, however, allow the GOP to file an amended lawsuit, as she did in herJune dismissalof the first iteration of the lawsuit. The lawsuit is the latest legal defeat for the RNC and Nevada GOP, which have filed a slew of lawsuits in Nevada this year related to voter rolls and mail ballot procedures. Republicans have not succeeded in any of their Nevada lawsuits this year, but some of the cases are in various stages of appeal. Democratshave arguedthat the GOP is pursuing long-shot lawsuits to sow distrust in election systems, while Republicans say they are necessary measures to rebuild faith in elections. In a statement, an RNC spokesperson said the group plans to amend the lawsuit. “We continue to fight for clean voter rolls in Nevada to ensure a fair and secure election,” the statement said. “The judge did not rule on the merits of the case or suggest that Nevada is properly maintaining its voter rolls in accordance with the law.” This legal battle began in March when the GOP groups, alongside Washoe County resident Scott Johnston, filed alawsuitthat argued five Nevada counties had “impossibly high” voter registration rates in violation of federal elections law. State elections officials, meanwhile, said the allegations were meritless and based on a flawed comparison of two datasets that it described as “comparing apples to orangutans. The two datasets were the Census Population Survey — a Census poll that the state says is an unreliable source for voter registration — and the Census’ annual data collection of the American voting age population. Silva dismissed this suit in June, ruling that the GOP had failed to establish standing and the timing of the lawsuit did not offer the state an opportunity to immediately solve the alleged problem because of federal restrictions on changing voter rolls before elections. In July, Republicans filed an updated lawsuit that further elaborated how they have been harmed. They argued that false voter registration data imperils the party’s ability to form winning campaign strategies, causes the party to divert resources if it is spending time canvassing ineligible voters and prevents candidates from running the most effective campaigns possible. However, Silva ruled in her latest dismissal that these reasons were unconvincing. The dismissal relied heavily on aSeptember rulingin the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals — the federal appeals court that oversees Nevada — that addressed the topic of whether organizations have standing to file a lawsuit. The ruling — which sought to clarify the confusing and conflicting precedent on organizational standing — asserted that groups “can no longer spend their way into standing based on vague claims that a policy hampers their mission.” In Silva’s ruling, she determined that the GOP groups “merely provide general assertions of what has happened, without any concrete specifics.” Additionally, Silva once again ruled that the state election officials had no opportunity to solve the alleged issue because federal law prohibits systematic voter roll changes within 90 days of an election. The original lawsuit was filed March 18, which was less than 90 days before Nevada’s June primaries. Silva allowed Republicans to file an updated lawsuit by Nov. 1 because the Ninth Circuit ruling was unavailable when the amended complaint was filed in July.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-return-to-nevada-obama-condemns-trumps-character-touts-harris-proposals,True,"Former President Barack Obama returned to Nevada on Saturday to stump for Vice President Kamala Harris, describing next month’s election as a choice between a candidate who will look out for everyday Americans versus someone whose decisions are made entirely based on his own self-interest. In remarks lasting about 45 minutes at Cheyenne High School in North Las Vegas, Obama touted Harris’ record and proposals to address still-too-high housing, grocery and health care costs, while spending much of his speech denigrating former President Donald Trump as a man who only looks out for himself and will prioritize making life easier for the most privileged. About 3,000 people were in the school’s at-capacity gym, with an additional 1,000 watching Obama — flanked by Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), who is running for re-election — on screens in a nearby overflow room. The rally comes as Obama continues to barnstorm battleground states in the final weeks of the election. It was his third rally for Harris in the past week, following stops in Pittsburgh and Tucson, and he will also rally alongside Harris next week in Georgia and Michigan. The rally, Obama’s first public appearance in the Silver State since herallied for state Democratsshortly before Election Day in 2022, came on the first day of in-person early voting in Nevada. As of late afternoon Saturday,more than 28,000 peoplein Clark County had voted in person, according to a county spokesperson, exceeding the 27,000 county residents who turned out on the first day of early voting four years ago. Similar to other swing states, the presidential contest is a dead heat in Nevada, withpolls often findingHarris and Trump separated by a few percentage points. Often considered a once-in-a-generation orator and rallier of the Democratic base, Obama has made stops in the closing weeks of election cycles since he left the White House about eight years ago. Democrats hope he can build enthusiasm and turn out those who may be considering sitting out. It’s a sentiment that was reflected Saturday among rally attendees, who said Obama’s ascent led to their support of Democratic politics. Ruthie Zolla, a 21-year-old college student from California who was in Las Vegas to canvass for Harris, remembered how Obama’s political rise spurred her interest in politics, including when she canvassed for Obama as a 6-year-old in Indiana in 2008. The topic of voter apathy was also on display during the speech, with Obama frequently acknowledging that life in America is imperfect, but that one way people can improve their lives is by voting. “If you hear somebody say it doesn't matter, it does matter, and someday it will make a difference to help them,” Obama said. “So whether this election is making you feel excited or scared or hopeful or frustrated or anywhere in between, do not sit back and hope for the best. Get off your couch and vote.” Trump’s character Much of Obama’s speech focused on Trump acting in his own self-interest. He criticized Trump and other Republicans forspreading liesrelated to the federal response to the recent hurricanes on the East Coast, which resulted, in at least one instance, an armed militia following emergency responders. He also condemned thereported commentthat Trump called fallen service members “losers.” “That kind of behavior is not OK,” Obama said. “Having people divided and angry and resentful … that increases his chance of being elected president.” He characterized Trump as a hypocrite who is only out for himself, referencing his selling of “God Bless the USA Bibles” thatThe Associated Pressreportedwere made in China. “This is Mr. Tough Guy on China except when he can make a few bucks,” Obama said. Obama also mocked Trump for some of his recent behavior at rallies, including one during which hestood on the stage dancingfor 40 minutes. “You would be worried if your grandpa started acting like this,” Obama said. In an interview before the event, Allan Margolin, a 25-year-old paralegal from Los Angeles, contrasted Trump and Obama’s characters, calling Obama “the most inspiring politician we’ve ever had.” His first time voting in 2008 was for Obama. “He's one of the people,” Margolin said. “He sees people for who they really are instead of being an elitist.” Obama also sought to contrast Harris and Trump’s plans if elected. He repeatedly dinged Trump for his comment at last month’s presidential debate that he had “concepts of a plan” related to the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care legislation passed during Obama’s first term. “He spent his entire presidency trying to tear it down, and he couldn’t even do that,” Obama said. ""He doesn't know how the Affordable Care Act works. He just knows that I did it."" John Villasenor, a 39-year-old primary care physician in Nevada, said he sees patients daily who have reaped the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. “These are such huge things that we don't want to lose,” Villasenor said. Obama also repeatedly criticized Trump for the tax cuts passed under his administration thatparticularly benefited billionaires. They are set to expire next year. “We do not need a president who makes problems worse just to make his politics better,” he said. “If you elect Kamala and [Minnesota Gov.] Tim [Walz], they won’t be focused on their problems, they’ll be focused on your problems.” He described Harris as a candidate who is “as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been.” He touted her policies to address the affordable housing crisis, which has emerged as an increasingly salient issue this year, including her pledge to build 3 million new homes and offer up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. He continued acknowledging that grocery prices remain too high, while also heralding Harris’ plan to ban corporate price gouging, thougheconomists are skepticalat how much it can truly help Americans. “Kamala is fighting on behalf of people who need a champion,” Obama said. And he alluded to the premise of “freedom” — arguing that Harris’ policies seek to give people freedom to breathe cleaner air, go to school safely and make their own health care decisions. ""For Donald Trump and his cronies, freedom just means getting away with stuff,” Obama said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-long-lines-nevada-early-voters-say-this-is-election-of-their-lifetimes,True,"Diane Brown was trembling as she waited to cast her early vote at the Galleria at Sunset in Henderson on Saturday morning. The 58-year-old school teacher said she has been obsessively reading about the election for months. For her, widespread misinformation and the rolling back of reproductive rights has her worried about the future of the country — especially its implications for her younger students. With that in mind, Brown said that couldn’t sit back and wait to vote. “My conscience is wearing very heavy on me,” Brown said. Like Brown, each of the 10 peopleThe Nevada Independentinterviewed — whether Democrat or Republican — expressed that this was the most important election of their lifetimes and that early voting was a way to ensure that their vote was counted in time. As the presidential race reaches its final stretch,Nevada remains a toss-upwith former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris remaining neck and neck, according to most polling. Despite the competitiveness of the race, most votersThe Indyspoke to were shocked by the turnout. As polls opened, the line at the Galleria mall ran down its entire length, even wrapping around one of the front entrances. Election officials said that more than 300 people voted within the first hour after polls opened at the location. Simba Mozarewa, who has voted early at the mall for years, said that he had never seen turnout like this. “Honestly, I'm surprised there's actually a line,” the 34-year-old prosecutor said. While the presidential election remained top of mind, Mozarewa said he was also keeping an eye on the local races — especially the judicial, Senate and House races. For him, it’s integral that candidates with similar platforms are elected to create a “cohesive” and “functioning” government that is actually able to pass an agenda. This year, however, Mozarewa is not as interested in specific policy issues: Democracy is the top issue for him. “Voting is one of the most central rights, and I would like to protect that,” he said. Donald Okami, a 49-year-old policeman, and his wife, who declined to give her name, said he was concerned  about voter fraud, especially after the 2020 presidential election, which they said was stolen. (Officialsin Nevadaand nationallyhave said there is no evidence of fraud so widespread that it could have altered the outcome of the 2020 election.) The couple came out to vote early partly as a preventive measure to ensure their votes were actually counted. Okami said that in the past, the pair were low-propensity voters, and they want a president that puts “America first.” The Okamis said they were cognizant of the ballot issues this year — many which they said go against their core values as Christians — and were definitely againstBallot Question 6,which proposes enshrining the right to an abortion in the state Constitution, although the procedure remains legal in Nevada through 24 weeks of pregnancy through state law. “The stakes are the highest they’ve ever been,” Okami said. “Look at what’s happening. The next step is either all-out war or peace.” Northern Nevada rallies Progressives and conservatives held get-out-the-vote events in Northern Nevada, encouraging supporters to cast, mail, or drop off ballots as soon as possible.At an afternoon rally in Carson City for Trump, Washoe County Republican Party chairman Bruce Parks encouraged a small crowd of supporters to “harvest ballots” for their family, friends, neighbors and fellow Trump supporters. Collecting ballots for others is a legal practice that, until recently, was decried by many in the GOP. In downtown Reno, the day started with a Women’s March featuring supporters carrying signs for the Democratic ticket. Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), have made women’s health care and abortion rights a campaign cornerstone. After the march — which saw more than 500 attendees walking up Virginia Street from the Federal Building to City Plaza — many participants went to the nearby Downtown Reno Library to vote. Lines across the region ranged widely. Wait times at most polling sites were a few minutes, but, at times, libraries in Northwest Reno, South Reno and North Valleys were more than an hour long.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-person-early-voting-is-starting-in-nevada-heres-what-to-know,True,"Saturday marks the start of in-person early voting — a method that, along with universal mail voting, vastly expands the window of opportunity for Nevadans to cast their ballot and has been newly embraced even on the conservative end of the political spectrum. For details on all of your voting and registration options, check outThe Nevada Independent’s general electionFAQ page, and take advantage of these in-depth resources to inform your choices: In-person early voting runs Saturday, Oct. 19 through Friday, Nov. 1. Officials from all stripes are marking the occasion this weekend — Republicans including Senate candidate Sam Brown, House candidate Drew Johnson and Assembly candidates are headlining a get-out-the-vote early voting rally Saturday. Democrats, having embraced early voting for several cycles, are bringing out former President Barack Obama — one of the most popular figures in the party — for a rally of their own on Saturday. The Harris campaign is bringing in surrogates from Nevada and California to hammer home the message in Las Vegas and Reno. Early voting gains favor In 2020, then-President Donald Trump spent months railing against vote-by-mail and early voting, falsely denigrating those methods — long popular in the West — as crooked. Republicans, trying to learn from their 2020 and 2022 mistakes, feel that not embracing those methods of voting — and sowing distrust among their voters — was a mistake. In the2022 midterm, about 51 percent of votes in Nevada were cast by mail and about 28 percent were cast early in person. In the 2020 presidential election, with the pandemic raging, the results were even more stark — only 11 percent of voters in Nevada voted in person on Election Day. In 2020 and 2022, more Republicans than Democrats took advantage of in-person early voting — but it was the least-used method for both parties in the midterms. This cycle, Republican campaigns are going all in on promoting early voting, even as Donald Trump has delivered mixed messages,calling it“stupid stuff” and insisting he would prefer paper ballots while alsoheadliningearly vote rallies. While the state Republican Party is on board, they’ve undermined their own message too — hosting a presidential caucus, for example, where only day-of in-person voting was permitted rather than the state-funded primary, which included mail voting and early voting. A Trump campaign official in Nevada said the campaign is not worried that Trump is undermining their message of confidence, and that Republican voters trust in early voting because the state party and Republican National Committee have beenactivein pushing preemptive lawsuits against the secretary of state — which the state and numerous judges have dismissed as baseless. Republican figures in the state including Gov. Joe Lombardo have been engagedsince last yearin attempting to restore confidence on the right in non-Election Day voting methods, acknowledging that parties can more efficiently target voters if they can drive members of their party to vote early. If more of a party’s voters cast a ballot early, party officials can spend the days and weeks before the election conducting outreach to the more narrow group of those who have not yet cast a ballot. “There’s definitely been a shift to encourage voters to engage with the system, knowing that this is the new way forward,” the Trump campaign official said. The launch of in-person voting and the pressure of the nation’s attention on swing state Nevada can be intense, but Clark County Registrar Lorena Portillo says her staff has learned from their experiences in 2020 and has prepared for a wide range of scenarios. “I do not get distracted about the fact that something can happen, right?” Portillo toldThe Indyin an interview earlier this week. “No, we have the proper plans in place, and we have the proper protocols in place, and the folks that have been made aware and have been part of the plan are very confident, as much as I am.” ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-assembly-district-41-candidates-sandra-jauregui-and-rafael-arroyo,True,"The race for Assembly District 41 between Assembly Majority Leader Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) and Republican business owner Rafael Arroyo is set to be a competitive one and key to whether Democrats can hold a two-thirds supermajority in the Assembly. Assembly District 41, which straddles St. Rose Parkway and includes parts of Henderson and unincorporated parts of Clark County, has long leaned Democratic. About 32 percent of the 55,000 voters in the district are registered as Democrats, while 26 percent are registered Republicans and the other 32 percent are nonpartisan. Jauregui, 41, has been a state lawmaker since 2016 and currently is the Democratic majority leader — thethird-highest-rankingmember of the Nevada Assembly. The California native moved to Nevada decades ago to attend UNLV and got roped into Nevada politics, interning for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). Afterwards, she worked for Nevada nonprofits focused on helping people affected by the foreclosure crisis and politicians including Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV). She currently works for Hilltop Public Solutions, a political consulting firm. Reid’s legacy continues to influence her, Jauregui said. “One of his biggest things is labor till the work is done,” she said. “I think that's a work ethic I've carried with me.” Arroyo is a political newcomer relative to Jauregui, but contends that his background as a small-business owner will give him a leg up in understanding constituents' economic concerns. The 39-year-old was born in Puerto Rico, but moved to Las Vegas as a child when his mom got a job as a teacher at the Clark County School District — something that continues to influence his understanding of Nevada’s education system. “I found out if you don't get involved with the government, the government is going to get involved with you,” Arroyo said. Arroyo has beenendorsedby Gov. Joe Lombardo and has been avocal supporter of former President Donald Trump. Arroyo was on stage as a participant in a North Las Vegas roundtable during the weekend featuring Trump and Latino voters. Despite Arroyo’s high-level endorsements, Jauregui has significantly outraised her GOP opponent, a key predictor of victory. Shebrought inabout $130,000 in the third quarter, while Arroyo posted ahaulof $38,000. ON THE POLICIES Education School choice programs such as Nevada’s Opportunity Scholarships have been a lightning rod issue since their creation in 2015 and are likely to come up again during the next legislative session. Opportunity Scholarships, funded by businesses that donate to them in exchange for a tax credit, subsidize the cost of attending private schools for eligible low- and middle-income students but have limited enrollment and strict income eligibility requirements. Jauregui said that the government shouldn’t “disrupt the education” of students who are currently receiving Opportunity Scholarships, although she opposes school choice options. “Public dollars should stay in public schools,” Jauregui said. Arroyo, like other GOP candidates, is a proponent of school choice programs, citing the success of states such as Floridawhere enrollment at charter and private schools has ballooned. Arroyo argues that school choice programs also hold schools “accountable” for their performance. Tax credits Jauregui has long been a proponent of tax credits for the film industry, leading efforts to introduce them in Nevada. In June, Jauregui submitted a bill draft request to revivethe Nevada Studio Infrastructure, Jobs and Workforce Training Act—a proposalthat would expand film tax credits and create a workforce training program — in the upcoming legislative session. “I believe in bringing new industries into our economy,” Jauregui said. “The film industry is an industry that's going to bring high-paying, six-figure-paying jobs to Nevada.” Arroyo expressed hesitancy about tax credits for Nevada’s burgeoning film industry, saying it comes down to the “individual deal.” Although he believes that expanding the film industry could help diversify Nevada’s economy, he worries that it won’t end up benefiting working-class Nevadans. ​​”If we can protect Nevadans and make sure they're getting a good deal, then it's a win-win for everyone,” Arroyo said. Gun control As a survivor of the 1 October mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017,Jauregui said that “gun reform” is one of her main priorities as a legislator. While in the Legislature, Jauregui has shepherded legislation expandinguniversal background checks,banning bump stops, banning ghost guns, and enactingred flag lawsthat allow police or family members to ask for a court protection order preventing high-risk individuals from having guns. As she heads into this year’s legislative session, she said she will continue to fight for such policies. “I hope that when I leave the Legislature, I can say that my work around gun violence prevention has made our state a safer place,” she said. Arroyo said he is a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights and that he believes having access to firearms is key to self-defense. “The police can't guarantee your safety when there's a situation,” Arroyo said. Health care Jauregui is a proponent of allowing the state to adopt drug prices negotiated by Medicare, a measure that legislative Democrats planto reintroducein 2025 after Lombardo vetoed the bill AB250 in 2023. “I think that's a policy area that we need to work on, whether it's AB250 or whether it's[pharmacy benefit manager]reform and really making sure that those rebates are getting passed down to the consumers,” Jauregui said. Arroyo says that his top priority in the health care sphere is improving the state’s mental health system (Nevada is among the lowest-ranked states), especially for unhoused people. “There's a lot of pressure on people, and maybe people turn to substances to deal with their stress and the pressure,” Arroyo said. Housing In her previous terms, Jauregui has worked on an array of housing reforms throughout Nevada. She sponsoredAB213, a bill that aimed to prioritize and incentivize affordable housing development, andAB298, which would have required landlords to refund application fees to prospective tenants who were not selected to rent the property, although that bill was ultimately vetoed by Lombardo. Arroyo is a supporter of the bipartisan effort to open up federal land for housing development, contending that Nevada’s current housing affordability crisis is an “issue of supply and demand.” He also contends that there is too much bureaucratic red tape in opening up these developments. Voter ID Jauregui opposes Question 7, the voter ID initiative on this year’s ballot, contending that it is a part of a larger GOP effort to undermine elections and voting. Like other GOP candidates, Arroyo favors voter ID laws and believes that it will further instill confidence in the election systemduring a time when trust in election integrity is low among  the general public. Arroyo contends that Nevada’s proposed voter ID initiative is relatively lax  compared with his native Puerto Rico, where eligible residents are required to have voter registration cards. Arroyo also dismissed claims that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election — a belief that many other GOP candidates have espoused.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/with-supermajority-at-stake-fundraising-battle-is-tight-in-key-nevada-legislative-races,True,"Democrats and Republicans running in the most consequential Nevada legislative races continue to be neck and neck in fundraising and cash on hand as the election cycle enters its home stretch, campaign finance reports released this week show. Across the 10 contests most likely to determine whether Democrats secure a two-thirds supermajority in both chambers, the Democratic candidate in six of those races outraised their Republican opponent from July through September. Democrats also had more cash on hand at the end of September than their GOP counterparts in six of the 10 races. The findings — which represent the final look at a campaign’s finances before ballots are cast — continue theyearlongtrendof a tight fundraising battle in the races that are key to whether Democrats win two-thirds of the seats in each chamber, which would allow them to overturn vetoes issued by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. Lombardo has shown himself more than willing to exercise his veto authority, rejecting a record 75 of the 611 bills that came to his desk last session and touting himself as a potent, one-man backstop to policies from the left in a state with deep structural advantages for Democrats. Democrats have little room for error. They control 13 seats in the 21-member state Senate (one shy of the two-thirds supermajority) and 28 seats — a supermajority — in the 42-member Assembly. In the 10 racesThe Nevada Independenthas deemed most important, based on electoral history and district partisanship, three of them are currently controlled by Republicans. In total, the Democrats in these races raked in about $1.38 million from July through September, while Republicans posted a haul of $1.34 million. All but five of the candidates in these races also raised six figures in the third quarter. While money is not the end-all, be-all in legislative races, it still plays an important role. It allows candidates to reach voters through advertisements and campaign flyers and can signal to donors, the media and insiders which candidates are committed to winning and who may be vulnerable to defeat. A fundraising advantage is also consistently a predictor of victory. In the past two election cycles, the margins of victory in 14 legislative races were less than 5 percentage points. Across these races, 12 of the candidates who raised more money through the end of September won their races, according to aNevada Independentanalysis. The latest campaign finance reports continue to show Lombardo’s campaign machine in full force. The Lombardo-affiliated Better Nevada PAC gave $5,000 to nine legislative candidates (in all of the most consequential races except for Senate District 15, a GOP-held open seat in Reno that is likely to turn blue because redistricting has made the district more favorable to Democrats). Additionally, as is common in Nevada politics, a host of candidate committees from both parties gave money to candidates in the key races, and casinos were also common donors. There were some prominent names in the campaign finance reports. Oakland Athletics owner John Fisher gave $10,000 to a Republican challenging a Democratic senator who voted against the public financing bill to bring his team to Las Vegas, UFC CEO Dana White donated $5,000 to eight GOP candidates and civil rights attorney Ben Crump gave $9,000 to a Democrat running in a red Assembly district.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-congressional-district-3-candidates-susie-lee-and-drew-johnson,True,"Experts agree the congressional race between Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) and her Republican opponent Drew Johnson, a conservative policy and tax analyst, in swingy District 3leanssquarely towardLee this November. But as the election reaches its home stretch, both candidates have been ramping up efforts to draw in voters in District 3, which encompasses parts of Las Vegas and Henderson and where 35 percent are registered as nonpartisans, 30 percent are Democrats, and 26 percent are Republican. Although former President Donald Trump won the district in 2016, Lee has represented it since 2019, winning re-election in 2020 by 3 percentage points and by 4 points in 2022, after it was redrawn to be more favorable to Democrats. Lee, 57, remains significantly ahead of Johnson in fundraising. She has raised nearly $5.4 million dollars this cycle compared with the roughly $1.2 million Johnson has raised (more than half of that amount was self-funded)according to the Federal Election Commission. An analysis from AdImpact, meanwhile, found that Democrats have poured nearly $7.8 million into ads backing Lee since the primary, while GOP-aligned groups have spent a little more than $20,000 in the race during that period. Lee said that in addition to continuing her mission to revamp Nevada’s economy, as a deeply committed bipartisan lawmaker, she’d like to continue to fight against the hyper-partisanship that has taken over Congress. “I've been ranked the most bipartisan member of Congress,” Lee noted. “I'm going to continue to do that. I think that this country is served better when Congress comes together in the middle.” Outside of Congress, Lee spent 25 years leading nonprofits, includingCommunities In Schools of Nevada,a local organization that helps at-risk kids graduate high school. The Ohio-born congresswoman has been in Nevada since 1993 and said that one of her main motivations for running again is to continue to work for the community's interests, not “Washington’s.” This isn’t Johnson’s first race either. The 44-year-old moved to Las Vegas about nine years ago and ran for Clark County Commission in 2022, losing by less than half a percentage point to incumbent Justin Jones. The Tennessee native said that his working-class upbringing drew him to politics, contending that seeing “the failures of government” made him want to “hold government accountable as a career.” His 2022 Clark County race, he said, taught him some “really important lessons.” “A lot of people wanted me to say that the election was stolen,” Johnson said. “The fact of the matter is that we as Republicans stole the election from ourselves because we did not turn out.” Although Johnson has criticized firebrand conservatives and says he identifies as a “small L libertarian,” the Republican candidate has beenendorsedby Donald Trump and members of theFreedom Caucus, widely considered to be the most far-right bloc in the House. Currently, he is also a senior scholar at National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank that does work in free markets, environmental and regulatory policy. Lee and Johnson were highly critical of each other in their interviews withTheNevada Independent.Johnson repeatedly claimed that Lee failed to help working-class families during her congressional tenure and that he would finally bring a better economic outlook for the group. Lee, meanwhile, says that Johnson is insincere about his platform — especially his support of abortion protections. Lee contends that Johnson is trying “to have it both ways” — receiving the support of candidates such as Donald Trump, who was president whenRoe. v Wadewas overturned — and is “ducking behind Nevada's strong pro-choice laws.” “If you're throwing the decision back to the states, then that means that you are OK with politicians making a decision that women should be making,” Lee said. ON THE POLICIES Social Security Lee said that one of her biggest accomplishments is her work on Social Security. While representing the district, Lee's office has closed more than7,000 cases for Southern Nevadans and returned more than $31 million to individuals for casework involving Social Security, the IRS or the Department of Veterans Affairs, she said. Social Security is somewhat in free fall right now, however, with its reserves projected to be entirely depleted by 2035, according tothe Congressional Research Service. Congress has been scrambling to find solutions, whether that's raising revenue, making cuts to the program or some combination of the two. Democrats have come after Johnson forpublic statementshe has made supporting raising the retirement age to fill the spending gap. A spokesperson for Lee said the congresswoman does not support raising the retirement age or cutting Social Security. However, in an interview this June withThe Nevada Independent,Johnson said he believes that the shortfall can be addressed without raising the retirement age by auditing the Social Security Disability Insurance rolls and cutting government spending elsewhere. Johnson said that when he began his campaign, he talked to seniors and veterans who had encountered issues with their Social Security — a key motivator behind his decision to run. “These are things that Susie, admittedly, was good at early in her time in Congress, but as time has gone on, her priorities have changed,” Johnson said. Housing Lee and Johnson agreed that housing costs are one of the top issues facing Nevadans. If elected, Lee said she will continue to fight to make federal land available for housing developments (more than85 percent of landwithin Nevada’s borders is owned by the federal government). In July, the House passedLee’s Accelerating Appraisals and Conservation Efforts(AACE) Act, which she said would cut bureaucratic red tape and speed up housing projects on federal lands. She said that she would also fight for additional funding for affordable housing projects across the state. Johnson said that Nevada needs to get “as much federal land back in our hands as possible,” although he expressed concerns about conservation efforts and water rights. Abortion Lee said that it's crucial that Congress enshrines and protects a woman's right to an abortion. She is alsoa proponentofThe Right to IVF Act, which would protect access to and expand insurance coverage of fertility treatments, andthe Women’s Health Protection Act of 2023, which bans certain restrictions on abortion. Lee conceived her two children through in vitro fertilization, saying that for her, the stakes are personal. Johnson previously said the 2022 Dobbs decision overturningRoe v. Wade“appropriately” left the question to the states,and he said he “strongly opposes a federal abortion ban.” He also said that he would oppose any restrictions on IVF. Tax policy Johnson says that he is in favor of keeping the Trump-era tax cuts thatslashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percentand cut individual income tax rates as well, although many of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act helping individuals and families expire in 2025. He contends that “the narrative that [tax cut legislation]has only helped rich people is one of the greatest falsehoods I think I’ve ever seen” and that it boosted the middle class. An analysisfrom the Brookings Institute backs up Johnson, finding that although the cuts had the largest benefits for the wealthy, provisions such as the increased standard deduction and expanded child tax credit did benefit middle-income Americans. Both candidates say they are in favor of expanding the child tax credit and ending taxes on tips. Lee, however, says she wants “very specific guardrails” on any no tax on tip policy, ensuring that it also applies to gig workers such as Uber drivers. A spokesperson for her campaign said that “too often has Trump given tax breaks to big corporations and the wealthiest Americans.” Health care Lee said that she is “absolutely” in favor of letting Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices. During the September presidential debate, Trump took a stab at the Affordable Care Act (ACA, widely known as Obamacare) and called for it to be eliminated, reopening the debate about theonce unpopular policy. Although Lee said she’s against eliminating the ACA, she’d like to see some “refinements” to it, continuing to home in and make pricing models more affordable. Johnson, on the other hand, called the ACA “horrific.” When the policy was instituted, Johnson was in his 20s and was paying “out of pocket” for his insurance. After the ACA passed, Johnson had to purchase minimum essential coverage, as mandated by the ACA, which he said was an additional expense that cut his quality of life. Johnson didn’t directly say if he was opposed to allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, but contended that lowering the costs (an accomplishment that Lee has touted) could stifle medical innovation. He suggested that lowering drug prices will “strip the intellectual property rights” from pharmaceutical companies. “The biggest concern I have with Susie Lee's proposals — with a lot of these Democratic proposals — is to basically cut the amount of money that a drug company can make from bringing a drug to market,” Johnson said. Immigration Lee said that “comprehensive immigration reform” is necessary. She has called for stricter border control and additional pathways for legal residency. If elected, Lee said that she would be in favor of reintroducing a bipartisan border security deal that GOP senators rejected at thebehest of Trumpthat would have hired 1,500 new Border Patrol agents and cracked down on fentanyl trafficking. Lee previously supported theBipartisan Dignity Act, which would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, and opposed her party’s decision to end Title 42, a public health policy from 1944 activated during the Trump administration that allowed U.S. officials to turn away migrants who came to the U.S.-Mexico border on the grounds of preventing COVID-19. Johnson said that he would push to restore Title 42 if elected. Although he said he isn’t in favor of a mass deportation campaign — a policy that the Trump campaign has pushed for — he is in favor of making it “easier to kick out illegal immigrants.” Yucca Mountain Lee said that she is opposed to using Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste repository. “It’s not a matter of if, but when there will be an accident,” she said, adding that it could endanger human lives and railway infrastructure. However, Lee said she is open to the creation of a “consent-based siting” for a nuclear waste storage facility, meaning that a community must agree to host the facility and play an active role in the decision-making process. Currently, Lee is co-chair of the House Nuclear Cleanup Caucus with Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN). Johnson said that as Yucca Mountain is not in his district, he “defers” his opinion to “the people most affected.” However, Johnsonhas previously saidthat he could potentially see being more open to the proposal. Election policy Lee said that she is “undecided” about Question 3, which would implement open primaries and ranked-choice voting, expressing hesitancy regarding the “mechanics” of how it would work and its efficacy. High-ranking elected Democrats, the state Democratic Party and the state Republican Party have opposed the measure. Lee is also opposed to Question 7, the voter ID initiative on this year’s ballot, contending that it is a part of a larger GOP effort to undermine elections and voting. Johnson said that he is in favor of Question 7, saying that requiring ID to vote “just makes sense.” He also said that he is against Question 3.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-senate-debate-rosen-and-brown-stick-to-campaign-playbooks,True,"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and military veteran Sam Brown squared off Thursday night in their only debate of the cycle, going toe to toe on issues such as bringing down costs for Nevada families and securing the southern border. In a live, one-hour, televised debate in Las Vegas hosted by 8 News Now, the CBS affiliate, the two candidates often reverted back to their general campaign playbooks, with Brown accusing Rosen of being out of touch with Nevadans’ lives and Rosen focusing on her own Senate record. Moderators — two Channel 8 anchors and one reporter — asked questions on a slew of policy areas, including the economy, immigration, energy and abortion, as well as adding a moment of levity when they asked whether Congress should conduct an independent investigation into the presence of UFOs — to which Rosen agreed, and Brown said “maybe Elon Musk can” because he does not fully trust Congress before pivoting to attacking Rosen’s stock holdings. But the two also frequently did not answer questions directly posed by the moderators — even after being asked follow-up questions — with Rosen often praising her record, and Brown switching gears to criticize Rosen for helping President Joe Biden’s administration pass its agenda. There were also a few gaffes — Brown said at one point that under former President Donald Trump “we saw record illegal crossings, we need that again” and Rosen said that she met with the hostages taken by Hamas (she met with the families of hostages). It was a debate that provided little news and instead brought into sharper focus both candidates’ general campaign strategies, which were summed up through their closing statements. Brown said Rosen was beholden to “coastal elites” and “D.C. talking points,” and urged voters to turn the page, while Rosen noted her 50-year residency in Nevada and record of bipartisanship, without explicitly pointing out that Brown — who moved to Reno in 2018 — has had a shorter tenure. All cycle long, Rosen, a first-term senator from Henderson and former computer programmer and synagogue president, has held polling and fundraising leads over Brown, an Army veteran who is running for the Senate for a second straight cycle. While polls have slightly tightened in recent weeks, RealClearPolling’s monthly average stillfindsRosen up 5.5 percentage points, and she has beenamong the best fundraisersfor sitting Senate candidates. After the debate, which was held at Channel 8’s studios in Las Vegas, both candidates had the opportunity to speak with reporters. Brown and his team left immediately after the debate ended, while Rosen took a few questions in the makeshift “spin room.” Rosen, in a brief interview withThe Indy, said the strategy of focusing on her record rather than characterizing Brown personally, particularly where it’s Nevada-centric, was “intentional.” Economy Routinely ranked as the top issue in polling in a state whose economic recovery has lagged behind the rest of the country, Rosen sought to portray economic frustration as a referendum on corporate behavior while Brown laid the blame on Democratic spending. Rosen acknowledged rising prices during the course of Biden’s presidency and touted legislation she’s sponsored to take on corporations, including opposing the Kroger-Albertsons merger and cracking down on corporate homebuying. In response to a question on one policy he would bring to reduce grocery costs, Brown pivoted to energy policies, accusing Rosen and the Biden administration of driving up energy costs by investing in clean energy programs. The two also discussed a policy they both support — ending taxation on tips, a key flashpoint in the presidential race since Trump proposed it in Las Vegas in June and Harris followed suit two months later. Rosen and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) were also the first Democrats to sign onto aproposalfrom Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to end federal taxation on tips. Brown did not answer a question about who specifically should be the beneficiaries of a policy to end taxes on tipped wages, saying “if you’re receiving tips, then you ought to not have to pay taxes on those tips.” He also repeated his support of ending taxes on Social Security benefits. Meanwhile, Rosen, taking a populist tack, said that the conversation on the policy should “start with” hospitality workers, including servers, bartenders and waitresses, and that there should be limits to ensure that CEOs don’t count bonuses as tips and therefore not pay taxes on them. “W​hen we work on these bills, [we have to] make sure we put in guardrails so that giant corporations, those greedy CEOs that are ripping you off, making record profit quarter after quarter, don't decide that their salary or bonus is a tip and they don't pay taxes,” she said. She also said there needs to be federal legislation related to the subminimum wage for tipped workers, which has been abolished in Nevada. Rep. Steven Horsford (R-NV) introducedlegislationending taxes on tips while also putting a national ban on the subminimum wage, which can be as low as $2.13 hourly in some states. Abortion Brown reiterated the position he announced in February that he would not support a national abortion ban, in accordance with Nevada law protecting abortion up to 24 weeks — a departure from a position he took in Texas during a state legislative run a decade ago, when hesupporteda 20-week ban. Rosen took the opportunity to pounce on the issue, which has been a key focus in her ads and in her attacks on Brown. Brown noted that he was against any adjustments to the filibuster — the Senate threshold that requires 60 votes to end debate and pass most legislation — while Rosen said she would support a carveout for restoringRoe v. Wade. Housing Housing has continually polled high among top issues for Nevadans, with home and rental pricessurgingand the state significantly lacking a supply of affordable housing. Rosen took the opportunity to plug legislation she has introduced to crack down on corporate homebuying, an issue that is particularlyprevalentin North Las Vegas. Rosen also did not answer a question about which specific corporations are taking over the housing market, referring to them as “big Wall Street investors.” The two also discussed the Washoe County lands bill, a Rosen proposal that would open up new federal lands for development — including 35 acres for housing — while permanently protecting other parcels for conservation. In the lengthy history of Nevada lands bills, Rosen’s proposal is the first to include a set-aside for affordable housing — but Brown dinged her on it, saying 35 acres is too low. Immigration Brown would not directly answer when asked if he would support Trump’s pledge to conduct a mass deportation, saying such a plan would be a “very big logistical undertaking” that starts with greater border security and deportation of criminals who came to the U.S. illegally. Rosen, as Democrats around the country have done,notedher support for a bipartisan border security bill that would have restricted asylum, while adding that she wants to see a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and Temporary Protected Status holders. She did not directly say whether the next president should keep new border policies implemented by Biden in place. Energy The two clashed on clean energy numerous times — Brown accused Democrats, including Rosen, of driving up gas prices by favoring clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. Rosen defended those investments, noting that clean energy industries are significant employers in Nevada, particularly in the solar, geothermal and wind sectors. The Inflation Reduction Act has sentbillions of dollarsto Nevada through tax credits, loans and grants to build out clean energy investments. Rosen, who voted for it, touted those investments in solar and lithium in particular. Brown countered by saying that sustainable energy leads to higher costs. Foreign policy With the debateoccurringon the same day that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in Gaza, both candidates were asked about whether there was any red line when it came to supporting Israel. Brown said that there was no red line Israel could cross to lose his support, and praised Trump for the peaceful era in the Middle East during his presidency. Rosen, who is one of the most active supporters of Israel among Senate Democrats and traveled to the region a week after the Oct. 7 attack, said that Israel has a responsibility to limit civilian casualties and ensure humanitarian aid gets into Gaza, while noting that Israel has a right to defend itself — the most common position held by Democrats running in vulnerable seats this year. Rosen and Brown said they opposed a new Biden administration policy giving the Israelis 30 days to ensure aid gets into Gaza, under threat of an arms embargo. This story was updated at 10:00 a.m. on 10/18/24 to correct when Sam Brown announced he would not support a national abortion ban.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/a-man-arrested-with-guns-outside-a-trump-rally-in-california-is-suing-the-sheriff,True,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A Nevada man who was arrested over the weekend with guns at a security checkpoint outside a Donald Trump rally in the southern California desert has filed a lawsuit accusing the sheriff of falsely characterizing his arrest as a thwarted assassination attempt for his own personal gain. The man, identified as 49-year-old Vem Miller of Las Vegas, had been driving an unregistered black SUV with a ""homemade"" license plate when he was stopped by deputies assigned to the rally in Coachella, east of Los Angeles, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said Sunday at a news conference. Miller had a shotgun, loaded handgun, ammunition and several fake passports in his vehicle, Bianco said. Miller was released the same day on $5,000 bail. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Nevada says Bianco lied about the fake passports, and that he ""created a narrative so as to be viewed as a 'heroic' Sheriff who saved Presidential candidate Trump."" It names as defendants the sheriff, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department and a sheriff's deputy. A call to the sheriff's executive office for comment Wednesday was deferred to the department's communications office, which did not respond to an email. The Associated Press also emailed Miller's lawyer, Sigal Chattah, for comment. Security is very tight atTrump ralliesfollowing two recent assassination attempts. Last month, a man was indicted on an attempted assassination charge after authorities said he staked out the former president for 12 hours and wrote of his desire to kill him. The Florida arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Bianco said that Miller also claimed to be a journalist, but that it was unclear if he had the proper credentials. Deputies noticed the interior of the vehicle was ""in disarray"" and a search uncovered the weapons and ammo, along with multiple passports and driver licenses with different names, Bianco said. Miller's lawsuit accuses the sheriff's department of illegally searching the SUV. It also says that he willingly disclosed to officers at the checkpoint that he had weapons but intended to leave them in the vehicle. Miller is scheduled to appear in court in January in the weapons case. He was arrested on suspicion of possessing a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine, according to online records.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-assembly-district-21-candidate-april-arndt,True,"For a third straight election cycle, a Democratic assemblywoman in the southern Las Vegas Valley is locked in a tight contest. Assemblywoman Elaine Marzola (D-Las Vegas) has won each of her past two elections by less than 5 percentage points against far-right conservatives. This year, she is squaring off against April Arndt, a former officer with the Henderson Police Department who easily beat Marzola’s 2022 opponent in the June primary. The race for Assembly District 21 is among the handful of seats crucial to whether Democrats retain their two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature’s lower chamber. They currently occupy exactly two-thirds of the 42 seats, leaving little room for error if they want the ability to override vetoes issued by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. To do so, they must also net one more seat in the state Senate. The district’s composition has changed in recent years. At the time of Marzola’s past two victories, Democrats made up the largest share of registered voters in the district. But this year, nonpartisans are the largest group in the district, with the Democratic share shrinking by 8 percentage points in the past four years and the GOP share falling slightly amid redistricting and automatic voter registration. As we have in the othermost important legislative racesthis cycle,The Indyreached out to both candidates to learn more about their policy positions and campaign strategy. Arndt agreed to a phone interview, while Marzola did not after multiple requests, citing a lack of availability because of her work and campaign. After retiring from the Henderson Police Department, Arndt said she began talking to community members about a career in politics. She added that while she was a police officer and detective, she saw families affected by abuse and small businesses left at the mercy of regulations — and that she thinks politics is a way to help solve those issues. “I just have this deep, empathetic connection to real issues facing our community,” Arndt said. “When you're truly connected in those issues and you can be a strong voice for the people, I think that is when you say, ‘OK, I can do this.’” Marzola is a Brazilian immigrant who has been a personal injury lawyer since 2011. In the 2023 legislative session, she served as the chair of the Assembly Commerce and Labor Committee and vice chair of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. In recent weeks, Republican and Democratic groups have launched misleading attack ads against both candidates. Better Nevada PAC, a group tied to Lombardo,sent out a maileraccusing Marzola of spending $127 million on new government offices in Las Vegas for herself and other colleagues, as well as $30 million for an additional 117 new staff members. This refers to the Capital Improvement Programbudget billpassed by lawmakers last year. It misleads voters by implying that Marzola was responsible for the passage of the bill, when in reality, it was a priority for Lombardo, who called a special session to pass the bill after it failed to receive enough support in the regular session. Four Republican legislators also supported the bill. The Democratic New Day Nevada PACreleased an adthat said “for too long, politicians like April Arndt have been ghosting their constituents in favor of money from wealthy corporate donors.” However, Arndt has never held elected office and therefore has not represented constituents. Click below to learn more about both candidates’ policy positions. Education Criminal justice Elections Housing Health care Reproductive rights Gun control Lottery Education A policy likely to resurface during next year’s legislative session is Opportunity Scholarships, a program championed by Republicans and opposed by Democrats that offers businesses tax credits in exchange for donations that subsidize the cost of attending private schools in Nevada for certain low- and middle-income students. Arndt, a mother of three, said she wants these scholarships to be expanded. Her children have attended public, private and charter schools in Southern Nevada, and she has found that not every student is suited for the public school system. “They just learn differently. They thrive in different environments,” Arndt said. “We need to find a fit — whatever excites them, motivates them, gets them on a path to success to be contributing members of society.” Meanwhile, Marzola, a first-generation college graduate, does not address Opportunity Scholarships on hercampaign website, which instead touts her support ofSB503, the landmark education funding bill passed last year that provided a 26 percent increase in per-pupil funding in public schools. No Republicans supported the bill. Arndt credited Lombardo with signing SB503, calling it “the first step to getting up to par” with nationwide averages of per-pupil funding. Other education areas that Arndt said she wants to see addressed include improving transportation systems for charter schools and retaining teachers, which she said has become more difficult based on teacher safety concerns and low pay. “It's hard to find a teacher that says, ‘I love my environment, I love going to work every day,’” Arndt said. “They are tasked with more responsibility, they're the most educated professionals, but not equally compensated among professionals for their education levels.” The Legislature has made an effort to increase teacher pay. In 2023, all lawmakers except one Republican voted to supportlegislationthat set up a $250 million pot of state matching funds for teacher and support staff salaries. Criminal justice As a former police officer, Arndt said that her interest in politics stemmed from the passage of a 2019 criminal justice reform package that she said made the law too lenient. The legislation,AB236, was designed to curb a ballooning prison population and included provisions such as raising the threshold to warrant a felony theft charge from $650 to $1,200 worth of stolen goods.StatewideandClark Countydata show property crime rates have remained relatively stable in the years since the legislation passed, with some increases in 2022 and 2023. Arndt, who was a member of a retail theft task force, said those thresholds should be lowered. “The people that work in retail theft are organized. They understand what the limits are,” Arndt said. “Thresholds are a deterrent.” The legislation also adopted a new designation that possession of 100 grams of certain illegal drugs would trigger a low-level trafficking charge, punishable by two to 20 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $100,000. In 2023, a bipartisan group of lawmakers (including Marzola) passedSB35, which lowered the threshold to trigger a fentanyl trafficking charge to possession of 28 grams, punishable by one to 10 years imprisonment. The legislation was a middle ground between the 2019 law and a Lombardo proposal that would have raised penalties for fentanyl possession in any quantity. Arndt said she would support a lower threshold and condemned Democrats for the 28-gram threshold they pushed for. “We definitely have to make crime, criminal,” Arndt said. Marzola was not in office at the time of the criminal justice reform package. Her website does not mention criminal justice, but it does laud her support of the state’s budget that included pay raises for state law enforcement and firefighters. Elections Nevadans will vote on aballot questionthis year about whether to require voter ID. Arndt called the question “common sense” and said she helped gather 8,000 signatures for the petition to qualify the question for the ballot. It is unclear how Marzola will vote on it, but Democrats are largely against the measure, saying it is unnecessary and could disenfranchise voters who do not have ID. Another contentious election topic is so-called “ballot harvesting,” which is the process of collecting and submitting ballots on behalf of others that Nevada permanently legalized in 2021. Republicansfalsely claimedin 2020 that this practice led to massive voter fraud, but they have since moderated their positions because of its legality. Arndt said she would vote to criminalize ballot harvesting and that every measure should be taken to rebuild trust in elections. If it cannot be made illegal again, she would support requiring ballot collectors to register with election officials. Asked whether she believed the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump, Arndt did not directly answer and said “it is what it is, and we move forward.” “I don't spend any time thinking about that. I think it's a waste of energy,” Arndt said. Housing A proposal withbipartisan agreementin Nevada is freeing up federally owned land in the state for affordable housing development. While the issue is likely to be addressed at the federal level, Arndt said “it's economics 101, supply and demand.” “Releasing that land from the federal government will allow them to build, it will allow them to create inventory,” she said. “There's no one solution for everything, but that's the best start.” A controversial housing policy in Nevada is the state’ssummary eviction process, which requires the tenant to make the first legal filing in an eviction case, not the landlord, as is common practice in almost all other states. Marzola and other Democrats voted for legislation to amend the process by requiring a landlord to make the first legal filing in an eviction case. ButLombardo vetoed it, arguing it would “impose additional and unnecessary delays and costs” to the eviction process. Arndt agreed with Lombardo’s veto and does not think that amending the eviction process “would dramatically help those tenants.” Health care About 15 years ago, Arndt was undergoing training to be a crisis intervention officer, which included visiting mental health facilities across Clark County, where she heard the same thing repeatedly. “There just weren't resources,” Arndt said. “There weren't enough doctors, there weren't enough facilities, the facilities that they did have didn't quite meet everybody's needs.” She also noted that youth mental health has gotten progressively worse because of cellphones and the continued effects of pandemic-era school closures. She said the top priority for mental health is developing a strategy to recruit and retain providers, but she did not go into specifics on what that may look like beyond increasing capacity in medical residency programs. Marzola has sponsored legislation related to health care providers. She was a primary sponsor ofAB283, which became law and seeks to incentivizedoulaservices in rural areas. Meanwhile, Marzola’s website mentions her support of lowering prescription drug costs, an apparent reference to her support of AB250, the bill vetoed by Lombardo toallow the stateto adopt drug prices negotiated by Medicare.Arndt said she was unsure if the proposal in AB250 was the right strategy to address high drug prices. Reproductive rights Marzola was one of 10 primary sponsors for thebillto establish a constitutional right to reproductive freedom in the state. It passed along party lines and is expected to be voted on again next year. Voters will also decide on aballot questionto enshrine abortion rights in the state Constitution. It is largely being opposed by Republicans, who say it is unnecessary and a ploy to increase Democratic turnout. Arndt did not say how she would vote on it, but that she would support the will of the people. Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) is also planning tointroduce legislationnext year to protect in vitro fertilization in the state, which Arndt said she would support. Gun control Lombardovetoed a trio of gun control billslast year that would have placed restrictions on gun ownership for people convicted of a hate crime, raised the legal age to purchase certain firearms to 21 and criminalized bringing a gun within 100 feet of an election site. Marzola supported all of those bills, while Arndt said she would not support overturning Lombardo’s vetoes. Lottery For a second straight legislative session, lawmakers will vote on a constitutional amendment to repeal the state’s ban on lotteries.Marzola supported the legislation to allow a lottery (AJR5) last session, while Arndt said she is opposed to the lottery.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/democrats-continue-fundraising-dominance-in-nevada-congressional-races,True,"Nevada Democrats running for Congress significantly outraised their Republican opponents from July through September, the latest sign of a massive Democratic resource advantage as the election cycle enters its home stretch, according to campaign finance reports released this week. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) raised more than $12 million across the three-month period, about $3.5 million more than her Republican opponent, Sam Brown. In the three U.S. House races in Southern Nevada, Democrats raked in hundreds of thousands more than their Republican opponents, despite two Republicans loaning their campaigns more than $400,000 each. And in the state’s lone Republican-held district, Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) is also at a financial disadvantage after his opponent, independent Greg Kidd, loaned his campaign $4 million during the past three months, making up essentially his entire fundraising haul. Candidates can claw back that loaned money if they don't spend it. The fundraising numbers continue the yearlong trend of Republicans trailing their Democratic counterparts. Rosen has significantly outraised Brown all cycle, while GOP House candidates in Southern Nevada have been unable to keep up with Democrats’ small-dollar donations and support from their national party. While the reports released this week only show candidates’ direct spending and fundraising, outside groups play a significant role, too, by either propping up or ignoring congressional races. National Republican groups have essentially abandoned Southern Nevada’s House races this year after their millions in investments two years ago resulted in no seat pickups. Republicans have only spent about $170,000 in ads in the three House races — almost exclusively bankrolled by the campaigns themselves — while Democrats have spent more $18 million on ads in the three contests, according to ad-tracking firmAdImpact. Click through the graphic below to see the specific fundraising numbers for each race. Rosen’s $12.1 million haul in the third quarter was by far her best fundraising performance to date, besting herrecord-setting$7.6 million haul in the second quarter. It still trailed Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-NV) $15 million total in the third quarter of 2022, after which Cortez Masto won her re-election campaign by less than 1 percentage point, the smallest margin in any Senate race nationwide. Meanwhile, Brown raked in about $8.5 million, also by far his best performance this cycle after heraised $4 millionin the second quarter. Rosen’s haul brings her total money raised this cycle to more than $35 million, the sixth-highest amount of eight Democrats running in competitive Senate races. Rosen has consistently led in polls against Brown, and her contest is considered more likely to remain in Democratic hands than many of the other swing races. Cook Political Report, an election forecaster, hasratedthe seat as “Lean Democratic.” Her fundraising advantage has allowed her to dominate the airwaves — but Brown is still putting up a fight. Democrats have already aired or reserved $79 million in ads to support Rosen, while the GOP has put up more than $45 million. In Nevada’s 2022 Senate race, Democrats had a roughly $20 million advantage in ad spending. As has been the case all cycle, many of Rosen’s donors came from California, Nevada and New York, with the most unique donors in Quarter 3 coming from California, according to aNevada Independentanalysis of itemized donations — typically those of at least $200. She had at least 100 unique donors in 28 states and Washington, D.C. Brown, meanwhile, had unique donors from 30 states in the third quarter. The most common states for donors were California, Nevada and Texas, which is where Brown used to live. 3rd Congressional District In Southern Nevada’s Congressional District 3 — the race thatelection forecasterssee as most competitive — Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) has a commanding fundraising lead. Lee raked in more than $1.2 million, the most of any House Democrat in Nevada, and nearly double the haul of her opponent, Republican tax analyst Drew Johnson. This is despite Johnson loaning his campaign $422,000, which made up about two-thirds of Johnson’s fundraising total. Johnson has loaned his campaign $722,000 this cycle. Lee also spent a staggering $2 million in the third quarter, compared with about $210,000 from Johnson. She has a roughly $1.8 million advantage in cash on hand. 4th Congressional District The other Republican candidate to make a significant loan to his campaign was former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, who is challenging Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) to represent the district sprawling across the northern Las Vegas Valley and center of Nevada. Lee loaned his campaign $500,000 in the third quarter — bringing his total amount of loans to more than $1 million — but it did little to chip into Horsford’s significant financial lead. Horsford raised $1 million in the quarter, much more than the roughly $686,000 raised by Lee, which includes his loan. Horsford also spent $1.5 million more than Lee and has about $1 million more in cash on hand. Read More: Once legislative colleagues, Steven Horsford, John Lee now squaring off for House seat 2nd Congressional District By far the biggest loan among House candidates came from Kidd, who has mounted a nonpartisan challenge to Amodei in Congressional District 2, which spans across Northern Nevada. Aside from Kidd’s $4 million loan to the campaign — which brought his total amount of self-loans to $5.5 million — he only raised $466. Still, the loan itself was more than enough to have a commanding financial lead over Amodei, who raised about $250,000. Kidd also spent $4 million, about 10 times as much as Amodei, who rarely faces competitive elections in his solid red district. Republicans are also behind in ad spending in the district because of Kidd’s self-funded campaign. Kidd has put more than $3 million into ads, while Amodei’s campaign has spent about $160,000, according toAdImpact. Read More: In Nevada’s only GOP House district, incumbent Amodei faces well-heeled indie challenge 1st Congressional District The tightest fundraising battle in the state’s four House races came in Southern Nevada’s Congressional District 1 — but it isn’t close there, either. Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) raised $539,000 in the third quarter, about $300,000 more than Republican Mark Robertson, a retired Army colonel. Titus also outspent Robertson by about $900,000 and has $650,000 more in cash on hand. The election is a rematch from two years ago, when Titus prevailed by more than 5 percentage points. Robertson has essentially been silent on the airwaves this cycle after national Republicans spent more than $7 million in ads on his behalf two years ago. He toldThe Indylast month that he is more confident in his chances this time around, in part because of GOP openness to early and mail voting. Robertson also loaned himself $79,000.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/website-linking-assembly-candidate-to-taliban-supporters-called-islamophobic,True,"A website launched last month by Republican Assembly candidate Brandon Davis alleges his Democratic opponent, Hanadi Nadeem, a practicing Muslim, supports and admires Taliban sympathizers — a message critics have decried as Islamophobic and xenophobic. Featuring mugshot-esque imagery,the websitepoints to Nadeem’s past comments on social media praising a former prime minister of Pakistan and the activities of Pakistani-American professional groups she’s worked with. It’s topped by the headline “Extreme Hanadi Nadeem” and a cutout of Nadeem wearing a hijab — something she doesn’t always wear. Davis' campaign placed signs with similar messaging in Las Vegas’ religiously diverse Summerlin-area Assembly District 34, calling Nadeem a “far left extremist” and “bad for Nevada.” The signs point back to the website. “This type of rhetoric, what he is doing, is really putting my life and my family and particularly the Muslim community in danger,” Nadeem said in an interview withThe Nevada Independent. “This is showing intolerance … He’s just grabbing stories from one side to another side and just trying to make the connection, but there’s no connection.” The criticism comes as Nevada has experienced a 75 percent rise inhate crimescompared to 2023, with more than 75 percent of the hate crimes focused on race or ethnicity and nearly 9 percent centered on religious bias. Nadeem, who is Pakistani American and has lived in Nevada for more than two decades, serves as a board member of the Nevada Equal Rights Commission. “I believe in promoting unity, equality and inclusiveness,” Nadeem said. “His behavior reveals his lack of understanding and respect for the diversity and contributions of all the communities of color.” Davis denied that the website is Islamophobic. “We sourced publicly available pictures on Mrs. Nadeem’s Facebook page. These are just pictures that were found,” Davis said. “There’s no focus in anything that we put forth to Mrs. Nadeem’s religious preference.” Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) described the website as “disgraceful campaign tactics” that are “dangerous and unacceptable.” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) also condemned the messagingon social mediaas “disgusting Islamophobic attacks.” “Let me be clear: Islamophobia has no place in our elections, in Nevada, or anywhere,” Cortez Masto said. “We’re proud to stand with Hanadi Nadeem and show her that Nevadans have her back.” Paromita Pain, an associate professor at UNR’s Reynolds School of Journalism, said that while it’s fair to assess candidates based on their social media support of causes and people, it’s also important to evaluate their day-to-day actions and the context surrounding the support. She said the website launched by Davis “plays on xenophobic and Islamophobic bias,” which can lead people to judge Muslims by the way they dress, such as viewing a woman who wears a burqa as more conservative and potentially leaning toward more extreme religious beliefs, even if that may not be true. “The best way to weigh [Nadeem’s] candidature is to carefully examine the work she has done, what she has achieved and how viable her future plans are,” Pain said. “Actions matter more than words, just as measurable positive results trump posts on social media.” Davis said he stands by the statement that Nadeem is “too extreme and too dangerous for the Nevada Assembly” because she has supported terrorist sympathizers. “As a voter, as a Nevadan, a father, somebody engaged in the community, I would say yes, somebody that publicly supports terrorist sympathizers could be an issue for our state,” he said. “We're simply just providing some factual information that is well documented, and making sure that voters in our district know about that information so they can make the right choice in this election.” A campaign spokesperson for Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who endorsed Davis in the race, did not respond to a request for comment about the website. The claims Davis’ accusations of support for Taliban sympathizers stem from two key arguments. The first is Nadeem’s public support on social media of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, who the website says “urged the world to support the Taliban.” She shared a post on Facebook last year featuring a picture of Imran Khan and a heart emoji. The websitelinks to an articlereporting Imran Khan said the world should support the new Taliban leaders in Afghanistan in 2021, instead of isolating them. The website also quotes Imran Khan as saying the Taliban had “broken the shackles of slavery (from the West).” Not mentioned on the website is the context contained within the same article that Khan was telling world leaders not to isolate Afghanistan and thereby spur more poverty in the country. Pain said Nadeem’s support of Imran Khan “needs to be examined in a very nuanced light,” because the former prime minister is greatly respected globally as a cricketing icon whose captaincy of the Pakistani cricket team led them to win the World Cup. She said Imran Khan becoming prime minister was looked on with hope, explaining that he was seen as having a Western, broad-minded perspective and viewed as someone who could make a positive difference. Pain noted, however, that in Pakistan, the military, not the prime minister’s office, has power. In the past, Imran Khan has alsosaidthat the “broken the chains of slavery” line was taken out of context, noting that he was speaking in Urdu and “talking about getting rid of mental slavery,” referring to the West’s cultural imposition via English language education. The website also notes that Imran Khan called Osama bin Laden, who organized the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11, a “martyr” andrefusedto call Bin Laden a terrorist during a TV interview. It also said he was “forced out of office after being arrested, charged, and convicted ofcorruptionandterrorism,” though those charges took place after he wasoustedfrom office during a time ofpolitical crisis. Pain said a piece of important context for these claims is that the independent nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations hasaddressedthe question of Pakistani officials cheering on the Taliban takeover by pointing out that Pakistan’s government and military “are not monolithic institutions, but rather groups with competing interests.” If an official doesn’t toe the line with the Pakistani military, she said, that can lead to imprisonment or worse. “Nadeem’s support of Imran Khan is not to be viewed in a dark light,” Pain said, adding that when evaluating social media support expressed by candidates, it’s vital to account for the level of support, the explanation for that support and the group or individual being supported. “Sometimes, when people are very young, they click or like something that is acceptable at that point in time but then later it comes back to haunt them,” she said. “The level of engagement is important. For example, did the person just like or retweet or repost content to show support or did they go all out posting new content in support, encouraging their friends and family and networks to repost and engage in depth?” Nadeem said she expressed support for the former prime minister because of his philanthropic work, which includes establishing acancer treatment hospitalthat serves patients regardless of their ability to pay. “His philanthropic side, his nature to help the poor, that is why I was supporting him as a philanthropist, as a leader who is helping the community,” Nadeem said, adding, however, that she condemned him for his support of Russia attacking Ukraine. She said she “strongly condemns” the Taliban and its restriction of women’s rights. Raised by a physician mother, she said her family upheld women’s empowerment and taught her to contribute to her community. The second part of the claims on the website are more tenuous, raising the question: “Is Hanadi Nadeem associated with Massod Khan, a terrorist sympathizer?” The website does not explicitly say that Nadeem is associated with Massod Khan, a former ambassador to the U.S. from Pakistan whose appointment was blocked because of“possible terror links” and who members of Congress have called a “bonafide terrorist sympathizer.” Instead, it lays a trail of breadcrumbs, highlighting Nadeem’s role as a board member of the Pakistan-American Political Action Committee (PAC), which has donated to candidates of both major parties and whose president held an event at his residence in 2023 that Massod Khan attended. It also said that Nadeem was president of the Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America (APPNA) Alliance, which hosted an event in 2023 where Massod Khan addressed attendees. Nadeem said she was president of APPNA Alliance in 2018 and did not work with the group after she served her term. She said APPNA Alliance may have hosted Khan because he was the U.S. ambassador then, but she didn’t have a role in the decision-making process and was not at either of the events referenced on the website. The website also says that Nadeem supports “alleged antisemitic, disgraced officials and widely unpopular establishment Democrats,” specifically calling out Nadeem’s donations to former Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-NV), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Democratic President Joe Biden and former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Asked whether the support of Kihuen was before news ofsexual harassment allegationscame to light and if donations to Clinton and Biden should disqualify candidates from running, Davis said he couldn’t speak to that. “What I can speak to is a presidential candidate that lost an election and another candidate that was wildly unpopular before deciding not to run again, and Mrs. Nadeem showing support for those individuals,” Davis said. “Drawing conclusions or putting together correlations inside of that, I can't speak to that.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/now-a-quarter-of-the-nevada-electorate-campaigns-hope-to-improve-margins-with-youth,True,"Happy hours. Movie nights. Parties. Campaigns and political parties are leaning in on events-based strategies to court young voters — who are notorious for low turnout especially relative to seniors — as mail ballots go out and early voting is set to begin Saturday. The Harris campaign is bringing younger surrogates to bars; the Trump campaign is having influencers open at rallies. In Nevada, more than 550,000 people younger than 35 are registered to vote, representing more than a quarter of the entire electorate, per the secretary of state’s September voter registration statistics. Voters younger than 25 make up nearly 11 percent of active registered voters. It’s a group whose net impact can — and has — swung elections. Campaigns of both parties have reason to believe that young voters will make up a critical part of their coalitions come November. The Harvard Institute of Politics’ national youth poll, released in September,foundthat Vice President Kamala Harris has a 31-point lead with voters younger than 30. But the Trump campaignbelievesyoung voters are worthy of outreach as well, and is focusing on young men and economic issues, which young voters, like the general electorate, consistently rank as their top priority. But as they deploy resources toward young voter outreach and canvassing, campaigns have to consider the age-old question about investing time in this demographic: Will they vote? Young votersregisteredtheir highest-ever turnout numbers in 2020. In Nevada, voters younger than 29 made up 18 percent of the electorate andpreferrednow-President Joe Biden by a 32-percentage-point margin — the benchmark Harris will be measured by. In the 2022 midterm, the Tufts Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that young voterschoseSen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) by a 21-percentage-point margin, delivering her 27,000 net votes en route to her victory by fewer than 8,000. Tufts CIRCLE alsofoundthat 24.5 percent of eligible voters younger than 29 turned out in Nevada — about average compared to other states and a slight dropoff from the 2018 midterm. Like Nevada as a whole, automatic voter registration has expanded the number of active registered young voters — and decreased each party’s vote share. In September 2020, voters younger than 35 were about 39 percent Democrat and 21 percent Republican.Today, Democrats only have 27 percent of the under-35 vote. But Republicans have not gained either, now encompassing 17 percent. Instead, about 48 percent of young voters — nearly half — are nonpartisan. While there are nearly 80,000 new young voters, much of that expansion owes to automatic voter registration and the explosion of nonpartisans, meaning campaigns have to decide whether to focus on registered members of their parties or try to recruit unaffiliated voters who are typically lower-propensity voters in an age group that already is low-propensity. Republicans — and the Trump campaign — are going after those voters across age groups. They’re trying to identify people who may have voted Republican in the past but don’t always vote. In particular, the campaign is homed in on young men. Former President Donald Trump hasappearedon numerous social media channels with figures whose audience skews younger and male — including podcaster Theo Von, YouTuber Logan Paul and streamer Adin Ross. The Trump campaign has had influencers speak at rallies and make pro-Trump content across various platforms. Harris, meanwhile, made apodcast appearanceof her own onCall Her Daddy, an advice podcast with a large contingent of young women listeners. And she’sreleasedsome economic policies geared specifically at younger voters, including $25,000 in down payment support for first-time homebuyers. Democrats believe their message continues to resonate with younger voters, especially on issues such as abortion and climate change — it’s just a matter of reaching them where they are and ensuring they vote. The Trump campaign is doubling down on the economy, working to tie cost-of-living concerns to the Democratic administration. In the state On the ground in Nevada, the Democratic Party is working to mobilize voters on college campuses and in young professional spaces. In conversations, they’re emphasizing abortion rights — a popular issue among Nevadans broadly — and down-payment assistance. And they’re trying to improve voter education on Biden initiatives that appeal to younger voters, including climate investments and efforts to cancel student loans. Those events can be happy hours, parties or putting together abortion aftercare kits, in the case of one Young Democrat event last December. “People think of Young Dems, and, at least in my experience, really thought that it was people sitting together and kind of just listening to panels,” said Maria Nieto Orta, the president of Young Democrats of Nevada. “Being part of the leadership group, to do these nontraditional, exciting events was really huge for me.” Much media coverage of college students has focused on campus protests against the Biden administration’s Israel policy. Anti-war campus protestsrockedcollege campuses in the spring. But organizers in Nevada don’t believe young voters are solely motivated by any single issue. “Young people as a whole have a lot of issues that they really care about,” said Tanner Hale, the executive director of Young Democrats of Nevada. And the Harris campaign points to polling showing its candidate switch has helped bring young voters critical of Biden — or just unenthusiastic about the election — back into the fold. Nieto Orta also said Harris’ personal story — and its appeal to young voters of color — should not be discounted. “At the [Democratic National Convention], when she spoke about her mom, she was describing her mom as a 5-foot brown woman with an accent,” she said. “My mom is a 5-foot brown woman with an accent. To see the possibility of seeing myself reflected in who will — fingers crossed — be our president, [has] kept me motivated.” To boost turnout, the state party and Harris campaign plans to host events at early voting locations near UNLV, College of Southern Nevada and Nevada State University in order to motivate young voters to turn out early. Much of their organizing has been themed around events, such as a happy hour earlier in the cycle with Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL), the youngest member of Congress, or aclimate forumwith Kennedy scion Jack Schlossberg. Even Republicans have acknowledged that issues such as abortion can be powerful motivators. Pauline Lee, president of the Nevada Republican Club, is working this cycle to turn out Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Republicans. She said young AAPI voters often have it ingrained in them that they should be Democrats, and it can be difficult to try and change minds. “Some of the younger Asian women, they've been kind of brainwashed in college about ‘my body, my vote,’” Lee said, referring to abortion. But she also believes that an economic argument can make headway with younger voters, particularly those who have struggled to find jobs or afford housing. Lee knows — she has three kids younger than 30. “They’re all saying the economy sucks,” Lee said. “They’re really unhappy.” Republican groups, meanwhile, are also trying to canvass the vote on college campuses. The Trump campaign has been tabling at UNLV every week, according to a campaign official, and has a significant contingent of young volunteers who engage in peer-to-peer voter contact through door-knocking and phone banking. The campaign has identified cost-of-living concerns as a chief motivator for college students, and wants to translate that into votes for Trump. Turning Point USA, the brainchild of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to recruit and mobilize young conservatives, has a chapter at UNR, where Kirkappearedlast week. The chapter said more than 300 voters showed up to the event. At UNLV, the College Republicans chapter has partnered with the Trump campaign, hosting digital game nights and in-person events such as movie nights and social mixers to reach voters. College Republican chapters at UNLV and UNR did not respond to interview requests. Nieto Orta acknowledged that young men, particularly young men of color, may be intrigued by Trump, but she believes voter education can help keep those voters in the Democratic camp. And she feels confident about the youth vote through the mechanism that Nevada Democrats have always relied on — superior organizing. “We know, specifically in Nevada, that knocking on people's doors and actually having that conversation is everything,” said Hale. “We especially learned in 2020 how there is no substitute for that. Republicans are just simply not knocking as many doors as we are.” This story was updated at 8:00 a.m. on 10/15/24 to correct Pauline Lee’s title.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-senate-district-11-candidates-dallas-harris-and-lori-rogich,True,"Democrats’ path to a supermajority in the Senate could run through a swingy southwestern Las Vegas Senate district, where a wealthy education advocate with deep family ties to Republican politicians is challenging an incumbent seeking her second full term. The path to victory forSen. Dallas Harris(D-Las Vegas) is complicated by the fact that the Culinary Union — a longtime force for getting Democrats elected — withdrew its endorsement of her and other sitting legislators because of their support for a bill ending a statutory mandate that hotel rooms be cleaned each day, and instead endorsed her Republican opponent, Lori Rogich. The swing district is located in a fast-growing area of the southwestern Las Vegas Valley, bounded by the 215 Beltway, Interstate 15 and Durango Drive. Registered Democratic voters (30 percent) outnumber registered Republican voters (25 percent), but nonpartisans make up a plurality of the district with nearly 38 percent of voters. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, said the union endorsed Rogich “because she is a better candidate.” He also cited Harris’ votes in 2023 against the union's efforts to introduce a state lottery, the room cleaning mandate and a union-backed public financing plan to support the establishment of a stadium for the Oakland Athletics in Las Vegas. Rogich said she would not vote to allow lotteries but would have supported the Oakland A’s stadium. Harris said state lotteries tend to put funding weight on lower-income communities without much public benefit. Born in Las Vegas, Harris received bachelor’s degrees from UNLV in computer science and psychology. She went on to receive her master’s in public policy from Claremont Graduate University in California and her law degree from The George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C. An attorney, Harris was first appointed in 2018 to replace then-Sen. Aaron Ford (D-Las Vegas). She is seeking re-election to a district she won with almost 59 percent of the vote in 2020. Raised by a single mother, Harris said she knows what it’s like when times get tough, an electric bill fluctuates and it’s hard to make rent. “There’s a lot of work to do to make the lives of Nevadans better,” she said. “I’m a grounded person who cares about ensuring that disparities are closed where they’re found.” Her Republican challenger owns the Rogich Law Firm and moved to Nevada about 20 years ago. Rogich holds a law degree from Rutgers University, which she earned while raising a child on her own, and is a regulatory compliance attorney focused on the cannabis industry. Rogich, who describes herself as a special needs advocate, fought a seven-year legal battle with the Clark County School District on behalf of her daughter. The case set a national legal precedent protecting children who have conditions such as dyslexia, autism and auditory processing challenges. She said Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, asked her to run as part of an effort to ensure that there is no one-party rule in the Legislature and to protect his ability to veto legislation. She said she views the role as a bipartisan one, with a focus on helping families. “It takes a bipartisan effort to make that change that many families want,” Rogich said. “It's an opportunity to continue to help people, and use my voice, use my experience and use my skills in order to do that.” Harris said approximately 90 percent of the bills she’s passed have been bipartisan and she believes in legislating across the aisle and finding consensus. She said the two bills she was most proud of in the 2023 legislative session were her bill toend sundown sirensand another measure implementing a retirement savings program, designed and administered by the state government, that helps those lacking access to workplace retirement plans. Harris has faced attacks this election cycle from the Lombardo-affiliated Better Nevada PAC, alleging that a bill Harris sponsored in 2023 would “make homeless camps like these legal in our neighborhoods.” The measure,SB142, sought to implement a“Homeless Persons’ Bill of Rights”that would guarantee any unhoused person the liberty to “use and move freely in or on public places"" to the extent of any other Nevadan. It did not pass out of the Legislature. Proponents of the measure said it would not invalidate any existing local ordinances, and it was designed to clarify the rights of people not living in a house. Rogich said she was a teenage mom who worked and attended college at night. She said she’s a hard worker, fighter and willing to use her skills and experiences to be the voice of families in the district. Rogich’s husband is Sig Rogich, who was the White House senior adviser to President George H.W. Bush from 1989 to 1992, and the communications and campaign adviser to President Ronald Reagan and Bush and presidential candidate Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). In 1974, he founded R&R Partners, the largest advertising and consultancy firm in Nevada, running numerous state and local political campaigns in Nevada in the 1970s and 1980s. Sig Rogich has also been the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, where he was born, and has a middle school in Summerlin named after him. Harris said she’s spent more time being a tenant than a landlord and an employee who receives a paycheck than as someone who writes one, and that experience in Carson City is invaluable. She added that one big difference between her and Rogich is who Rogich is married to. Though Lori Rogich has described herself as a political newcomer on her campaign website, Harris said, “you can’t be married to a former United States ambassador for the first George Bush and be a newcomer to politics.” “They’re involved in everything, things that I don’t even know about as a state senator,” she said. “Sig Rogich is pulling strings on so many things, and I think it’s a legitimate question to ask: Who would she be up there?” Harris said that people don’t have the same questions about her and who she represents. “I look forward to Election Day and being able to show that a people-powered campaign can, in fact, overcome monied interest and political clout,” Harris said. Rogich responded to the criticism by saying it is “always unfortunate when a person implies that a woman politician is controlled by her husband.”“I am a strong woman, and I worked hard for years to build a successful law firm, all while raising a family,” she said. “Shame on Dallas for trying to minimize another woman’s accomplishments."" Below, we explore Harris’ and Rogich’s views on a variety of key legislative issues.Click herefor the full list of questions we asked each candidate and their edited responses. Education School choice Reproductive rights Voter ID Mental health Housing Firearm policies Tax credits Education If she could wave a magic wand and make one specific policy change to Nevada’s education system, Harris said she would make sure it was fully funded and able to deliver a high-quality education to every student. She added that it’s vital for classrooms to be fully staffed, support staff to be properly paid, children to receive any specialized education they might need and that schools should not rely heavily on substitute teachers. As part of the goal to fully fund education, she said she supports bringing Nevada’s per-pupil education funding in line with the national average. The state’s per-pupil spending is an estimated average of $12,863, about $4,417 less than thenational average. Rogich said she would want to implement a universal screening process that would help identify struggling readers within the first 30 days of school. “There’s not anything in place that really can identify someone struggling,” Rogich said. “If you’re doing it universally, you may find a child that one would not perceive as struggling and catch them early.” She did not give a definitive yes or no to increasing per-pupil education funding to the national average but noted Nevada’s low ranking and said “it’s something that needs to always be part of the dialogue.” Both candidates largely aligned with their respective parties on whether to fund school meals for students regardless of household income. Rogich did not give a direct answer, but pointed out that more than 80 percent of Nevada students already qualify for free or reduced-price meals. Harris, who said she received free and reduced-price lunch growing up, said she would “without reservation” support funding for a universal school meal program. “[Offering universal school meals] is this ability to kind of equalize the school experience for all children,” she said. School choice Harris said she does not support providing state funding to subsidize private education. It was a view reinforced when, in 2023, Harrisreceived a valentinefrom school choice advocates that said, “No more CRT [Critical Race Theory] or LGBTQIA+ in our schools.” Harris said at the time that the message she received made her hesitant to agree to publicly fund schools that may havefewer guardrailsagainst anti-LGBTQ+ instruction than public schools. Parents have the prerogative to choose private schools if they want to allow their child to have a religious education, but she worries about injecting public dollars into private schools that don’t have to follow the same guidelines as public schools. She said alternative forms of education are available in the public education system, such as charter and magnet schools. But Harris said it’s important to her that students currently receiving Opportunity Scholarships are not disrupted and she is personally committed to ensuring every child who is currently on the program can remain on it. Rogich said she supports public education and subsidies for private education such as Opportunity Scholarships. Rogich said her daughter didn’t receive the education she was entitled to because of a learning disability, and the school district refused to accept their offer of paying to bring in trained experts to help teach their daughter. “We had that choice to pivot, put her in a private setting, but still continue to challenge the school district because they were wrong,” Rogich said. She added that she supports income caps and ensuring that funding for a school choice program does not reduce public school budgets. Reproductive rights Both candidates said they support measures protecting in vitro fertilization (IVF) and will vote “yes” on Nevada’s Ballot Question 6, a measure seeking to enshrine existing abortion protections in the Nevada Constitution. Harris said she would support a broader abortion rights initiative going through the Legislature that would protect a more expansive range of reproductive health services, including fertility treatments and access to birth control. Voter ID Harris does not support Question 7, which seeks to implement voter ID, saying she has not seen anything definitive showing voter ID requirements would make Nevada’s voting system safer. “I have seen lots of evidence that it would further impede people’s ability to vote,” she said. “The voter ID initiative coming forward is really a solution without a problem that might actually make voting a bit harder. And the unfortunate thing is, here in the United States, we’ve got an undervoting problem, not an over-voting problem.” Rogich said she supports voter ID, and there are many identification requirements in the U.S., including if someone flies on an airplane or enters a cannabis dispensary. Mental health Harris said since her first legislative session in 2019, she’s been pushing the state to establish a crisis response system that moves away from a criminal justice-centered response toward a mental health-centered response. “Mental health cannot be solved, and should not be addressed, in state prison systems and county jails,” Harris said. The other piece to addressing mental health, she said, is ensuring that there are more mental health providers and that they are diverse and Nevada-grown, which could mean investing in internship and training programs. Rogich said her first daughter died by suicide after battles with depression, and she wants to see adequate services in place, such as state-of-the-art mental health facilities. Housing Harris said the most effective solution to the state’s housing crisis is either gaining a veto-proof supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature or finding a way to work with the governor, who vetoed a large swath of housing bills the Legislature passed last year. “We’ve got to get something done,” Harris said. “I believe that the governor has great ideas about opening up supply, but that’s not going to do it. We’ve got to do more.” She wants to ensure the state’s most vulnerable citizens are not being price gouged, that assistance is available for people when they need it, and that the eviction process works for landlords and tenants. Rogich said it’s important to streamline the permitting process to open up opportunities for developers so they can increase the state’s housing supply. She said it’s also important to invest in bringing older homes up to livable standards. Harris said Nevada’s rapidsummary eviction process, in which a tenant must make the first filing in an eviction case, is out of step with a majority of other states. She supported a measure in 2023 that would have made it so landlords filed first, but it was vetoed. “At bare minimum, that is one reform that we should take another hard look at,” Harris said. Though Rogich said she supports Lombardo’s veto of the summary eviction change, she noted that eviction should be a last resort. “The state’s summary eviction process tries to balance the interests of landlords in maintaining their property and investments and the interests of tenants in securing stable housing,” she said. “However, this balance is delicate, and we must continue to find ways to implement pre-court intervention programs for families at risk of eviction.” Firearm policies In 2023, Lombardovetoedthree gun control measures proposed by Democrats. Harris, who proposed one of the three bills that was vetoed, described her measure as a “classic example of what conservatives say they would support when it comes to gun violence prevention legislation.”The bill would have prevented someone who was convicted of a hate crime within the past 10 years from purchasing a gun. Data from the state indicates hate crimes haveincreased 75 percentsince 2023. Another measure that was included would have raised the legal age to purchase certain semiautomatic rifles and shotguns to 21, as well as closed a legal loophole in the state’s 2021 attempt to ban so-called “ghost guns.” Harris said the law had plenty of carve-outs for people who had military training and was aimed at addressing the use of assault weapons in mass shootings by people under the age of 21,which has been a trend in the U.S. “We've shown that our society suffers when young folks who just maybe are not ready for these weapons get their hands on them,” she said. Harris said she stands by her support of the third bill, which would have criminalized bringing a gun within 100 feet of an election site. “This is America,” Harris said. “Voting is the most fundamental piece of our democracy. If anyone feels threatened to vote, we have all failed.” Rogich said she supports Lombardo’s vetoes on these measures but supports mandatory prosecutions when individuals prohibited from possessing firearms purchase or possess them. Tax credits Harris, who voted against a public financing deal to build a stadium for the Oakland A’s in Las Vegas, said she stands by her decision. “As far as I’m concerned, the evidence suggests that public[ly] funded stadiums do not generate a substantial return for the governments that invest in them,” she said. “I didn’t think this was a good deal for the state.” Rogich said she would have supported the legislation, citing the number of jobs the project is expected to create. “It’s not just constructing it, but it’s also the affiliated services,” she said. On a proposed expansion of film tax credits, Harris said she has not yet seen a bill, and the details matter. But she would approach such a bill with an open mind when it arrives. Rogich said she would be open to considering expanding the state’s film tax credit system, but she would need to evaluate how the proposal would benefit communities and the state of Nevada.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/seaman-seeks-promotion-to-las-vegas-mayor-after-five-years-on-the-council,True,"Lifelong Democrat Bryce Henderson stood out among the many Trump gear-wearing attendees at a Las Vegas Mediterranean restaurant who were celebrating Victoria Seaman finishing in second place in the June mayoral primary and advancing to the general election. His support for Seaman, a Republican, stemmed from the Las Vegas city councilwoman’s effortsto resolve issues surroundingThe Animal Foundation of Las Vegas in 2023 that he said officials long ignored. He figured Seaman would, too, but a year earlier, she paid a“surprise visit” to the facilityand used the word “horrible” to describe the conditions. “She’s proven me wrong in so many ways,” Henderson said recently. “Victoria always meets with small-business owners and she is at every function. Victoria wants to make the city better. That’s the type of person we need as mayor.” Seaman, 65, is in the middle of her first full four-year term as councilwoman for Ward 2, which covers much of the western and southwest areas of the city, including Summerlin. A former one-term Republican assemblywoman, she was first elected to the council in 2019 to finish the term of a councilman who resigned, and — in a nonpartisan race that has markedly partisan undertones — is now running as the underdog to a former Democratic congresswoman to become the first Las Vegas mayor in 25 years without the name Goodman. “I spent time trying to understand everything about civic government,” she said as a reason why she’s running for mayor. “I believe we need someone who has institutional knowledge of city government to continue moving forward.” She is now running to lead the city that she has twice sued. One case was settled; she recovered medical costs for a car accident in an unmarked section of a road construction zone. The second lawsuit — for injuries and mental anguish from a well-publicized altercation with former Councilwoman Michele Fiore — is still pending. Seaman faces a formidable challenge in front-runnerShelley Berkley, who served 14 years as a Democratic congresswoman representing a district that included a large portion of the City of Las Vegas. Berkley, 73, finished ahead of Seaman in the 15-candidate primary by almost 7 percentage points. The 2024 election marks the first time sincea 2019 legislative changethat the nonpartisan mayor’s race is on the same ballot as the president and the U.S. Senate campaign, both highly partisan affairs. However, with Seaman’s Republican background and Berkley’s long-standing ties to the Democratic Party, the campaign has taken on a partisan demeanor. The most recent voter registration numbers provided by the Clark County Election Department show a Democratic lean: the city of Las Vegas had about 133,000 registered Democrats, roughly 101,000 Republicans, and more than 165,000 registered as nonpartisans or with other parties. The winner replaces term-limited Mayor Carolyn Goodman, who succeeded her husband, mob lawyer Oscar Goodman. He began the family’s hold on the office in 1999. Neither of the Goodmans has announced an endorsement for either candidate. “I think the Goodmans have done a great job and there's no doubt they have done many good things. But we’re in a different time,” Seaman toldThe Indyin an interview last month at her Summerlin home. She was critical of how Carolyn Goodman handled thelong-running land-use disputesurrounding the defunct Badlands golf course that could cost taxpayers upward of $450 million to $650 million. “I don't think she [Goodman] did the right thing when it came to Badlands,” Seaman said. Sincebefore taking office, Seaman made the dispute a key issue, advocating for the city to settle the matter and end the fight with developers who planned to turn the golf course at Alta Drive off Rampart Boulevard into a housing development. In August, she wasthe only councilmemberto vote against paying outside lawyers $500,000 to continue to advise the city on the matter. Settling the Badlands matter is one campaign issue where Seaman and Berkley agree. However, they disagree on what steps to take to end the fight. Berkley lives in the Queensridge community, which is bisected by Badlands. “I believe the city needs a strong leader. We don’t need the status quo,” Seaman said. “I’ve never stopped and asked, ‘Oh, how will this look?’ This is why I got elected. This is a job I want to do.” Las Vegas City Councilman Brian Knudsen, who has endorsed Berkley, took umbrage with Seaman’s remarks on Badlands, saying all the council members have sought to resolve the matter, but said the developer has no interest in a settlement. “We’ve all advocated to settle and [Seaman and I] have been on the council the same amount of time,” Knudsen toldThe Nevada Independent. “That’s why I put it on the public record.” Former Republican Gov. Bob List, now an attorney and lobbyist, said he first met Seaman during her time in Carson City. List became an early backer after telling him she was entering the race. “We've stayed in touch over the years and I've watched her work on the city council,” said List, who was Nevada governor from 1979 to 1983. “I have a great deal of admiration for her. She loves the city and she loves her constituency, and she's just tireless.” A California transplant change Seaman was born in California and grew up in the Los Angeles area. On her campaign website, she mentions being a descendant of José Antonio de la Guerra y Noriega, a “Californio” (Hispanic Californian) who was a landowner, politician and military officer with ties to Santa Barbara. She moved to Las Vegas in 2005 and earned real estate and business broker licenses in Nevada. According to herLinkedIn page, Seaman previously owned several day spas and a line of bath, body and skin care products, businesses that have since been sold. “I left LA because of the policies and I didn't believe that people in government understood small business and the challenges that we had to go through,” Seaman said, adding that she planned to back candidates “who signed the front of a paycheck and understood small business.” In her2015 legislative biography, Seaman said she earned an associate degree in political science at the College of Southern Nevada, and a bachelor’s degree in urban studies with a minor in family studies from UNLV. Seaman said her outspokenness on Badlands and her efforts to resolve issues surrounding The Animal Foundation motivated her to enter the mayor’s race. “We're a huge city now. We need someone who's not going to care about their next election and do the right thing,” Seaman said. At aNevada Independentmayoral candidate forumon Sept. 25, Seaman said her experiences in dealing with government, including taxes and over-regulation, is what drove her to get into politics and ultimately led her to run for mayor. “I've been on the council for five years. It's supposed to be a part-time position that I've done as a full-time job,” Seaman said. She added that local government differs greatly from the Legislature because the job brings her closer to her constituents. “You can actually get things done,” she said. Seaman cited the city’s rapid growth, homelessness, affordable housing and public safety as many of the issues she would tackle as mayor. Seaman stated during the mayoral forum that crime is on the rise in Southern Nevada even when shown news reports of declining numbers for burglaries and nonviolent crimes. On housing, she committed to “ensuring that builders and developers will have the tools and incentives they need to significantly expand affordable housing opportunities within our community.” To address homelessness, Seaman worked with the governor's office to replicate Haven for Hope, a San Antonio, Texas-based transformational homeless campus, in Las Vegas. One of her accomplishments since taking office is resolving issues with The Animal Foundation. Seaman leda surprise visit and inspectionof the nonprofit facility in September 2022 following reports of poor conditions at Las Vegas’ primary animal shelter that is overseen by the cities of Las Vegas and North Las Vegas, as well as Clark County. Seaman called the shelter “appalling,” adding it smelled of feces from the kennels in an intake area where animals were kept after being found overnight. Foundation officials said Seaman showed up before the shelter was open and that the power to inspect it does not belong to her. They said the shelter is routinely subjected to random checks by county and city inspectors, something they welcome. Animal Foundation CEO Hilarie Grey — who lost a 2019 city council election to Seaman — said at the time that the councilwoman’s visit was “nothing more than a political stunt, and not an indication of anything.” In December 2023, the city councilunanimously approvedreforms to the facility. “The Animal Foundation was a decades-old problem that nobody would touch,” said Seaman, who is pictured on her website with two of her four dogs. “I took the lead on that issue.” A foundation spokesperson declined to comment about Seaman’s role in improving conditions at the animal shelter. Legal matters In 2017, two years before Seaman was elected to the city council, she and her husband, John, sued the city and three contractors after they were injured in a one-car accident in 2015. The Seamans alleged serious injury after their 2014 Honda Accord, driven by John with Victoria in the passenger seat, drove into an improperly marked section of excavated road. The casewas settled in 2019for $100,000 without the use of taxpayer money. In January 2021, Seaman and Fiore were involved in a physical altercation that left her with a broken finger. Seaman filed a lawsuitin September 2022seeking upward of $15,000, payment for medical expenses and “general damages for pain, suffering, mental distress, anguish and fear.” According to the lawsuit, Fiore violently attacked Seaman, grabbing her hand and “​​pulling, jerking, twisting, and breaking … Seaman’s finger in a violent manner.” City Hall surveillance videos that captured the physical altercationwere deleted, theLas Vegas Review-Journalreported in 2021. “That a public servant could stoop to the level that she did to attack me was very humiliating,” Seaman said. “I didn't have support from the city and that was part of the reason to go forward with a lawsuit. I was in fear for my life.” Fiore did not seek re-election to the city council in 2022 and ran a losing campaign for state treasurer. She was later appointed as a justice of the peace in Nye County. However, on Oct. 3, Fiorewas convicted by a juryon seven federal wire fraud charges for using donations intended for a fallen police officer’s statue for personal gain. Seaman, along with Gov. Joe Lombardo, were listed as donors defrauded by Fiore. Seaman did not testify in the trial and said she couldn’t discuss the case. Embarking on a political career Seaman’s interest in politics began in 2012 through a friendship with Danny Tarkanian, who ran several close but unsuccessful House campaigns as a Republican and is now a Douglas County commissioner. Seaman said she was introduced to Tarkanian by an acquaintance. “He was a small-business owner, and I went and volunteered for him,” Seaman said. “Eventually I got very involved in the political system and got recruited and ran for office.” In the “red wave” of 2014, Seaman won a two-year term as a Republican to represent Southern Nevada’s Assembly District 34, which covers much of Summerlin. She won with 56.2 percent of the vote after her Democratic opponent was declared ineligible by a judge for not meeting the district’s residency requirements. The court ordered signs posted notifying voters that she was ineligible, but it was too late in the process to remove her name from the ballot. During her only legislative session, Seaman sponsored several pieces of legislation, including two bills that were signed by the governor — the issuance ofspecial license platesindicating support for Second Amendment rights and giving police the legal authority toremove squattersfrom occupying a dwelling without permission. Other bills she sponsored — including one toallow concealed weapons on college campusesand another torequire voter ID— failed to become law. Two years later, Seaman ran as a Republican for the open state Senate District 6 seat. She lost by 1,100 votes to Democrat Nicole Cannizzaro, who is now the Senate’s majority leader. In 2018, Seaman was one of 10 GOP candidates running for the 3rd Congressional District when Tarkanian entered the race at the request of President Donald Trump.Seaman withdrewa week later. “The Tarkanians have been family friends for years, and attacking one another will only hurt each other’s families, and lead to a blue win in November,” Seaman said at the time. Seaman joined the city council in 2019 when she topped a field of eight candidates for the Ward 2 seat vacated by Steve Seroka, who resigned amid a recall campaignSeaman spearheadedabout his handling of the Badlands issue. Seaman collected nearly 3,000 votes — 39.6 percent of the overall total in that race. Three years later, Seaman won a full four-year term in a landslide. In the mayor’s race, Berkley has been endorsed by four of the councilmembers — Knudsen, Olivia Díaz, Nancy Brune, and most recently,Cedric Crear, who finished third in the mayoral primary with almost 19 percent. When asked about Berkley’s council endorsements, Seaman said it would “create a rubber stamp” should Berkley win. “I don't think that's healthy. I think we have to debate,” Seaman said. “We don't get elected to get along. We get elected to do the people's work.” Knudsen said his relationship with Seaman “has always been cordial,” but “it makes total sense to me why none of us have endorsed her.” GOP support According to Seaman’s campaign website, nearly two dozen past and present elected officials have endorsed her race for mayor, including Republicans Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony, state Controller Andy Matthews, former Clark County Commissioner Bruce Woodbury and former Attorney General Adam Laxalt. Seaman also touts support from Lombardo, although the Republican governor isn’t included on the list. Lombardo was one of several hosts for a Seaman fundraiser in September at Red Rock Resort but did not attend. According to Seaman's April campaign filing report, Lombardo's Nevada Way PAC contributed $5,000 to her mayoral campaign on Feb. 1. “While Gov. Lombardo doesn't typically endorse in non-partisan races, his contribution and fundraising support speaks for itself,” a spokesperson for the governor said in an email. List, one of the former GOP elected officials who have endorsed Seaman, said “Victoria brings some new thinking to city hall. She's been absolutely right on this Badlands issue. She’s also been very good on public safety.” Seaman’s husband is a former government law enforcement officer who, following his retirement, helped her build the skin care products business. She touts her support from law enforcement, having been endorsed by more than a dozen Nevada police organizations, including the Las Vegas Police Protective Association (LVPPA), the union that represents some 4,000 active and retired members of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Several of the other law enforcement groups don’t have ties to Las Vegas or Clark County. LVPPA President Steven Grammas said Seaman earned the group’s backing because her “policies on policing and thoughts on police officers has really aligned with us.” He added that Seaman “has always been an advocate for law enforcement, which she has shown through time by her votes.” As of June 30, according to their campaign contribution and expense reports, Berkley had outraised Seaman by more than $100,000. Seaman reported about $412,000 in contributions while Berkley has brought in nearly $518,000. Berkley is using a majority of her funds for television advertising, having reserved $445,000 worth of airtime, according todata from AdImpact. Seaman said she didn’t budget dollars for television advertising and was focusing on other campaign efforts. “In the general [election], with the presidential and Senate races, unless you have a million dollars, you might as well set [your money] on fire,” she said. Seaman’s husband of 20 years has knocked on more than 12,000 doors since the campaign began. She said her daughter, who lives part-time in France, came back to Las Vegas in early October to help with the grassroots effort. Would remain on the council While settling the Badlands dispute tops her goals, Seaman said she was hopeful the developer would come up with a plan that would satisfy all the stakeholders, including nearby residents. “The land is worth a lot of money, and there are developers that are very interested in it,” Seaman said. “Sadly, we're here, but we have to now move forward and find a way to make sure that the taxpayers aren't on the hook.” Seaman said another of her goals is to bring a standalone children’s hospital to Las Vegas. If Seaman loses to Berkley, she said she will continue to serve as the Ward 2 councilwoman until 2026. She said nothing would change in how she handles her position. “I'll just continue representing the people and leading in my capacity because that's what I was elected to do,” Seaman said. “That's what I'm passionate about and I think the constituents deserve that.” Updated at 3:12 p.m. on 10/16/2024 to reflect a campaign contribution from Gov. Joe Lombardo's political action committee. Updated at 9:42 a.m. on 10/13/2024 to correct Seaman's age, educational background and the status of a homeless center. ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/at-north-las-vegas-roundtable-trump-paints-himself-as-bringer-of-latino-prosperity,True,"Just two days after Vice President Kamala Harris hosted a town hall geared towards Latino voters, former President Donald Trump had his own roundtable discussion in North Las Vegas on Saturday, arguing Latinos were better off under his leadership and that those running the country now are “very stupid and probably evil.” In roughly 15 minutes of remarks as he was flanked by some small business owners, Trump described “a nation in decline,” zeroing in on fears about the rising cost of living, unauthorized immigration and drug trafficking in front of an audience that organizers estimated to be about 500 attendees. Supporters who spoke during the roundtable included Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown, Goya Foods CEO Robert Unanue, and businessman and Assembly candidate Rafael Arroyo, all of whom lauded Trump’s economic platform. Several participants pointed to the need for community members to hold multiple jobs to survive as a reason to vote Republican. Trump’s latest visit to Vegas comes on  the heels of aFriday rally in Reno. The Saturday event was hosted by Building America’s Future,a conservative political action committeestarted in 2022 that has attacked the Biden administration platform on illegal immigration, and has received millions of dollars from Tesla founder Elon Musk. “I think this is going to be the biggest and most important election in the history of the United States,” Trump said. “The Hispanic people have been tremendous.” In the home stretch of the presidential race that’s neck and neck, both Harris and Trump have ramped up efforts to reach Nevada’s Latino voters — who could prove key to winning the swing state and its six electoral votes. About 20 percent of the state's registered voters are Latino, and nearly half of them don’t belong to either major party, according to theNALEO Education Fund,a Latino political group. Although Harris is outperforming Trump among Latinos (51 percent to 39 percent), according to a SeptemberTelevisa/Univisionpoll, Trump appears poised to improve his margins with the group, especially with Spanish speakers. Trump boasted that he was getting “numbers of Hispanic Americans that nobody ever thought possible.” “It's an incredible group of people. It's an honor to have you on my side,” he said. Many of the community members who spoke at the event were first-generation immigrants and identified as former Democrats, but said that their economic prospects suffered under the Biden Administration and they came to support Trump as a result. Insurance agent Linda Fornos, who spoke at the roundtable, said that she voted for Biden in 2020, but recently threw her support behind Donald Trump. Fornos, who immigrated from Nicaragua more than a decade ago, lamented the economic situation, saying her son wanted to be part of the roundtable but couldn’t afford to miss work. “I ask to everyone, what [Democrats] have done to us? Nothing. They have done nothing,” she said. Fact checkers sayLatinos fared similarlyunder Biden and Trump, with one expert calling it “a tie.” They fared better under Biden on inflation-adjusted wages, homeownership and health insurance coverage; they fared better under Trump on the poverty rate and inflation-adjusted household income. Voterssay they trust Trump more than Harrison border issues; the former president has pledged to conduct a mass deportation campaign if elected. Throughout his speech, he repeatedly derided therecord-breaking number of unauthorized border crossingsduring the Biden administration, calling the situation at the border “the worst ever in the history of the world” and saying illegal immigration is an economic threat to Latinos whose prosperity grew during his term. It’s “being taken away from you by them, because of the border, because people are going to come in, they're going to take your job,” Trump said. Economistspush back on this claim, saying the roles immigrant workers are taking are generally ones that native-born U.S. citizens are unwilling to take, such as farm work and food processing jobs. Trump also repeatedly attempted to woo union members during his speech, touting his proposal to end taxes on tips. He cited poll results that indicated that60 percent of Teamsters in Nevadasupported him, although the national chapter declined to endorse a candidate, and Nevada’s chapter recently endorsed Harris. Brian Ursua, a Teamsters Local 631 member, came out in favor of Trump during the roundtable, highlighting the former president’s stance against taxing tips, saying it would help the “Teamsters out tremendously.” The majority of those he works with want Trump back in office, Ursua said. “I remember when you were in office the economy was booming,” Ursa told Trump. “We were able to live the American Dream.” Ursua — a Christian — also espoused Trump’s values, asserted that Americans “respected” authority during his term and that the southern border and local communities were safer then. The narrow miss during an attempted assassination this summer was an act of divine intervention, he contended. Brown and Arroyo also spoke briefly at the event. Brown, who is trailing his opponent Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV),attacked the Democratic senator over the growth in her wealth during the Biden administration. He called on the women in the audience to get out to vote for him, saying that they were key to a potential win over Rosen. As the event ended, Trump made a similar pitch to the audience. “Get out to vote,” he said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-nevada-focus-group-nonpartisan-men-of-color-supportive-of-abortion-protections,True,"Asked in a recent focus group what he thinks about abortion, one 60-year-old Nevada man expressed his frustration that his opinion was even in play. “What goes on between a woman and a child has nothing to do with me. I just need to mind my own business,” he said. This “none of my business” attitude reflected the overall tone of a focus group on abortion held in late September by Navigator Research, a consortium of pollsters led by Global Strategy Group, one of the largest Democratic polling firms in the U.S. In an hourlong conversation over Zoom, a group of five men of color (all are nonpartisans) living in Nevada expressed their concerns about eroding reproductive rights and political polarization, with each participant expressing that it should be up to an individual woman to decide whether she should have an abortion. Their names have been omitted at the request of focus group organizers so they could freely express their feelings during the session. Through the focus group, officials with Navigator Research said that they wanted to better understand how Black and brown men respond to key issues and messages, calling them “difference-makers” and some of the “most critical parts of the electorate.” The men all agreed thatthe 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade— which sparked a wave of state abortion restrictions throughout the country — has limited women’s reproductive freedom and is symptomatic of a democracy in jeopardy. They also expressed concerns about abortion access in Nevada, saying the cost —up to $800for a medication abortion, according to Planned Parenthood — is too high. And they worried aloud about access to the procedure in the state, although abortion remains legal here up until 24 weeks. This year, abortion is also on Nevada’s ballot, a move that the men welcomed. Ballot Question 6 would buildon existing protectionsby enshrining abortion rights in the Nevada Constitution if passed. The question would need to be approved in 2026 as well before the Constitution is amended. One participant in his late 20s said he felt that crackdowns on abortion following Roe v. Wade’s overturning has made the issue even more difficult to discuss. “The public discourse makes it harder to talk about,” he said. “Kind of brought us back to the stone ages.” A significant chunk of the men, however, said that they believe that abortions remain fairly accessible in the state. The morning after pill — a type of emergency contraception — and other forms of birth control such as IUDs remain widely available, assuaging some of their concerns about access to reproductive care. Some said they’ve accompanied friends and loved ones to clinics for abortions as well. Most of the participants in the group expressed hesitancy about Vice President Kamala Harris’ candidacy, even though she has championed reproductive rights and has been able toconsolidate Black and Latino support, especially those who soured on Biden. They felt that as vice president, she should’ve already been able to implement some of her political promises about protecting civil rights and bettering the economy. “I think Democrats protect abortion, but Harris is definitely a follower, so she's taking leads from other people in the Democratic Party. It's really not good,” said another participant in his 60s. That hesitance aside,a September pollfrom Howard University shows that some 82 percent of Black swing state voters say they’ll vote for Harris. The group also soured on former President Donald Trump, with one participant calling him “destructive.” Although Trump has declined to endorse a national abortion ban, he’s also courted anti-abortion groups, calling himself the “most pro-life president in American history.”Meanwhile, Project 2025 — the 900-page playbook from former Trump aides and the conservative Heritage Foundation — proposes entirely banning emergency contraception. The focus group, however, remains hopeful that abortion will remain accessible in Nevada.“We're in the middle of election season, so we'll see what happens in the next four years, but everything seems like it's good right now,” said one participant, who is in his late 20s.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/four-takeaways-from-trumps-rally-in-reno,True,"In his latest visit to the Silver State, former President Donald Trump promised Nevadans relief on their energy bills, described an aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration and called Nov. 5 the “most important day in the history of our country.” “I’m putting everything on the line to fight for you, and I am also only asking you for one thing: Vote. Get out and vote,” Trump said in his opening remarks at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno Friday evening, emphasizing that mail voting is already underway in Nevada and it’s important to vote Republican at every level “to turn around our country so fast.” The message comes with a week until early voting begins and less than a month until Election Day in the Silver State, which is squarely among the states whose electoral votes could determine the winner of the presidential race. In the nearly 90-minute wide-ranging speech to a packed crowd in the casino’s main ballroom, Trump also lobbed numerous criticisms against Vice President Kamala Harris and hammered home messaging on the economy, promising to cut energy prices in half and reiterating promises to not tax overtime pay and implement a “no tax on tips” policy — an idea he first floated at aLas Vegas rallyin mid-June, saying a waiter at his property on the Stripgave himthe idea. Trump also addressed back-to-back hurricanes that have hit the East Coast in recent weeks, which have led to widespread environmental destruction and questions about which presidential candidate wouldbest address natural disasters. “I want to send our love to all of the people back east who are recovering from two really devastating hurricanes,” Trump said. “Our hearts are with those who lost a loved one, and we are with you all of the way.”He added that it’s important to get “better help from a thing called the federal government” and criticized Harris for the response to the disaster. In the wake of the storms, the Biden administrationhas focused oncombating misinformation, warning that the former president’s rhetoric could lead to unfounded fears that the government is not working to address the crisis. Here areThe Nevada Independent’s four main takeaways from Friday’s rally. The presidential race is a toss-up The event marked Trump’s first appearance in Reno sincelast Decemberas he barnstorms across the country in the final month of the presidential race. Most recently, Trump held arally in Las Vegaslast month and will return to Southern Nevada on Saturday for a roundtable with Hispanic voters alongside Sam Brown, the GOP nominee for U.S. Senate. His visit comes after Harris held atown hallin Las Vegas on Thursday, and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), was inReno on Monday. Democratic former President Barack Obama isscheduled to rallyfor Harris in Las Vegas the day early voting begins. Polls show a dead heat between Trump and Harris in the Silver State, though he received his best polling results Friday after aWall Street Journalpollfound him besting Harris by 6 percentage points here. Almost all otherrecent nonpartisan pollshave found both candidates separated by a couple of percentage points, well within the margin of error. At the beginning and end of his speech, Trump underscored the stakes of the upcoming election, urging attendees to cast a ballot. “With your vote in this election, we will quickly defeat inflation, and we will make America affordable again,” he said, focusing parts of his speech on seniors, gun owners and evangelicals, and warning about “disastrous radical Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen,” who is known as amoderate in the closely divided Senate. Trump calls for drilling and fracking Trump leaned into a promise he’s been making in recent weeks to slash Americans’ energy costs in half within a year of taking office — a commitment observers say appeals to consumers grappling with inflation but that may belargely out of his controlto accomplish. Lowering energy prices is also an appeal that Nevada’s only Republican congressman, Rep. Mark Amodei, hasused in his re-election campaign. Trump promised on day one to “unleash American energy,” adding that the U.S. has “liquid gold under our feet” and there’s potential for energy independence through fracking — the process of drilling and extracting oil and gas from rock formations. “We will quickly become energy independent, as we were before, and make America the dominant energy producer in the world by far,” he said. “We will frack, frack, frack and drill baby drill.” Trump accused Harris of wanting to ban fracking and “anything to do with fossil fuels.” In 2019, as a senator, Harrissaidshe would ban fracking, but has changed her position since joining Biden on the 2020 ticket. Trump allies say the president could ease rules around permitting and open up more leases for oil and gas, although experts also point out that lowering the price of oil too muchcan make it unprofitablefor companies to drill in the first place. Nevada producesnominal amounts of oil, and some efforts at development have hit fierce opposition. When the state had the option to lease land in the Ruby Mountains for oil and gas development in 2019 under Trump’s administration, the U.S. Forest Servicedenied the requestamid pressure from environmental groups and public outcry. Trump also criticized the Biden administration’s push toward cleaner vehicles. In March, the Biden administration implemented a rule that could vastly increase the sales of affordable electric vehicles, making electric and battery-powered cars a majority of those manufactured and making gas-powered cars just29 percent of the new car marketin 2032. Though Trump called it an “insane mandate” that he would remove, the rule does not directly impose electric vehicle quotas. Rather, itsets pollution standardsfor automakers that would be hard to achieve without developing electric or low-carbon vehicles. Trump claims union support In his speech, Trump claimed strong union support for his campaign, citingpoll resultshis campaign has promoted indicating that nearly 60 percent of Teamsters union members in Nevada are backing him, with only about 37 percent support for Harris. Though the main national body of the Teamsters union declined to endorse a presidential candidate in the upcoming election, Nevada’s Teamsters union chapterendorsedthe vice president, saying, “[Teamsters] deserve a committed administration that will relentlessly advocate for their rights, ensure their safety, and prioritize the needs of working people.” Despite the national Teamsters not endorsing in the race, Trump claimed that the union endorsed him. “Traditionally, they go Democrat, but we got — all over the nation they endorsed Trump, along with the police along with the firefighters,” he said. He also said if elected, there will be large tax cuts for workers, especially Nevadans. He vowed not to tax overtime pay or tips — a promise that Harris and Trump have made in an effort to court members of Nevada’s hospitality industry Although the state’s politically powerful Culinary Union has advocated for ending taxes on tips, ithas called Trumpan unserious messenger attempting to curry favor with voters and endorsed Harris for president. In discussing unions, Trump also leaned on fears surrounding illegal immigration, saying that undocumented immigrants are “going to take a lot of union jobs away,” without any evidence. Immigration and border reform Trump zeroed in on immigration — an issue high on voters’ priority list and one on which voterssay they trust Trump more than Harris— alleging that about 20 million people crossed the border during the Biden-Harris administration. Fact checkers, however, have said that the source of his data is “unclear.” Reports from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection indicate that since 2021, agents across the country have had more than7.3 million encounterswith migrants trying to illegally cross into the United States. Trump also promised to strengthen the border and prosecute and use the death penalty “for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement official.” As part of a crackdown on illegal immigration, he said he would “round up illegal alien gang members” and put them in jail or throw them out of the country “until not a single one is left.” The penalty for anyone returning he said, would be an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. “We don’t want them to come back,” Trump said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/obama-to-rally-for-harris-in-las-vegas-on-oct-19,True,"Former President Barack Obama will come to Las Vegas on Oct. 19 — the first day of early voting in Nevada — to rally for Vice President Kamala Harris. It is the popular Democrat’s first campaign-related trip to Nevada of the cycle. Obama will stump for Harris and down-ballot Democrats and encourage early voting, the Harris campaign said. The former president held arallyin Pittsburgh on Thursday night, the first ofseveral swing state eventshe plans to headline in the final month of the campaign. He’s been brought out as the closer for several Democratic campaigns in Nevada in recent years, including aNovember rallyin 2022 with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) and House Democrats and an October 2018eventwith then-Senate candidate Jacky Rosen. The former president won Nevada by more than 12 percentage points in 2008 — the largest margin this century — and by 7 percentage points in 2012. Democrats won the subsequent two presidential elections in the state, but by narrower margins of 2.5 percentage points. Even eight years after he left office, Obama remainsimmensely popular, rating well above other Democratic presidents, and is apowerful messengerfor Democratic campaigns. Early voting is also a key part of the Harris campaign’s strategy, which aims to turn out as many voters as early as possible in order to spend the key days and weeks before Election Day focusing outreach on people who have not yet voted. Obama was last in Las Vegas in July, when he gave a brief speech at a pre-OlympicsUSA Basketball eventflanked by the men’s team.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/dina-titus-mark-robertson-face-off-again-in-nevadas-1st-congressional-district,True,"It’s a rematch in the race for Nevada’s 1st Congressional District. Two years after Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) defeated Mark Robertson, a retired Army colonel, by more than 5 percentage points, the two are facing off again after Robertson handily won his June primary. But the context of the race is different this time around. National Republicans have essentially ignored the race, spending no money on ads backing Robertson, a far cry from two years ago when GOP groups spent about $9 million on ads, according to ad-tracking firmAdImpact. Titus has also significantly outraised Robertson and, as of the end of June, had amore than $1 million advantagein cash on hand. It’s part of anoverall themewhere national GOP groups largely have steered clear of Southern Nevada’s House races after their spending two years ago amounted to no seat pickups. Notably, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) stumped in Las Vegas this week for John Lee and Drew Johnson — the GOP candidates for Congressional Districts 3 and 4 — but not for Robertson, who is running in the bluest district in the state. It poses an interesting dynamic in the district, which became less Democratic after redistricting three years ago. After previously covering central Las Vegas, the district now stretches from the southeastern part of the city to also include Henderson and Boulder City. The Cook Political Report, an election forecaster,ranks the districtas “Likely Democrat.” Robertson said in an interview that he is more confident in his chances this year, in part because of Republicans being more encouraging of voting early and by mail — legal methods that the GOP largely eschewed two years ago based on the unfounded claims that they lead to widespread fraud. “The message is just ‘vote, vote, vote,’” Robertson said. “I think those things will make a difference.” Meanwhile, Titus is quick to push back the notion that the lack of GOP funding will decide the race. “Elections in Nevada are always very close, so we'll work till the last day,” Titus said. “We don’t take anything for granted.” To be victorious in the 1st Congressional District, the candidate will likely need to appeal to nonpartisans, who represent about 35 percent of the district’s active registered voters, a 4 percentage point increase from two years ago. Democrats and Republicans make up about 32 and 25 percent of registered voters, respectively. Asked how he will appeal to nonpartisan voters, Robertson said he brings a new political perspective because he has never held elected office. “We can't count on the people who created these problems to be the ones to fix it,” Robertson said. “We need somebody who's willing to work across the aisle to find solutions.” Meanwhile, Titus said anyone with doubts about her willingness to work across the aisle should look at her record. In 2023, Titus was ranked as the 94th most bipartisan member of the House (out of 435), according to ananalysisby Lugar Center at Georgetown University. “I say what I mean and I do what I say,” Titus said. “Those are the kind of things people want to hear — that you're there for them. They're not all that interested in whether you're a Democrat or Republican.” Similar to other Republican campaigns this cycle, Robertson is learning into immigration and the economy — issues that voters rank as among the most important — arguing that re-electing Titus would only continue the past few years of increasing inflation and illegal border crossings, though both of those have eased significantly in recent months. Titus’ campaign strategy can best be encapsulated in anadshe released Thursday. The 30-second spot ties Roberston to Project 2025 — a conservative think tank’s policy blueprint for the next Republican administration that has become a weapon in Democrats’ arsenal this year — and accusing him of wanting to ban abortion with no exceptions. However, Robertson hasclarified, dating back to 2022, that he supports abortion exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Additionally, he said in 2022 that he wasthankfulfor the Texas Heartbeat Act, which banned most abortions at the six-week mark, but henow sayshe would not support any federal action that goes against the will of his constituents. Robertson has also pushed back on links to Project 2025, tellingPoliticothat he had never used the words “Project 25.” Titus entered the Nevada political world more than 30 years ago. She won her first race for state Senate in 1988 and served there for 20 years, including 15 as Democratic minority leader. She also ran for Nevada governor in 2006 but lost the general election by 4 percentage points. She entered Congress in 2009 but only lasted one term representing the state’s 3rd Congressional District, losing her first re-election bid by less than 1 percentage point to Republican Joe Heck. Two years later, she ran for the 1st Congressional District, and has been in office ever since. She has served on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for her entire congressional career and has been on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for the past four terms. Titus was also a UNLV government professor for 34 years until 2011, and she is known for her expertise in nuclear power and weaponry. “I've been around a long time,” Titus said. “My integrity has never been challenged.” Robertson, meanwhile, has never held elected office. As a 17-year-old, he joined the Army, where he served for 30 years and retired as a colonel. He said he served in combat zones in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan. He has also owned a financial planning business in Henderson and a real estate investment company and has worked as an adjunct finance professor at UNLV and for a slew of other financial businesses, according toinvestment disclosure forms. Robertson’spersonal financial disclosurelists the value of his assets at between $1.7 million and $6.5 million. The wide range is because of how the personal financial disclosure system works, as candidates report their assets in broad categories, such as one ranging from $1 million to $5 million. He has owned properties in Nevada for decades and previously owned a property in Florida, property records show. He has one residence in Henderson and has at least two properties tied to a family trust. Titus, meanwhile, has assets worth between $1.7 million and $7.1 million, according to herpersonal financial disclosure. Social Security and Medicare Robertson said he wants to work across the aisle on legislation to prevent Social Security and Medicare from going bankrupt, which would result in program cuts as soon as 2035 forSocial Securityand 2036 forMedicare. He wants to create a bipartisan commission where politicians from both parties convene with experts to formulate ways of keeping the programs alive. “My opponent, Dina, has said ‘I will not touch your Social Security,’” Robertson said. “Well, that's a failed strategy. These programs are headed to insolvency. If you do nothing, which is her plan, then they will go bankrupt.” In response, Titus appeared skeptical of expectations of the programs' insolvency, which are made by boards of trustees.. The Medicare insolvency deadline was pushed from 2031 to 2036 this year. “[Republicans] are always talking about the solvency issue because they're wanting to move us down the path towards privatization,” Titus said. “They're calling for a big study. Another name for a study is look for ways to cut.” Instead, Titus said she wants to see program expansion, such as having Medicare cover the cost of glasses. Economy From speaking with voters, Robertson said he thinks inflation is the top issue for Nevadans. To lower inflation (which surged at the beginning of the pandemic but has slowed dramatically), he wants to cut back on government spending, free up America's energy production and roll back government regulations. Asked what more can be done in the next Congress to address inflation, Titus mostly rehashed what has been done in the past four years, such as capping monthly insulin costs to $35 for Medicare recipients and legislation to fund the production of semiconductors in the U.S. She also wants to do more to go after corporations for price gouging, a priority for Vice President Kamala Harris. Whoever wins the race will also vote next year on whether to extendtax cutspassed by Congress and signed by former President Donald Trump that slashed the minimum corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, though it also increased the standard tax deduction that helps middle-class Americans. Titus accused Trump of seeking even greater tax cuts for corporations and crippling the nation’s deficit (estimates showextendingthe cuts could increase the national debt by more than $4 trillion). Robertson did not directly answer whether he would support extending the tax cuts, instead saying he supports tax cuts for middle-class businesses. One point of agreement among Harris and Trump has been ending taxes on tipped wages, a policy that Trump first endorsed at arally in Las Vegasin June. Harrisfollowedsuit two months later. As she has in recent months, Titus said that any legislation to end taxes on tips should be paired with raising the federal minimum wage — currently $7.25 —- to $15. However, Robertson is opposed to the tip tax repeal proposal altogether. “It seems unfair to those hardworking people that don't get tips, that they don't get a tax break,” he said. Immigration One reason Robertson is more confident in his ability to win this year is because of the situation at the southern border, which he said “certainly hasn’t gotten any better in the last two years.” Illegal border crossings reached a record high at the end of 2023, but they havefallen dramaticallythis year, and July saw thefewest monthly encountersat the southern border in nearly four years. In June, President Joe Bidenissued an executive ordermaking it much more difficult for migrants who illegally enter the country to seek asylum and remain in the U.S. That policy came after Senate Republicans blocked a bipartisan immigration bill at thebehest of Trump. It would have increased funding for the Border Patrol and stopped accepting most asylum claims if the number of migrant encounters reached a certain limit. “​If they were serious about immigration reform, they could have worked on that bill and passed it,” Titus said. Robertson, meanwhile, said the bill would not have done enough to address illegal immigration and instead criticized Democrats for not passingH.R. 2, which passed the GOP-led House with no Democratic support last year. The bill would have required all American employers to verify that their employees are lawfully present in the country, added a $50 fee for asylum claims and added a wall to about 900 miles of the southern border, among many other reforms. “Not even allowing it to be discussed or sent to committee is just a raw political move by [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer, and I don't think enough is said about that,” Robertson said. Trump has also pledged to launch the nation’s largest deportation operation ever if he regains the White House. Robertson said he did not have any thoughts on the measure, while Titus was very critical. “How are you going to round up all these people and deport them, and how much is it going to cost? Who's going to do it?” Titus said. “Be reasonable.” Titus and Robertson supported offering a pathway to citizenship for people brought to the U.S. illegally as minors. Housing Titus thinks housing is the number one issue in Southern Nevada. As a start, she said Harris’housing plan— which includes building 3 million homes nationwide and up to $25,000 in assistance for eligible first-time homebuyers — “would make a difference here.” Notably, Harris has not weighed in on the freeing up of federally owned land for affordable housing development in Nevada — a topic ofbipartisan agreementin the Silver State. Titus said that any release of federal land must include some designations specifically for affordable housing, and she supports tax breaks for groups that develop public housing. She also wants to take on property corporations using deceptive tactics to raise leasing costs and sneaking in undisclosed fees, and touted theHousing Vouchers Fairness Act, a bill for which she is the sole co-sponsor, which would allocate $2 billion for rental vouchers in high population areas. Robertson said the housing crisis can be eased by lowering inflation and freeing up federal land for affordable housing development, though he said state and local governments, rather than the federal government, should take the lead on other initiatives to lower housing costs. He also wants to see the six members of Nevada’s congressional delegation come together on a plan for freeing up the land. Ballot questions Nevadans will vote on three prominent ballot questions this year: enshrining abortion rights in the state Constitution, requiring voter ID and implementing ranked-choice voting and open primaries. Titus supports theabortion question, while Robertson called it “unnecessary” given that abortion through 24 weeks is already legal in Nevada (which the question would not change, though it would make it harder for that to go away). Robertson is backing thevoter ID questionas a common-sense measure, but Titus is opposing it because she does not believe voter impersonation and illegal voting are widespread enough issues in Nevada. Titus also is opposing theranked-choice voting and open primariesquestion — saying it would sow confusion — and Robertson said he is still looking into the topic.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/at-vegas-town-hall-harris-faces-questions-from-latinos-on-immigration-health-care,True,"As the presidential race enters its final month, Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for a town hall in Las Vegas on Thursday with undecided Latino voters who lamented a “broken” immigration system and the rising cost of housing, health care and groceries. In a roughly hourlong taped discussion hosted by Univision, set to be broadcast Thursday evening, Harris heard from people including a woman struggling with the recent death of her undocumented mother, another who has faced roadblock after roadblock since she was diagnosed with long COVID and “lost everything,” a man who wants to see a pathway to citizenship for so-called “DREAMers” and a man who appeared skeptical of Harris’ rise to the top of the Democratic ticket this summer. In response, Harris touted her policy proposals and reflected on her middle-class upbringing as she sought to reassure the undecided voters that she would be the best candidate to provide more opportunities for immigrants and bring change to the nation’s health care system. At times, though, Harris spoke in platitudes — rehashing her typical campaign themes of empathy and dignity — without answering the questions directly. She also did not unveil any new policy proposals. The conversation revealed the topics that matter most to undecided Latino voters, a crucial voting bloc in the Silver State that could determine which candidate wins the state’s six electoral votes — and perhaps, the presidency. About 20 percent of Nevada’s registered voters are Latino and about half of them are not members of either major party, according to ananalysisfrom the NALEO Education Fund, a Latino political group. Latinos also have more political power in Nevada than ever before and have grown at a faster rate than Nevada’s overall population,The Indyfound. Recent polling shows that Harris has been struggling to consolidate the overwhelming support she may need among Latinos to win the state. A September poll fromTelevisa/Univisionfound that although Harris is outperforming former President Donald Trump with the constituency (51 percent to 39 percent) she continues to trail behind President Joe Biden’s levels of support in 2020. Campaigns are well aware of the group’s importance. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) participated in a phone banking event with Latino communities on Tuesday, and Trump will hold a roundtable with Latinos on Saturday in Henderson alongside Rosen’s Republican opponent, Sam Brown. Trump also plans to hold a town hall hosted by Univision next week in Miami. And ahead of Thursday’s town hall, theDemocratic National Committeeplastered bilingual billboards and placed print Spanish-language ads throughout Las Vegas. While it’s unclear how all of the75 attendeeswere leaning in the election, Mario Sigbaum, a 70-year-old immigrant from Uruguay, said he was leaning toward Trump. He said he was wary of Biden’s decision to step aside from the race earlier this year and Harris’ quick ascent to secure the nomination. Harris acknowledged that the situation might be “unprecedented,” but she said it did not change the stakes of the race. “This is an unusual time where we as the American people are choosing the rule of law and democracy or admiring dictators and autocracy,” she said. Immigration Ivett Castillo, an operations manager, recalled through tears how her mother died just six weeks ago. Even though her father had obtained citizenship, her mother was never able to, which reduced the amount of care she received. “She was never, ever able to get the type of care and services she deserved,” said Castllo, who asked how Harris would ensure better health systems for these immigrants. In response, Harris referred to abillthe Biden administration introduced on its first day in office that would have expanded pathways to citizenship, but it never got off the ground because of Republican opposition. “Had your mother been able to gain citizenship, she would have been entitled to health care,” Harris said. “This is one example of the fact that there are real people who are suffering because of an inability to put solutions in front of politics.” Harris also referred to the bipartisan immigration bill that GOP senators rejected at thebehest of Trump. The bill, which received somepushbackfrom immigration advocates, proposed that the U.S. would stop accepting most asylum claims if the number of migrant encounters reached a certain limit. Jesus Auspuro recalled how many of his classmates in college were “Dreamers,” which are people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. He asked Harris how she would protect them. “They had to live day by day, and had that fear in them,” Auspuro said. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) was instituted by former President Barack Obama, and the Biden administration has sought to save it amid years of court battles. Itsstatusis currently in flux, and Harris reiterated her support of having a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients. As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harrissupportedusing executive action to give DACA recipients a pathway to citizenship, but she has not reiterated that position of late. “One of the biggest problems with failure to have a comprehensive plan for immigration is that we have not given them the pathway to earn their right to citizenship,” Harris said. Health care Marta, who did not provide her last name, recounted her story of having a heart attack in 2020 and being diagnosed with long COVID shortly after, leaving her unemployed and homeless. Three years ago, she applied for Social Security disability insurance, but she said she still has never heard back. “Because [I’m] low income, I lost everything. I have no health insurance. I can't get medical treatment that I need,” Marta said. “My question for you is, how will you help disabled people so that they can get insurance?” Harris touted the Biden administration’s efforts to have long COVID included as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act and shared her proposal to forgive medical debt for millions of Americans, though specifics of the plan are unclear. Francisco Medina, a Californian who was born in Mexico, works for the Department of Defense and recalled having to wait two years to get an MRI that he needed. “The times that we have to wait … are ridiculous,” Medina said. Harris said she was “sorry it took so long” for Medina to get his care and otherwise championed the Biden administration’s efforts to protect the Affordable Care Act and lower monthly insulin prices to $35 monthly for Medicare recipients. The administration also helped place a $2,000 annual cap on prescription drug costs for seniors, and Harris said she wants to expand that to everyone. “The work that we must do is about understanding health care is a right,” Harris said. “It should not just be a privilege of those who have access to it.” ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/after-canceling-its-nevada-reservations-nrsc-joins-forces-with-brown-in-hybrid-ads,True,"Vastly outspent by Democrats in the U.S. Senate race in Nevada, the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) has scrapped an ambitious spending plan and is now taking a different approach. Last week, the NRSC, the chief fundraising arm of Senate Republicans and a key player in recruitment and strategy in Senate races,removedabout $7.4 million in future independent expenditure advertising from stations in Nevada. On Wednesday, they rebooked some of that money as a hybrid ad with Republican candidate Sam Brown’s campaign, placing a $331,000 buy. While the new NRSC spending is more efficient and therefore the apples-to-apples dollar comparison is less valuable, Democrats still have a resource advantage through the end of the cycle. From Oct. 1 through the end of the year, Democrats booked nearly $27.7 million in ad spending; Republicans currently have about $9.7 million. With hybrid advertising, the NRSC and the Brown campaign must put in equal funds and give equal time to a national issue as they do to the specific race, making for ads that can be clunky. The advantage is that these ads are purchased at the candidate rate — significantly lower than what stations charge outside groups such as the NRSC for independent expenditures. In Nevada, outside groups get charged 10 times more than campaigns, perPolitico. These ads — aboutSocial Security,high costsortaxes on tips— don’t mention Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) or Sam Brown until about halfway through the ad. Public polls have routinely shown Rosen with a lead outside of the margin of error, though strategists in both parties expect the race to be close. With Democrat-held seats in other states appearing more vulnerable — analysts rate the Montana Senate race as “lean Republican” and Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin to be “toss-ups” — some outside groups are choosing to spend there rather than in Nevada. Senate Leadership Fund, the super PACtiedto Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) for example, made a massive late September buy in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. But by going back up on the air — albeit in smaller fashion, though more buys could come in the future weeks — the NRSC is sending a message that national Republicans still believe Nevada is worthy of investment. “We have far more weight on television than we previously did due to our shift in strategy and will continue to support Sam Brown’s campaign to unseat Biden-Harris rubber stamp Jacky Rosen,” said NRSC spokesperson Maggie Abboud. By contrast, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), the Democratic equivalent of the NRSC, portrayed the strategy shift as an acknowledgment of Rosen’s advantage. “Money talks, and Senate Republicans clearly know that Sam Brown has turned out to be a bad candidate whose MAGA agenda and decade-long anti-abortion record is deeply unpopular with Nevada voters,” DSCC communications director David Bergstein said in a statement toThe Nevada Independent. The NRSC conducted joint buys with 2022 candidate Adam Laxalt. They spent about $4.4 million on those ads from Oct. 1 onward. Thus far, the NRSC/Sam Brown joint effort has spent about $337,000 during the same period this year. Campaigns often buy and adjust bookings on a weekly basis as dynamics change. Still, Republicans significantly lag Democrats in overall spending in the Senate race. In September, Rosen and allied outside groups outspent Brown and Republican groups by more than $5.5 million, per data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact. From Oct. 1 through the end of the year in 2022, Democratic spending for Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) totaled $48.4 million while Republicans spent about $39.9 million for Laxalt. Cortez Masto ultimately won by less than 1 percentage point.",Error: Connection error.

It is being republished as part of a partnership betweenThe Nevada IndependentandCarson Now. According to a press release issued from the county clerk’s office, all Carson City voters will be receiving new official mail-in ballots due to an Independent American Party candidate being incorrectly listed as a Democrat. According to the release, ballots will reissued Oct. 16. Clerk-Recorder Scott Hoen, who answered questions by email through Carson City Public Information Officer Cameron Gresh, said that whilenew official mail-in ballots will be sent out,there is no word on when the sample ballots will be arriving. Some people may be under the impression that ballots come from the Secretary of State’s office, but this is not the case. All ballots, sample and official, must come through each County Clerk’s office before they are distributed to voters. According to Hoen, sample ballots are printed by Nevada State Printing after they are sent off by the Clerk-Recorder department. Hoen did not mention what date sample ballots were sent to the printers, which is located in Carson City. Hoen said there was a “period of time” they had to wait for the Secretary of State to confirm whether candidates were on or off the ballot. “Bottom line is that we waited to the last minute to put out the sample ballot to ensure the correct candidates were listed,” Hoen said. The arrival of the mail ballot before the sample ballot was a “timing issue” as mail official ballots were shipped from Washington state through Reno, Hoen said, which allowed the mail ballots to arrive prior to the sample ballots. According to the county clerk's press release, those who have already voted by mail are asked to do so again with the corrected ballot. When asked how an error could have been made, Hoen said that “staff in the Clerk-Recorder’s office work on proofing the ballots."" “Ultimately, a mistake was made, and the Clerk-Recorder takes full responsibility and apologizes for the error,” Hoen said. “It was an error that no one caught before materials were sent to the printer. Additional processes are being set up to correct the situation and prevent errors in the future. In-person voting is not affected by this, and we expect a big turnout with early voting and election day.” We will update with new information as it becomes available. The release is as follows: The Carson City Clerk-Recorder is resending ballots to all Carson City voters following the discovery of an error on ballots mailed to voters. Candidate Lynn Chapman was mistakenly identified as Democrat or “DEM” on the mail ballot, but the correct designation, which appears here, is Independent American Party or IAP”. Every voter will receive a new ballot, listing the correct party affiliation, which will be mailed the week of October 14, 2024. What do I do if I already marked and returned my original mail ballot?- If you have already marked and returned the original mail ballot, please complete the CORRECTED ballot, and return it according to the instructions. What do I do if I have not yet voted my original mail ballot?- If you have not returned the original mail ballot, please wait until you receive a CORRECTED mail ballot to mark your choices and return your CORRECTED ballot according to the instructions. Alternatively, you may appear to vote in-person during the early voting period or on Election Day. October 19, 2024 through November 1, 2024 and Return ballot envelopes have unique IDs assigned to the voter and in-person voters are tracked through Nevada’s Voter Registration Election Management System, ensuring that only one ballot will be counted. All returned original ballots will be held until the corrected ballot is returned or the voter votes in person. If the corrected ballot from a voter who returned the original ballot is not returned and the voter does not vote in person, the Clerk-Recorder’s office will count the original ballot.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-in-nevada-bipartisan-support-for-expanding-pathways-to-legal-citizenship,True,"With former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris proposing to crack down on illegal immigration, a majority of Nevadans support opening more pathways to legal citizenship for undocumented people, according to new polling. The survey, conducted in Spanish and English by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy, found that the majority of Nevadans  prefer creating legal pathways for undocumented immigrants (65 percent) rather than mass deportations (24 percent). Most Nevadans favor strengthening the border (71 percent) and making it harder for immigrants in the country illegally to get employment by requiring employers to use the E-verify system (72 percent). In Nevada, 55 percent of Republicans and 77 percent of Democrats said they supported a proposal outlined in the poll that would create a new type of visa that would allow undocumented immigrants who have been living in the U.S. for years to apply for citizenship, barring that they have not committed a serious crime. They would also pay a penalty and any taxes they owe, while those who didn’t qualify for the visa would be subject to deportation. Currently, no suchpath exists. One in 5 Nevadansare immigrants. Nevada has nearly170,000 undocumented residents, one of the highest per-capita rates in the country. Nevada’s proximity to the southern border makes immigration issues and the reality of a mass deportation campaign more salient than in more northern states, said Steven Kull, a political psychologist at the University of Maryland and director of the Program for Public Consultation. “There are more people living here who have been here for a while, who may not be documented,” said Kull. “It's not just a vague concept. They know a lot of people, and all those people would be gone, and that could be disruptive.” The University of Maryland poll is one of many issue-focused polls the group is conducting in swing states ahead of the 2024 general election. Across all six swing states surveyed (except Pennsylvania), Republicans and Democrats favored expanding legal pathways for immigrants, while also increasing the number of Border Patrol agents. In Nevada, 599 adults were polled in online opt-in surveys from Sept. 23 to Oct. 1. The survey had a margin of error of 4.6 percent. In open-ended answers, many respondents expressed the belief that creating more legal pathways would minimize exploitation of workers and improve economic competitiveness. “I’m from Puerto Rico, so I’m an American citizen, and my family came to the U.S. in search of a better life,” wrote one respondent. “The only difference between me and a person from Mexico or Honduras is the piece of dirt I was born on. If someone has been in the U.S. for years, worked honestly, paid taxes, and has become part of their community, they deserve clemency.” At the same time, a majority of Nevadans said that although they’d like to increase the availability of work visas, they believe it should be more difficult for undocumented immigrants to get employment. In Nevada, 74 percent of Republicans and 71 percent of Democrats surveyed said they are in favor of a proposal to require employers to check all new hires through E-Verify, a web-based system that confirms the eligibility of employees to work in the United States. A majority (69 percent) also said they supported a proposal to create work visas for immigrants to fill roles that haven’t been taken by American workers. Earlier this year, the Senaterejecteda proposal to hire thousands more federal immigration and border personnel, but the PPC poll found that a majority of Nevadans across both parties support upping the number of Border Patrol agents from about 20,000 to 22,000. A plan to improve and expand walls along the southern border, estimated to cost about $25 billion, was favored by 79 percent of Nevada’s Republicans, but only 49 percent of the state’s Democrats. Vice President KamalaHarrishas said that she would hire thousands more agents if elected as president. When informed about the record-breaking backlog of asylum cases, 67 percent of Nevadans said they’d favor hiring several hundred more immigration judges to help deal with the issue. Nevada was one of only three states surveyed where a majority of Republicans (59 percent) also supported the measure. “There's an overarching theme that goes through the whole survey, that Americans want the process to be more legal, ” Kull said. “For the 11 million or so people who've been here for a while, the desire is to integrate them into the legal system.” ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-nevadas-only-gop-house-district-incumbent-amodei-faces-well-heeled-indie-challenge,True,"Editor’s note: Sunlight Research Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, contributed research and data analysis for this report. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) has represented Northern Nevada’s deeply conservative 2nd Congressional District since 2011, securing victory in seven election cycles. But this cycle is different. For the first time since 1998, no Democrat is running for the geographically massive district, which includes Carson City, Churchill, Douglas, Elko, Eureka, Humboldt, Lander, Pershing, Storey, Washoe and White Pine counties, as well as parts of Lincoln and Lyon counties. Instead, Amodei’s main challenger is Greg Kidd, a wealthy venture capitalist and registered Republican who successfully submitted 1,500 signatures to run for the seat as a nonpartisan. Kidd is largely self-funding his campaign, which he says ensures he’s not beholden to other interests and can focus on campaigning rather than finding donors. Amodei has never faced a serious challenge, handily defeating the closest contender in each general election he's run in by double-digit percentage points. The narrowest margin between Amodei and an opponent in a general election was 2020, when Amodei defeated Democrat Patricia Ackerman by only 15.8 percentage points. In his most recent re-election bid in 2022, Amodei won with nearly 60 percent of the vote and a margin of 21.9 percentage points. As of Wednesday, campaign ad data from AdImpact indicates Amodei has spent or reserved about $110,000 in general election ads so far — the first ad reservations he’s made in a general election since at least 2018. He is still lagging significantly behind Kidd, who has been on the airwaves since June, spending more than $3 million in ads. Kidd’s campaign has acknowledged that running without the support of a major party can be an uphill battle, in part because voters often select candidates along party lines. A party apparatus typically also offers additional get-out-the-vote support and candidates can focus their efforts on voters in just one party, but he hopes to leverage a growing share of nonpartisan voters. Nearly 38 percent of the active registered voters in the 2nd Congressional District are Republicans, with almost 25 percent of voters registered as Democrats and nearly 37 percent of voters registered as nonpartisan or with a minor party. As part of his campaign, Kidd said he’s been on listening tours across the state and meeting with voters across the political spectrum. He said his main reason for wanting to oust Amodei is to establish better constituent services, bring new ideas to the district and represent residents from across the political spectrum. “There’s not strong Amodei support,” Kidd said. “This is a situation where having flexibility could really make a difference for Nevada.” Amodei, whose family tree in Nevada dates back to the 1800s, lives in Carson City and has been spotted outside mowing his lawn or shopping at the local grocery store. He has two adult daughters and ran for Congress in a special election in 2011 after serving 12 years in the state Senate and two years in the Assembly. An attorney by trade, Amodei served with the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps from 1983 to 1987 and was the president of the Nevada Mining Association from 2007 to 2008. Born in Carson City, the only time he left the area was while on active duty and attending law school at the University of the Pacific’s McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento. Amodei chaired the Republican Party until May 2011 and was former President Donald Trump’s Nevada campaign chair in 2016. He did not lead Trump’s re-election campaign in the Silver State in 2020 after being thefirst House Republican to support an impeachment inquiryinto the then-president. Amodei latervoted against impeaching Trump. As of June, Amodeihas raised$815,000, and has about $530,000 in cash on hand during the 2024 campaign cycle. His top donors this cycle include the Sierra Nevada Corporation ($14,300), a federal aerospace and defense contractor, and South Point Hotel & Casino ($13,200), which is outside the district. Amodei said he is always willing to listen to constituents, explain his position and weigh the pros and cons of proposed legislation before voting on it. Every election has included challengers, Amodei said, noting that there have been “no free passes” and Kidd’s campaign is part of the democratic process. But, he said, “I'm not turning over that responsibility to someone who I don't think has lived it and earned it without a hell of a fight.” Born and raised in Connecticut, Kidd moved to Crystal Bay about four years ago for the outdoor recreation opportunities, and believes he could make a significant difference in Nevada. He has two teenage daughters and holds a bachelor’s degree from Brown University, a master’s in business from Yale and a public policy degree from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Kidd, who splits his time between Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas and snowboards, mountain bikes and climbs depending on the season, describes himself as socially liberal and fiscally conservative. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) hasendorsed himand the Nevada State Democratic Party’s executive board has recommended him as a candidate — the strongest level of support possible for a non-Democratic candidate. But the party apparatus has not donated money to his candidacy. Despite party differences, Nevada State Democratic Party Chair Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-NV) said in a statement toThe Nevada Independentthat Kidd shares values with the party such as protecting a woman’s right to choose and making housing more affordable. Kidd has focused an aggressive campaign advertising blitz on the message of “free, fair and wild,” a slogan modeled in part after New Hampshire’s “live free or die” motto. He’s also highlighted in campaign ads and stump speeches that he will support the right to an abortion, try to impose term limits and serve as a vote to break Congress’ gridlock. “I can work with Democrats, I can work with Republicans,” Kidd said in a recent appearance at a Washoe Democrats meeting. “I may not be the ‘D’ you wanted, but I hope I’m giving you the reason why I’m in a position to work on the issues that are important to Nevadans, important to most ‘Ds’.” Kidd told those assembled at the Washoe Democrats meeting that victory could stem from winning the Democratic vote in a high-turnout election, gaining a plurality of the nonpartisan vote and peeling off a few Republican voters. As the “new guy on the block,” though, he views the campaign as an investment. Even if he doesn’t win, he said, the effect of the conversations and ideas he’s been able to push on the campaign trail will likely have long-term implications. “Do we need new legislation for banking? What should we do to clean up the blight? Just to get all those issues out there,” Kidd said. “I don't have anything against Mark, but he has not been exactly the highest energy person in Congress.” ON THE POLICIES Finances and the tech industry Kidd’s net worth is estimated to be between $390 million and well over $1.1 billion, according to personal financial disclosures. As the co-founder and CEO of Hard Yaka, a venture capital firm, Kidd is also an angel investor and helped Jack Dorsey while Dorsey was establishing the social media company Twitter (now X) and the payment processing app Square. Kidd characterized his role with Dorsey in modest terms, describing himself as the “guy that put milk in the fridge.” He said he ultimately views himself as a team builder and facilitator, encouraging innovation. He has also worked at the Federal Reserve, which he said informs how he thinks about regulations. Kidd said it’s vital to have regulations that promote competition and innovation but he doesn’t believe in regulation by enforcement through the court system. Kidd filed his personal financial disclosure in September, two months after the deadline, but he said the level of detail he went into required additional time, and he received an extension that he requested. That form indicates he’s made loans to at least three individuals, ranging from an estimated $15,000 to $1 million in value, which he said are to help purchase homes. “People are much more competitive when they can make a cash purchase,” Kidd said. Working across the aisle Amodei said he works across the aisle, referencing relationships he has with Rep. John Garamendi (D-CA), Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) and Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA). “We don't vote the same way on a lot of stuff. But we work together on a lot of stuff,” Amodei said. “We’re working on things that are taking care of first responders, environmental stuff.”Amodei said he likes to focus on policy and get away from the talking points about being a strong Democrat or Republican. He said many Democrats in Nevada are liberal on social issues, but on other issues, they tend to be more moderate, and “people feel more comfortable with” the way he works. Kidd inherently sees his nonpartisan status as a boon to working across the aisle. But even independents tend to choose a side when they take office — independent senators Bernie Sanders and Kyrsten Sinema caucus with Democrats, for example. Pressed on who he would caucus with, Kidd did not commit to a party and said he would join colleagues on issues that he supported, such as caucusing with Democrats on women’s rights. “I’m not doing a traditional Democratic or Republican caucus, but something like the Problem Solvers [Caucus],” he said. “That's really what this is about. Just kind of like Mark Twain, this kind of concept of American pragmatism, we come in and we check our Rs and Ds at the door.” Economy Kidd said his top priority would be enshrining abortion protections at the federal level. But beyond that, Kidd said he would focus on Nevada's future, which would mean increasing the state’s assets and focusing on economic development, including infrastructure. “The top issue for me is that Nevada has to go from a hand-to-mouth state with no strategic planning to being very strategic about its future,” Kidd said. He said that could mean committing Nevada and the U.S. to energy independence and resilience in the future and closing the lithium loop, or keeping the processing, manufacturing and recycling of existing lithium batteries into new batteries within the state. He added that Nevada should be the wealthiest, most prosperous state in the country and it's important to develop legislation that brings more federal dollars to the state and create a simplified regulatory environment. For Amodei, the economy is one of the top issues, and legislation needs to focus on the massive energy costs in the Silver State, including the costs of fuel and heating oil. “Energy’s in everything. What’s it cost to heat? What’s its cost to cool? What’s it cost for economic development?” Amodei said. He criticized the Biden administration for mainly focusing on electric vehicles and said there are challenges with transitioning to them, such as safety risks to firefighters when lithium-ion batteries catch fire. Some of the drivers of energy costs are federal permitting, Amodei said, noting that whether someone wants to grow alfalfa, mine for lithium or use other natural resources, they need to get a permit. Due process and transparency are important, he said, adding, as is the National Environmental Policy Act, but waiting five years or longer for approval is a problem. Abortion Amodei said he believes in individual states' abilities to make their own choices around abortion law. “I wouldn't vote for anything that overturns what Nevada voters did in 1990,” Amodei said, referring to the referendum that protected abortion rights in state law. In Nevada, Amodei said state law already protects abortion rights through 24 weeks of pregnancy, and he respects what voters enacted. However, he said he would not be voting for Ballot Question 6, which would solidify those protections by putting them in the Nevada Constitution, arguing that state law already protects abortion rights and the ballot measure doesn’t have clear language. For example, Amodei said the ballot measure changes the 24-week limit to “fetal viability” and would allowqualified medical professionals— not just physicians, as in current law — to offer abortion services. Kidd, whose ex-wife is an OB-GYN doctor, said whether it's in vitro fertilization, contraception or abortion, he dislikes that a border could change the level of health care someone can access. He said he would support implementing abortion protections at the federal level and doesn’t believe there should be a situation where a state can strip away someone’s rights. He said he would support Question 6, noting, “given that we have the Supreme Court … the best you can do is enshrine it at the state level until the planets align at the federal level.” Tax policy Kidd said he believes billionaires should be taxed at higher rates and that the tax code should be simpler, allowing individuals to file their taxes more easily. “I got off very well under the Trump administration,” Kidd said. “I could pay higher.” Amodei said he would support keeping the Trump tax cuts in place. “If you're doing something that creates value, and the local, state or federal government is getting its money through different ways which encourage growth, economic activity, all that sort of stuff, great,” he said. Both candidates said they are open to expanding child tax credits and ending taxes on tips. Amodei said he’d be open to not taxing overtime pay or Social Security benefits. Immigration Amodei has criticized President Joe Biden’s handling of immigration, especially regarding reports of undocumented immigrants beingreleased within the U.S. In past interviews, he’s explained that it is “Congress’ job,” which has not been the case, he said, because immigration has become “uber-politicized.” On the federal level, Amodei backed“compromise” immigration legislation in 2018that would have legalized undocumented young people known as DREAMers and given them a path to citizenship. But he has disagreed with portions of former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and supports“merit-based” immigration, such as theFarm Workforce Modernization Act. Amodei was among 30 House Republicans to join Democrats in support of the act, which gave legal status to undocumented agricultural workers. In 2021, Amodei voted against a bill thatwould have provided a pathway to citizenshipfor DREAMers. Kidd said there’s no reason for immigration to be a “political football.” His website lists support for comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform and permanent protection for DREAMers and those who received temporary protected status. He said reform could look like the right levels of legal immigration and guest workers in key sectors and stiff controls against illegal entry and exploitative situations. “Just figure out what the country needs and wants to do as part of a democratized negotiation that has the stakeholders in the room,” he said. “It hasn’t been since (former President Ronald) Reagan, since we had any actual meaningful, not just immigration, but visa reform.” Yucca Mountain Asked about a proposal to make Yucca Mountain a nuclear waste facility, Kidd said the proposal is “dead,” but there is an issue about where to store nuclear waste. If a Yucca Mountain was pitched that was sound, he said, “I’d negotiate like hell for what we get in exchange for doing it.” Amodei has staunchly opposed storing nuclear waste about 90 miles outside of Las Vegas at Yucca Mountain, an idea revived by the Trump administration and Congress. Housing Amodei said he believes in the importance of affordable housing, and the government could work to ease the permitting process or find ways to reduce burdens on developers, alongside releasing federal land for housing development. “The good news is that Nevada is surrounded by federal land, but the bad news is that it’s not easy to get a federal land bill through Congress,” he said. Critics have said the development of more land also requires potentially costly infrastructure and could strain or hinder public services in the case of wildfires or other natural disasters. Kidd said addressing the housing crisis can involve releasing new federal land, but pointed out that there is lots of vacant land available now. He said he is neutral on building up or building out but supports public-private partnerships to promote mixed-use development, and multiunit housing is needed, too. He also said there are opportunities for low-cost guaranteed financing that could help developers feel more secure about building housing even if the real estate market experiences a boom-bust cycle. Election policy Amodei said he would vote against a measure to implement open primaries and ranked-choice voting (Question 3). “[T]his initiative has the potential to open the ballot to negative influence from opposing political parties meddling in each other's electoral process,” Amodei said in astatement about the ballot measurewhen it was coming before voters for the first time in 2022. But he supports a voter ID initiative (Question 7). Kidd said he will be voting in favor of the open primaries and ranked-choice voting ballot measure but would not support a voter ID initiative, which he worries could disenfranchise voters.This story was updated on 10/14/2024 at 12:36 p.m. to clarify that the Nevada State Democratic Party has recommended Kidd but not formally endorsed him.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-raises-12-1-million-in-third-quarter-of-senate-race-her-best-haul-yet,True,"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) reported raising $12.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, her best fundraising quarter of the cycle and approaching record levels seen in the 2022 Nevada Senate race. In the third quarter of 2022, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) set a fundraising record of $15 million. Although Cortez Masto was thought to be the most vulnerable Democrat in the Senate last cycle, Rosen is one of seven tough seats that Democrats are defending — and analystsrateher re-election odds as safer than her counterparts in Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Wisconsin. That could explain Rosen’s smaller haul. While her Republican opponent Sam Brown has not yet released his fundraising total, Rosen has outraised him in every quarter thus far — last quarter, shefinished$3.6 million ahead of him, breaking Nevada fundraising records by bringing in $7.6 million in the second quarter. Rosen entered October with $4.8 million in cash on hand. Her campaign has spent nearly $64 million through Tuesday, per political ad tracking firm AdImpact, and has over $5.6 million in reservations booked through the end of the year. She has used that financial advantage to bombard the airwaves with ads on a variety of topics, from abortion to cost of living to bipartisanship. Campaign manager Stewart Boss said in a statement that the campaign would use its financial advantage to “continue … talking to swing voters across Nevada about the high stakes in this election” and defining Rosen as a bipartisan problem solver while tying Brown to right-wing extremism. Rosen’s campaign said more than 81,000 donors this quarter were first-time contributors, and that the average donation size was $37. Full details about donations to each candidate will be available by the Federal Election Commission’s Oct. 15 reporting deadline — the last campaign finance reporting requirement before the Nov. 5 election.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-reno-walz-touts-home-health-care-plan-harris-receives-first-nevada-tribe-endorsement,True,"Less than a month before the November election, Democratic vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) made the Harris campaign’s latest bid to turn out voters in the Silver State, highlighting a recently announced proposal to cover home care, vision and hearing under Medicare and receiving Nevada’s first tribal endorsement of the cycle. In a nearly half-hour speech to an audience of about 2,000 people, Walz discussed housing, the economy and health care, touting the campaign’s plans for $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, Medicare’s negotiation of prescription drug prices under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and Vice President Kamala Harris’ Medicare announcement to help individuals caring for children and aging parents. “For the first time in history, [Harris] negotiated with Big Pharma to make sure that we can now negotiate for Medicare drugs. The savings we make from that can pay for our senior care,” Walz said, highlighting how funding for Harris’ Medicare proposal will come from the drug-price negotiation plan and crackdowns on hidden drug costs. Walz also criticized former President Donald Trump’s campaign’s focus on federal land being the solution to the housing crisis, saying that doesn’t apply to states such as Minnesota, where federal land is limited. He instead touted the proposed down payment assistance and attacked the corporate purchase of homes. While federal land in Minnesota accounts for about7 percent of its total land area, in Nevada, the federal governmentowns about 86 percentof the land, limiting its development and use. The opening up of such lands in the Silver State has received bipartisan support from the state’s Republican governor, Joe Lombardo, and Democratic members of Congress, though conservationistshave arguedthat any lands bill should sufficiently protect the environment, and some critics of releasing federal lands for development have called for less urban sprawl and more upward development. Critics have said the development of more land also requires potentially costly infrastructure and could strain or hinder public services in the case of wildfires or other natural disasters. “The housing issue is real,” Walz said. “It’s generational wealth, but it's much more than that … It's the place you gather for holidays. It's the place you bring your kids home from the hospital.” On foreign affairs, Walz tore into Trump for recent revelations that the former president hadas many as seven secret calls with Russian President Vladimir Putinsince he left the White House in 2021 and gave COVID-19 testing equipment to Putin while he was president. “I can guarantee we do not have dictators on speed dial,” Walz said. “Donald Trump is a risk to our national security.” The Harris campaign event in Reno at the Grand Sierra Resort came a month after the campaign postponed a rally because of awildfire in the region. Walz discussed the fire in his opening remarks, calling for a “grateful round of applause for our first responders.” Ahead of Walz’s remarks at the rally, Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe Chairman Steven Wadsworth announced his tribe's endorsement of Harris, saying the tribe is backing candidates who will protect its sacred society and vital funding. The tribe has approximately 3,000 members. “[Harris and Walz] see us as valuable voices in this presidential election,” Wadsworth said. “Meanwhile, the opposing party calls us names, uses harmful rhetoric to degrade us.” Wadsworth noted therecord investmentsmade by the Biden-Harris administration in Native American communities across the country and the record number of Native Americans appointed to government offices, including the first Native American cabinet member, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and a 35th generation New Mexican. He said he hopes other tribes follow suit. Walz landed at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport on Tuesday evening ahead of the rally and met with leaders from the Yerington Paiute Tribe, Fallon Paiute Shoshone Tribe, Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe and the Stewart Community of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California. Native American voters are among the critical demographics for presidential candidates hoping to win the Silver State, withpollingindicating Native American voters generally support Democratic candidates versus Republicans. Estimates based on U.S. Census data place members ofNevada’s 28 Indigenous nations, bands and coloniesof voting-age population at about 70,000 people, more than the 33,596vote marginbetween President Joe Biden and Trump in Nevada’s 2020 election.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/among-some-bernie-sanders-supporters-in-nevada-harris-is-the-best-of-the-choices,True,"Alex Henkell-Malespin understands progressive wariness toward Vice President Kamala Harris. The 24-year-old often sees his friends calling out President Joe Biden’s — and, by extension, Harris’ — continued support of Israel amid months of continued violence and civilian casualties in Gaza. The issue is also personal to him, as he is set to join the Marine Corps later this month, and the possibility of a regional war in the Middle East concerns him. But he also thinks the stakes are too high to sit out this election. He views Harris as a far superior candidate to former President Donald Trump — specifically because of her gun control views (he was at UNLV duringthe school shootinglast year) and her general rhetoric — and is hopeful Harris would ramp up her pressure on Israel if she becomes president. “She is the best of the choices,” Henkell-Malespin said. Winning over progressive voters in Nevada could be key for Harris to prevail in the Silver State — and ultimately, the presidency — but she is facing a voting bloc that has expressed fierce opposition to the Biden administration’s actions since Hamas’ attack on Israel one year ago Monday killed more than 1,200 people. The administration has called for a ceasefire and maintained that Israel has a right to defend itself. But opponents on the left say it is not doing enough to limit civilian casualties in Gaza and should stop weapons shipments to Israel. To help sell Harris, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) stumped for her in Nevada last week, holding a quasi-rally and town hall in East Las Vegas on Thursday and canvassing in North Las Vegas on Friday. Sanders is popular in the Silver State — he won the state’s Democratic presidential caucus in 2020 and his populist economic positions have appealed in a union-heavy state where voters, like the rest of the country, prioritize the economy above all else. For about an hour in East Las Vegas, Sanders spoke to around 300 people and took questions from attendees. Much of his speech focused on wealth and health care inequities. He only addressed the Middle East once, at the end of his remarks — Sanders has been among the strongest critics in Congress of the administration’s Israel policy and last month sponsored aresolutionto block the sale of more than $20 billion worth of weapons to Israel. It’s unknown how much the escalating conflict in the Middle East will hurt Harris in Nevada. A Bloomberg/Morning Consultpollconducted last month found about two-thirds of likely voters in Nevada considered the Israel-Hamas war as important in determining their vote, though that was the second-lowest rate among 20 issues posed to respondents. Nevadans were also less likely than voters in swing states overall to call the issue important to their decisions. To get a better sense of Nevada progressives’ thoughts on Harris,The Nevada Independentspoke with 10 attendees at Sanders’ events. Many of them are longtime Sanders supporters and were steadfast in supporting Harris, mostly because of who is running against her. They acknowledged that they did not completely agree with the Biden administration's Israel policy, but did not have many other policy critiques of Harris, who hasmoderateda slew of her policy positions this year. In an interview withThe Nevada Independent,Sanders said he has found it easy to convince progressives to vote for Harris, and that the choice is “crystal clear,” even if they disagree with some of her policies. “I think progressives understand that we need to have a president who believes in democracy,” Sanders said. “Donald Trump does not.” Sterling Raiklen, 24, has supported Sanders since his ascendant presidential run in 2016. He said that he resonates “greatly with the people in Gaza,” and that Harris’ rhetoric surrounding the conflict — calling for more humanitarian aid and a two-state solution — aligns with his views. “We need to find a way to fix the humanitarian crisis, but the way we do that — we definitely don't want to elect Donald Trump,” Raiklen said. “Trump has signaled that he's going to ‘wipe out Hamas,’ which I don't think means wipe out Hamas. I think that that means being more encouraging of [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s more extremist policies.” However, Raiklen also acknowledged that the issue is of less importance in Nevada than other battleground states. As the deputy state director for the Nevada chapter ofProgressive Victoryhe talks to Nevadans while knocking doors and visiting college campuses. The Middle East rarely comes up, and said he instead is more concerned about general disengagement. “Whether they're Republican or Democrat or independent, they are not a fan of the same old, same old,” Raiklen said. “They're feeling it in their grocery store bill, they're seeing it with their educational opportunities, with health care problems that they're recognizing.” For Robin Smith, it's clear that Harris’ support of Israel is a politically necessary move in an already contentious election (pro-Israel groups have poured millions into the election). As a military veteran, the 58-year-old says that she believes that Israel is violating international lawby bombing hospitalsand attackingcivilians, but she doesn’t begrudge Harris because of her support of Israel. “Because she's trying to be elected, she can't take a stance one way or the other,” Smith said. Smith, who voted for Sanders in 2016, said that she plans to vote for Harris this cycle. Trump’sdisparaging commentsabout military veterans, such as reportedly callingdeceased soldiers “losers,”is one of the primary reasons she supports the vice president. Kevin Abrahami, 27, considers himself “very left-wing” on economic issues and supports Harris’ pledges to advance the middle class and take on corporations. Although he disagrees with the Biden administration’s policy on Israel, it’s not enough for him to not vote. “You vote for 80 percent [of a candidate’s policies],” Abrahami said. “You’re not going to get everything from the candidate.” Sanders emphasized the way to effect change is by voting. “These things don’t happen by accident. They happen by legislation,” Sanders said. “You can’t moan and groan and [say], ‘I’m not going to vote.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-assembly-district-25-candidates-selena-la-rue-hatch-and-diana-sande,True,"As Democrats attempt to hold their supermajority in the Assembly, Northern Nevada’s Assembly District 25 is one of the districts where Republicans hope to gain a foothold. The sprawling swing district stretching from Bartley Ranch to Reno’s Northgate community includes parts of the city’s old southwest and northwest neighborhoods and Caughlin Ranch communities.Assemblywoman Selena La Rue Hatch (D-Reno)represents the district where registered Democratic (33 percent) and Republican (30 percent) voters are fairly evenly split, with nonpartisans making up about 28 percent of voters. La Rue Hatch is a fourth-generation Nevadan who grew up on a ranch near Pyramid Lake and teaches world history and geography at North Valleys High School. She attended Boston University for her undergraduate degree and later returned to Reno, where she earned a teaching degree at UNR and wanted “to give back to the community.” La Rue Hatch is seeking re-election to a district she won with almost 54 percent of the just over 32,000 votes cast in the 2022 election. She said her goal as an elected official is to bring the voices of her students, their families and her community into the halls of power and improve education in the Sagebrush State. Her Republican challenger, Diana Sande, was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, and moved to Nevada about 21 years ago. She works in Reno as the program manager of the Black Youth Mental Health Initiative, a statewide program that addresses mental health for Black youth through a policy lens. Sande said she knew she wanted to run for office when she was 17 after she had a gun put to her head in a Latin American country that had been under a dictatorship for a long time and never wanted to feel powerless like that again. She said she’s running to ensure that there is no one-party rule in the Legislature, protect Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s ability to veto legislation and represent her community from a moderate perspective. If elected, Sande would be Northern Nevada’s only Latina legislator. La Rue Hatch said one of the most important tasks of a legislator is to represent their community, regardless of party politics. She said she is proud of her voting record, which marks her as an independent legislator who is among the top five Democrats tobreak with their party, and her bipartisan work, including a bill she co-sponsored and co-presented with Assemblywoman Jill Dickman (R-Sparks)banningthe placement of GPS tracking devices on people’s cars. The bill came in response to atracking deviceplaced by a private investigator on Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve’s car and private investigations into two other Northern Nevada politicians asharassmentof political figures in the region has increased. During the campaign, La Rue Hatch has faced attacks this election cycle from the Lombardo-affiliated Better Nevada PAC, whichlaunched a websiteaccusing her of “spending big on offices for herself” and “hiking gas taxes.” The misleading claims surround a capital improvement budget that the Legislature is constitutionally required to pass (the legislation resulted in offices being built in Southern Nevada) and a bill that would have authorized, but not outright, increased gas prices. Sande has faced questions about her ties to lobbyists in the Legislature. Her father-in-law is a retired lobbyist, and her brother-in-law, John Sande IV, is a lobbyist with Argentum Partners. When asked whether the two would influence her decision-making as a legislator, Sande said they would not. “I’m my own person,” she said. Below, we explore La Rue Hatch and Sande’s views on a variety of key legislative issues.Click herefor the full list of questions we asked each candidate and their edited responses. Education School choice Reproductive rights Elections Health care Housing Firearm policies Tax credits Education La Rue Hatch said one of the key areas that need attention is class sizes. “We have the largest class sizes in the nation,” she said. “If I could enact one policy, it would be to put those hard caps on our class sizes and ensure that our kids are getting the individual attention and instruction that they need.” Sande, who has two children “on the spectrum,” referring to autism, said she would want to increase the support for special needs students. “I know that they're completely overloaded in their caseload,” she said. “I also know that there are many kids that are going undiagnosed and not getting the resources that they need.” La Rue Hatch said it’s vital to invest in schools, and the state should bring Nevada’s per-pupil funding in line with the national average. Sande didn’t give a yes or no answer to increasing school funding but said she’d like to see outcomes correlated with increased funding and a focus on reading at an early age. The two candidates aligned with their respective parties on the issue of universal school meals for students. La Rue Hatch said she supported universal free meal programs in school, citing statistics that 1 in 5 students in Nevada is experiencing hunger. She said she’s had students from abusive or neglectful homes whose parents would not fill out the proper paperwork, leaving their child without a meal option. Sande said the government already covers meals for students who are in need, and the money that could theoretically go toward a universal school meal program should be spent on other needs, such as youth mental health. School choice La Rue Hatch said the phrase “school choice” to exclusively refer to education voucher programs is a misnomer. There’s choice within the public school system, she said, pointing to magnet schools and dual language programs where students learn academic content in two languages. “I draw a line when we talk about taking public dollars and giving them to unaccountable private schools,” La Rue Hatch said. “They are allowed to pick and choose who they can accept. They are not required to teach standards in the same way.” La Rue Hatch said she would not have supported the state’s creation of the Opportunity Scholarship program. However, she does not believe in punishing students and would support allowing students and their siblings currently in the program to continue to use it. Sande said she supports Opportunity Scholarships, arguing that parents should feel empowered to decide what is best for their children. Reproductive rights La Rue Hatch said she will support in vitro fertilization (IVF) protections, vote for Question 6, the ballot measure seeking to enshrine existing abortion protections into the Nevada Constitution, and would support a broader abortion rights initiative going through the Legislature that would protect a more expansive range of reproductive health services, including fertility treatments and access to birth control. “As we saw with Roe v. Wade falling, nothing is guaranteed,” La Rue Hatch said, responding to the argument that expanding the law is unnecessary because Nevada already protects abortions up to 24 weeks. Sande said she would support legislation protecting IVF and supports the right to an abortion. “At the end of the day, anything about decisions that we make, about our health, man or woman, it should be in the hands of that person,” she said. “End of story.” But she said she would not be voting for Question 6 because state law already protects abortion rights and the ballot measure doesn’t have clear language. For example, Sande said the ballot measure changes the 24-week limit to “fetal viability” and would allowqualified medical professionalsto offer abortion services. While the proposed constitutional amendment does not directly define “qualified health care practitioner,” the term typically refers to a broader subset of health care providers that includes registered nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners or midwives, as well as physicians. Under current Nevada law, only a physician can offer abortion services. Sande did not give a direct yes or no answer to a question about whether she would support the broader constitutional amendment that is going before the Legislature in 2025.  She said she would ""definitely be open to the conversation to continue to protect reproductive freedom."" Elections La Rue Hatch said she believes in Nevada’s election system as it stands and would not support the voter ID initiative, which she described as a “solution in search of a problem.” It feeds the narrative that somehow Nevada’s election system is not secure, and that there’s rampant fraud despite evidence to the contrary, she said. “I am very concerned about the voter ID initiative,” La Rue Hatch said. “I think it's going to create a barrier for many disenfranchised communities to participate fully in our elections, without doing anything to make our elections more safe or more secure.” Sande said she grew up as an American outside of the country, and those countries require identification to vote. “I support it. I think it also streamlines the process as well,” said Sande, who added that she needed more time to consider arguments that voter ID laws could disenfranchise older voters or other communities who may struggle to get an identification card. As for changes to the state’s campaign finance system, La Rue Hatch said she wants to more scrutiny over C4 groups or nonprofits that can advocate for causes or candidates, such as the governor’s inaugural committee, which are not required to disclose their donors but engage in political work and political attacks. “The governor’s group is doing political attacks on me on behalf of my opponent, and voters in my district have no idea who is paying for all these attacks and for all these ads,” La Rue Hatch said. “And I know it’s not just me. It is across the state.” Sande said she stood by the results of the 2020 election and indicated that she supports efforts to strengthen Nevada's campaign finance disclosure requirements. Health care La Rue Hatch said reducing the cost of prescription drugs and addressing the state’sprovider shortageare high priorities. As costs have gone up, she said she’s heard from constituents who are struggling to make ends meet. In 2023, La Rue Hatch said she supported a bill that would have applied the Medicare-negotiated costs of 10 drugs under the Inflation Reduction Actto all Nevada residents. Lombardo later vetoed the bill, but La Rue Hatch said she would support the policy a second time. “I think that that is really critical for helping reduce prescription drug costs because I think that a huge number of Nevadans are going without,” she said. “They're skipping doses, they're trying to stretch it. They are choosing between rent or medicine.” Sande said she had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, and it took the emergency room three times to figure out what the issue was and if she didn’t have an understanding of the medical system or have insurance, she would be dead. She said people who are underinsured, and those with language barriers, have a very difficult time navigating the medical system and that emergency rooms have become the place for primary care and mental health crises or even addressing addiction. Sande said she’d like to find a way to incentivize large companies to offer in-house primary care. This would help Nevadans and lessen the load on the state’s beleaguered health care system, she said. Housing Both candidates agree that the state’s housing crisis will require a multifaceted approach and that there is no single magic solution. La Rue Hatch said lawmakers need to examine zoning to allow communities to use existing land to build up instead of out, reevaluate the state’s incentive system to ensure affordable housing is being built and stop corporations from buying up neighborhoods and outbidding local residents. She added that legislators should examine tenant protections, including the state’s unique, rapid summary eviction process. Nevada is one of the only states in the county where the tenant is required to file first in court as opposed to the landlord under the summary eviction law, La Rue Hatch said. She said that the process is confusing for tenants and it’s vital to “clarify that process so that it is fair and understandable for everybody involved.” She voted for a bill later vetoed by Lombardo that would have changed the order of filing. Sande said she agrees with Lombardo’s approach of allocating more federal land to housing but that protecting the state’s wide open spaces is also vital and other solutions are needed. “We want to still protect the culture of what Nevada is,” Sande said. “We need to figure out how we continue to look at conversations around economic development and addressing the housing issues without affecting the culture.” While door-knocking, Sande said she’s heard complaints that areas in Reno and Sparks are not being fully developed, and there’s an opportunity to come up with solutions in that realm as well. She added that she doesn’t like the government interfering in business but would support reforms to Nevada’s summary eviction process, noting that it’s important to “strike a balance between protecting landlords and ensuring tenants have enough time and resources to respond.” La Rue Hatch said she “seriously disagree[s]” with Lombardo on allocating more federal land. She added that she believes Lombardo is pushing the allocation of federal land to cover up the fact that he vetoed every single housing bill last session that would have alleviated the crisis for everyday Nevadans. Firearm policies La Rue Hatch said she grew up on a ranch and practiced with firearms. During the 2023 legislative session, she said she voted for three gun control measures that Lombardo later vetoed and would support those measures again. “Those three measures were not extreme, they were not taking away anyone’s rights,” she said. “They were simply making our community safer.” She pointed to one of the three bills that would have raised the age to buy an assault weapon to 21. She said some of her students are 18, and they could conceivably buy a gun and bring it to school with them. La Rue Hatch said that her daughter, who is in second grade, has done active shooter drills since kindergarten, memorizing cutesy rhymes about staying quiet and hiding in a corner. “That is horrifying,” La Rue Hatch said. “What I will always advocate for is data-based policies that reduce incidents of gun violence.” Sande said she supported gun control measures but didn’t want to infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. She said any proposed gun legislation should consider the benefits and drawbacks. Tax credits On a proposed film tax credit expansion, La Rue Hatch said she has been very vocal in her opposition to what she views as “massive giveaways of public dollars.” Public dollars should stay in public services, she said, arguing that research from other states with film tax credit expansions shows that there isvery little return on investment. Sande said she is open to discussing a film tax credit expansion plan that would benefit Nevadans, especially people from underserved communities. She said she would have supported funding the A’s stadium. Looking at the business implications and job growth, Sande said the legislation made sense.“It’s very exciting,” she said. “There’s a big baseball presence here and having another team, a professional team … always helps these communities.” La Rue Hatch voted against providing public funding for the Oakland A’s stadium, a decision she stands by, pointing out that her community was, and still is, opposed to the legislation. “Until our schools are fully funded and our unhoused folks on the street have a place to go and our mental health systems are functioning, we can’t afford to give this money away,” she said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/harris-campaign-courts-lds-voters-in-nevada-banking-on-jan-6-distaste-for-trump,True,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is making a play for a group of Nevada voters who have long been the safest of bets for Republicans — members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Harris campaign is launching a Latter-day Saints (LDS) for Harris-Walz Advisory Committee, following anidentical effortin Arizona. With the race virtually tied in both states, the campaign believes improving its margins with the traditionally conservative group will be critical to win. In coordinating the public endorsements of prominent church members and engaging in formal outreach, the Harris campaign believes it can provide a permission structure for LDS voters skeptical of former President Donald Trump to abandon the Republican Party. “We're taught that contention is not of the Lord,” said Andy Hafen, a former Democratic mayor of Henderson serving on the advisory committee. “And that's what we're seeing a lot now, is contention, and I think that is really a big part of former President Trump's makeup, and we need to get away from that.” Courting Latter-day Saints voters will be an uphill battle for the Harris campaign — and one they expect to lose outright. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as Mormons, are among the most Republican religious groups in the U.S. A survey of partisanship among religious groups by thePew Research Centerin April found that 75 percent of Latter-day Saints identify as Republicans, second only to white evangelical Protestants. Typicallysocially conservativeand known for impressive voter turnout and political organizing, Nevada’s community of more than 180,000 Latter-day Saints — mostly concentrated in Clark County — have most often been courted in Republican presidential primaries rather than general elections. In Nevada, Latter-day Saints make up 6 percent of the population — a number that includes children but is a significantly larger figure than the 2.5 percentage points that Biden won by in 2020. The Harris campaign believes it can convince enough independent-learning and Republican Latter-day Saints to vote for its candidate — or select “none of the above” in the presidential race — to be meaningful in a state where races can be decided by fewerthan10,000 votes. Going after Republican-leaning groups such as Latter-day Saints may also prove necessary if Harris loses ground relative to Biden’s 2020 mark with more traditionally Democratic groups such asyoung votersandLatino voters, both large populations in Nevada where polling suggests Trump is improving upon his 2020 totals. The advisory committee, which includes local leaders across the state, plans to engage in LDS voter contact, host events, do traditional canvassing through the coordinated campaign and make appeals within their religious community to try to identify and persuade Trump-skeptical Latter-day Saints that they should not only pass on Trump, but vote for Harris. The Trump campaign is engaged in Latter-day Saints outreach as well. Trump hosted church officials at Mar-a-Lago, theNew York Timesreported, and his campaign plans to highlight actions he took during his presidency to promote religious freedom and defend Christianity, including issuingrulesallowing employers to only hire employees who align with their religious beliefs and churches to participate in politics while maintaining their tax-exempt status. And Trump has theendorsementof every Latter-day Saint in Congress, save for Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT). “In the last four years under Kamala Harris, Democrats have abandoned the Mormon community and led the charge on an attack on the freedom of religion and religious institutions,” said Halee Dobbins, the Republican National Committee communications director for Nevada. “Their silence on key issues vital to Mormon values has been deafening … In contrast, President Trump has consistently stood with believers by protecting religious institutions, appointing constitutionalist justices, and defending Christian values nationally and abroad.” But the partnership between LDS voters and Trump has oftenbeenuncomfortable, and Democrats have made gains during the last eight years. In 2016, Trump won Utah with just 45 percent of the vote, the lowest total for a Republican candidate in the Latter-day Saints-heavy state in more than 20 years. While voter data in Nevada is not available, a study of Latter-day Saints voting in Arizona between 2016 and 2020 showed promising signs for Democrats — President Joe Bidenwon18 percent of the state’s Latter-day Saints voters, doubling Hillary Clinton’s 2016 total en route to narrowly flipping Arizona. There is a long list of LDS members who have been elected in Nevada as Republicans, including former Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV), former Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison and former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, who is now running for Congress. But Democrats are not starting from scratch in the Silver State. The most influential politician in Nevada’s history, the late Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), was a Latter-day Saints Democrat. Having converted to the faith in college, Reid maintained that the church’s teachings motivated his partisan ideology, particularly on combating poverty. His longtime Latter-day Saint aide Megan Jones now serves as a senior political adviser on Harris’ campaign. Rory Reid, his son and a longtime Clark County commissioner who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010, said recruiting Latter-day Saints voters is inherently challenging for Democrats — but that this election presents a unique opportunity. “As a rule, Mormons tend to value American institutions,” Reid said. “I think what the Harris campaign should say that is that if you care about American institutions, and if you're sitting in a room with your kids and your grandkids and America's president gets on the screen and begins to talk, if you want to be proud of that person, then you should consider somebody other than Donald Trump.” Making the case for Harris Even the most optimistic believers in a growing Latter-day Saints Democratic constituency acknowledge that the opportunity for Harris lies in the unique matchup she faces against Trump. Latter-day Saints believe that the U.S. Constitution is a divinely inspired document that they have a responsibility to uphold. Harris’ Latter-day Saints supporters in Nevada think that Trump’s attempted subversion of the electoral process in 2020, first through court cases and then in the attempted insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, will be a powerful motivator for their community come November. Trump alsocalled forthe termination of the Constitution in 2022 over his unproven claims of election fraud. “For many of these voters, Jan. 6, at that point, was just a disqualifying factor,” said Daniel Stewart, a former Republican who worked on campaigns for Romney and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) but is now backing Harris. Members of the advisory committee see their goal as twofold — make their peers feel comfortable abandoning a Republican given those concerns, at least at the top of the ticket, and affirmatively make the case that they should vote for Harris. In 2023, the church itself, which is politically neutral, gave implicit permission for members to vote Democrat. In a letter from the First Presidency, the governing body of the church, leaderswarnedof the dangers of straight-ticket voting, encouraging members to research candidates carefully. Simply voting for all candidates of one party without careful study is a “threat to democracy,” the letter reads. Latter-day Saints Democrats in Nevada described this as a watershed moment, particularly in a faith that prides itself on its uniformity. Kendal Davis Weisenmiller, a Latter-day Saints Democrat in Las Vegas, said she believes many members of her community have privately come to the conclusion that Trump’s candidacy is inconsistent with their values, but are nervous to discuss it for fear of inciting division. She sees her job as presenting the affirmative case for Harris as someone who better symbolizes the church’s values — and ensuring that her fellow churchgoers know that they’re not alone if they’re considering voting Democrat. “I’m always really quick to point out that Vice President Harris has a really committed record of public service — her commitment to the rule of law, equal justice for all, nobody being above the law and just basic human dignity, serving our fellow men,” Davis Weisenmiller said. “Those are all things that align with our values or our goals that we strive to meet as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” Still, the Harris campaign can be an awkward fit on some issues important to Latter-day Saints — abortion chief among them. The church opposes elective abortions except in cases of rape, incest and a threat to the life of the mother or fetus. And while itsguidancehas changed over time, the church opposes same-sex marriage within its ranks. Plenty of Latter-day Saints from Utah will be crossing the border into Nevada throughcanvassing tripsplanned by the Utah Republican Party, speaking about issues where Latter-day Saints and Republicans traditionally align. But Latter-day Saints Democrats believe they can emphasize other issues. As a religious minority, Latter-day Saints have long been advocates against religious discrimination given their history — the LDS churchreleaseda statement encouraging governments to prioritize ending refugees’ suffering after Trump’s 2017 travel ban on predominantly Muslim nations. Stewart said he believes Latter-day Saints’ values on immigration more closely align with Harris’ more tolerant approach; Davis Weisenmiller said Latter-day Saints moms are deeply concerned about gun violence. And the Harris campaign believes a character-based pitch will be poignant with Latter-day Saints moms as well, who they believe struggle to reconcile Trump’s insult-laden rhetoric with how they encourage their kids to behave. “I think that you're seeing a lot more Mormon women saying, Whoa, every time [Trump] opens his mouth, [he] is ‘other’-ing people,” said Jones, Harris’ senior adviser. “There's no empathy there. And so they're looking to see, what kind of leader is Kamala Harris? And I think the contrast is very clear.” The Harris campaign is also hoping to capitalize onyounger Latter-day Saints, who are less conservative than their forebears. As Gen Z Latter-day Saints enter the voting pool, the Harris campaign believes improved margins even with generational groups can make a difference. “With an election this close, it’s one of those things where any improvement — not only on 2020 — but any improvement on what the campaigns may have even been seeing from four months ago, would be welcomed and could make a difference,” Stewart said.",Error: Connection error.

The two served together as Democrats in the state Senate, representing neighboring districts, for eight years. From 2009 to 2012, Horsford even served as Lee’s majority leader. Horsford went on to represent Nevada’s 4th Congressional District, anchored by North Las Vegas; Lee to serve as the majority-minority city’s mayor. More than a decade later, their careers are crossing paths again — but this time, they’re opponents. Lee, now a Republican, is challenging Horsford. Despite their longtime familiarity, Horsford, in an interview, didn’t offer any thoughts as to how or why Lee had changed since their time as colleagues. “My opponent, in my view, is an opportunistic candidate who is aligning with Donald Trump,” Horsford said. Lee, a businessman,changed partiesto become a Republican in 2021, nearly eight years into his term as North Las Vegas mayor. Shortly after, he mounted a failed gubernatorial bid — his first run as a Republican. This cycle, armed with an endorsement from Trump, he won the June primary for the chance to defeat his old colleague. Lee didn’t have any fondness for his former colleague either. “It's the same old Horsford I've always known,” Lee said in an interview. “There's no difference, no change. [I’m] not impressed.” Horsford, a Las Vegas native, was the 4th Congressional District’s first-ever representative when it was created as a result of the 2010 Census, containing northern Clark County and the vast, sparsely populated rural counties in the center of the state. (Ironically, Lee explored running in 2011 but ultimately dropped out in favor of Horsford, who hecalleda “great candidate” at the time.) After serving one term, he lost in the red wave of 2014 to then-Assemblyman Cresent Hardy (R-NV). Democrats regained the seat in 2016 and have controlled it ever since; Horsford returned in 2018 and has won his last three elections. Nevada politicos in both parties agree the experience of losing made him a strong campaigner, running as if he is behind even though the district has been shored up for Democrats — who have a 7 percent voter registrationadvantage— and is typically categorized as “lean” blue. Horsford’s national profile has risen during his congressional tenure as well, culminating in his being named chair of the storied Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) in 2023. His CBC leadership is part of the reason that national Republican groups have been wary to enter the race, knowing that any dollar they put in will be doubled by Democratic groups. Each candidate’s advertising totals convey the dynamics of the race — and what an uphill climb Lee faces. Horsford’s campaign and Democrat-aligned groups have spent more than $3 million and have reserved an additional nearly $3 million in October and November spending. Lee, standing on his own, has spent just $76,000 and has no future advertisements booked. “John Lee has some appeal,” said David Damore, a political scientist at UNLV. “[It’s] an interesting race for the personality makeup. But I think that Horsford, given his history and the access he's going to have to national money, that the Republicans are going to really struggle there to match him.” Who is John Lee? Lee, who has lived in Southern Nevada since moving to North Las Vegas at the age of 6, has served in various government positions during the years, including the Assembly, the state Senate and eventually the mayor’s office in North Las Vegas. During his mayoralty, he took on the city’sfiscal challengesand pursued economic development, including the creation of Apex Industrial Park. Throughout his career in public service, Lee also owned and operated a successful plumbing business, the source of much of his personal wealth. Lee sold the business in 2017. His personal financial disclosure lists the value of his assets at between $13.8 million and $37.2 million — a total that would likely make him thewealthiest memberof the Nevada delegation, if elected. The wide range is related to how the personal financial disclosure system works: Candidates report the value of their assets in broad categories, such as $5 million to $25 million. Lee’s assets, held in limited liability corporations and retirement accounts, include real estate, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, U.S. Treasury bills and mutual fund holdings. Horsford’s assets, by contrast, areworthbetween $45,000 and $150,000. Horsford owns one home, his primary residence in Las Vegas, and is liable for a mortgage worth between $100,000 and $250,000. He reports no other earned income beyond his congressional salary. Lee, along with his wife, currently owns and rents out three commercial properties in Clark County, per Clark County property records. Their tenants include an auto repair shop in North Las Vegas, a TV repair business, insurance company and traffic control business, a mold remediation business and a concrete contractor. He expects to make between $115,000 and $250,000 in rent this year. “These properties reflect my ongoing dedication to supporting Nevada's local economy,” Lee said in a statement. Because Lee has maintained a complex constellation of businesses and a family trust, a full accounting of his property ownership over the years is difficult to ascertain. Lee lists a home he rents in Aliante, North Las Vegas, as his primary residence. But he has various ties to southwestern Utah as well. The only home he owns, according to his campaign, is a six-bedroom vacation house in southwestern Utah worth an estimated $1.4 million. Lee said he occasionally visits his Utah home for family vacations, but that his “home and heart are right here in North Las Vegas.” Race dynamics Congressional District 4 is 3 percentage points more Democratic than the nation, according to the Cook Partisan Voting Index, and has voted in recent cycles as such — Horsford won by about 5 points in 2022. Given that Lee is independently wealthy and the only Republican challenger to have held elected office, experts and political consultants in Nevada and Washington, D.C., consider this race to be the most competitive of the cycle. The Horsford campaign is treating it as such. Horsford has been an active fundraiser and hired a campaign manager with rural experience to try to improve his margins in rural central Nevada as well. To that end, his campaign says it has seen increased volunteer activity relative to prior cycles in Pahrump, Mesquite, Tonopah and on Native American reservations. In North Las Vegas, the Horsford campaign has found its messaging around housing affordability to be a winner, particularly among persuadable independent voters. It’s a traditional Nevada Democratic campaign that includes door-to-door paid canvassing since June through the coordinated campaign and holding culturally sensitive events with various communities. The Lee campaign, meanwhile, is banking on crossover voting, particularly among the district’s sizable Latino population, who make up about 34 percent of Congressional District 4. Their modeling suggests that half of Latino voters are willing to vote for a member of the opposing party — to that end, nearly all of Lee’s spending, from signs to digital advertisements, have been in Spanish. Lee has been significantly outspent — a reality his campaign has accepted. Without the resources to compete on the airwaves with Horsford, they’re banking on their outreach to their target demographic. The Lee campaign also believes Trump will lose the district, as he did in 2020, so their candidate has to run ahead of him — hence the focus on crossover voters. Thus far, outside Republican groups are keeping an eye on the race, but their lack of spending indicates that they don’t feel optimistic enough about Lee’s chances to invest. While House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has included Las Vegas on his fundraising schedule, planning to host an event with Lee next week, neither the National Republican Congressional Committee nor the leadership-connected Congressional Leadership Fund have spent a dollar in the race. The Horsford campaign believes that its better-funded campaign operation and an uptick in Democratic enthusiasm, particularly with key groups such as men of color, since President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, will carry the day. “I'm confident that in November, the voters of this district will appoint me to another two years to continue to fight for them, as I've done,” Horsford said. On policy TAXES Lee and Horsford list tax policy as top agenda items for 2025, and for good reason — the 2017 Trump tax cuts expire next year, making it a focus for the next Congress. Horsford, who was recently reinstated to the Ways & Means Committee, the influential tax writing panel, introduced theTIPS Actto end taxation on tips as well as eliminate the subminimum wage for tipped workers. He also wants to expand thechild tax credit, which Democrats did on a temporary basis in 2021; the expansion has since expired. “My focus is on helping everyday Nevadans have more fair and equitable tax policy, as well as helping our small businesses have the tax credits and deductions that they need to continue to grow their business and hire more Nevada workers,” he said. Lee, meanwhile, wants to renew the Trump tax cuts, and, in accordance with Trump pledges, remove taxes on Social Security benefits and overtime pay. HOUSING Horsford also named housing as a key issue for him — he’s introduced abilltocrack downon corporate investors buying up home stock, an issue that’s beenprevalentin North Las Vegas. Lee’s housing strategy is to change course on energy policy, which he believes will unlock lower prices across sectors. “If we control the energy challenges this country has with gas and oil and all those things, things will be naturally cheaper because we won't be sending our natural resources over to other places and have them refined, or buying more product from other locations,” he said. If elected, Lee said he would like to join the Natural Resources and Veterans’ Affairs committees, given the importance of land issues in the district and its large population of veterans. Horsford sits on Ways & Means and the Armed Services Committee. Lee said he does not support theClark County lands bill, a proposal from Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) to release more federal land in the Las Vegas Valley for development in exchange for permanently protecting about 2 million acres of land in Southern Nevada for conservation purposes. Instead, Lee said he would like to see federal land in the Las Vegas Valley transferred to the state and then auctioned off, with certain parcels reserved for municipalities for charter schools, Veterans Affairs facilities and affordable housing. “Coming from a mayor's position, I was handcuffed that I could not do more of the better things that our community needed because of the availability of land and to zone it properly,” Lee said. IMMIGRATION Immigration and the border have also proven to be a key issue in the race. Rather than avoid the border, an area thatvoterstrustRepublicans more on, Horsford mentioned it in hisfirst ad, saying he worked in a bipartisan manner to secure more funding for the border. He frequently mentions his support of the bipartisan border bill, whichfailedin the Senate after Republicans, following Trump’s lead, voted down a proposal to crack down on border crossings and restrict asylum. Trumppannedit as bad policy and Republicans werehesitantto give Democrats any political victory on an issue critical to Trump’s chances to win the presidential election. Lee, like most Republicans, wants to see more border wall construction. But he also did not go as far as Trump, whose endorsement he has welcomed and whose rallies he has appeared at, in calling for mass deportation. He said although those who commit crimes should be deported, he wants to protect long-term undocumented residents of North Las Vegas. “They're living the American life right now,” he said. “They're adding to the community by being good members, and the jobs that they do in our community are needed. I'm not for hurting any of those people.” ABORTION Horsford has repeatedly called Lee out on abortion. While running for governor in 2021, Leesaidhe was in favor of a “heartbeat bill,” which prohibits abortion once a fetus’ heartbeat can be detected, typically considered six weeks in Republican proposals — with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Lee now says abortion is a state’s rights issue, although Nevada law could be superseded by a national abortion ban in Congress. In Nevada, he said he plans to vote against Question 6, which would enshrine the right to an abortion up to the point of fetal viability in the state’s Constitution. Horsford said Lee’s views are extreme and endanger Nevadans. “My opponent refers to himself as a1950s guy, but the 1950s weren't all that great for a lot of women, a lot of people of color, a lot of hard working people in Nevada,” Horsford said. “And we're not going back. We're focused on moving Nevada forward.” BLACK CONSTITUENTS Lee alsocame under firefor comments he made at a September event, first obtained byThe Huffington Post, disparaging Horsford’s CBC leadership and saying that, as the former mayor of North Las Vegas, he was “not worried about Black people” in the race. Fifteen percent of the district is Black. When asked to clarify, Lee said he’s had support from Black voters in every race he’s run — though he referred to Black Americans as “Blacks” multiple times, which can be viewed as insensitive. “That's never been an issue,” he said. “I'm not worried about do the Blacks know me well enough to vote for me and not Horsford. I get along very, very well. Thirty percent of our community is African American.” In apost, Horsford said he was concerned with how all members of the district are doing, including Black people.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/democrats-call-for-dismissal-of-gop-lawsuit-alleging-noncitizens-on-nevada-voter-rolls,True,"Democrats are seeking to dismiss aGOP lawsuitthat alleged Nevada officials have failed to remove noncitizens from its voter rolls, calling them “recycled allegations” from four years ago based on “no actual evidence.” In amotionfiled Friday on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and Nevada Democratic Party, a Carson City judge was asked to toss out the Republican lawsuit from mid-September. It argues the state already has a robust process for ensuring noncitizens do not vote (which is illegal nationwide) and accuses Republicans of seeking a “drastic change” in the home stretch of the election cycle that is not allowed under federal laws. Thelawsuit, filed by former President Donald Trump’s campaign along with the Nevada GOP and Republican National Committee, accused state election officials of not adopting regulations to verify that people on the voter rolls are citizens and that the state has not systematically removed noncitizens from the voter rolls. It says this disadvantages Republicans, and calls for the judge to require officials to conduct systematic voter roll maintenance ahead of the November election. The lawsuit was the fourth filed by national Republican organizations this year in Nevada, and all other three have either been dismissed or denied but are in various stages of appeal. Republicans have said these lawsuits are necessary to bolster trust in elections, but Democrats argue the suits are destined to fail and are simply aploy to diminish trustin elections. “Republicans are running on Trump’s undemocratic, un-American playbook to baselessly sow doubt in our free and fair election,” Amahree Archie, a spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, said in a statement. “They are inventing instances of voter fraud and claiming that eligible voters shouldn’t be registered — all because they know they can’t win this election fair and square.” Astudyby the Brennan Center for Justice found that election officials who oversaw 23.5 million votes in the 2016 election referred only about 30 incidents of noncitizen voting for further investigation. In its motion to dismiss, the Democrats referred to the state’s existing processes to ensure noncitizens cannot vote. The state’s voter registration form’s first question asks about a person’s citizenship, Nevadans can allege that a registered voter is a noncitizen and there are federal laws that classify noncitizens who seek to vote as “inadmissible,” subjecting them to possible deportation or ban on returning to the U.S. The motion also refers to federal law that prohibits any systematic alteration of a state’s voter rolls less than 90 days before an election. The lawsuit was filed well after that deadline, and another Republican-led voter roll lawsuit in Nevadawas dismissedearlier this year in part because of this restriction. “Plaintiffs have no constitutional right to burden Nevada voters (and election officials) by demanding the Court impose such a new, extra statutory requirement less than six weeks before election day,” the motion read. The lawsuit claimed that thousands of noncitizens were on the voter rolls in December 2020, “many of whom cast a ballot,” but such reports of election fraud weredismissedby then-Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican who found no evidence of foreign nationals voting. However, the suit accused Cegavske of an insufficient analysis. Instead, Republicans cited a biannual survey from Harvard University’sCooperative Election Studywhere about 4 percent of self-reported noncitizens claimed they were registered to vote. Republicans also referred to public records allegedly finding that about 8 percent of the prospective jury pool in Washoe County District Court claimed disqualification because they were noncitizens — and that jury pools are in part compiled through voter registration lists. Democrats said the GOP lawsuit is based on faulty allegations. “They make this extraordinary request based on recycled allegations that some of the Plaintiffs made — and election officials rejected — after the 2020 election,” the motion said. “Nothing has changed since then.” ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-distrust-in-u-s-elections-remains-in-nevada-but-state-elections-seen-as-fair,True,"More than 30 percent of Nevadans are not confident in the security of American elections this year, but a much higher number are confident in the integrity of Nevada’s elections, a recent poll found. Theresults, shared exclusively withThe Nevada Independent,found that about 14 percent of Nevadans were not confident in the state’s elections, including 22 percent of Republicans. There is much less trust in nationwide elections, with 31 percent of Nevadans and nearly half of GOP respondents expressing distrust that those races would be run properly. “Everybody tends to have a much better feeling about where they live and the honesty and integrity of their neighbors and colleagues,” said Dave Sackett, partner at The Tarrance Group, the GOP pollster that conducted the survey. “People just sort of think that the election system is in better shape here.” The findings underscore the lingering distrust of the nation’s elections after Republicans — led by former President Donald Trump — pushed unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. The poll found that more than one-third of Nevadans viewed President Joe Biden’s victory as illegitimate (including two-thirds of Republicans) and that about 40 percent were either extremely or very concerned that the 2024 results could be imperiled by irregularities. The survey of 600 likely voters in mid-September was conducted on behalf of the Democracy Defense Project (DDP), a nonprofit designed tobuild trust in electionswhose Nevada branch is co-led by former Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval and former Democratic Assembly Speaker Richard Perkins. The pollalso foundVice President Kamala Harris with a slight lead over Trump in this year’s presidential race. “I’m pleased with the fact that Nevadans have a lot more confidence in the Nevada system than the national system,” said Perkins, who attributed it to yearslong efforts to improve election trust in the state. “It just means we're doing something right.” About 37 percent of respondents said they were very confident that the casting and counting of ballots in the state is secure. About 24 percent were not confident, including 42 percent of Republicans and 27 percent of independents. Although Democrats are more likely to have faith in elections, some Democrats polled were also wary of improper behavior. More than 60 percent of Democrats said they were concerned that Trump and the GOP would engage in improper ballot activities, and about 70 percent of Republicans surveyed were concerned about the same behaviors from Democrats. Democrats have said that national Republicans' slew of election-related lawsuits in Nevada are aplan to sow distrust. Those lawsuits center on the state’s maintenance of voter rolls and mail ballot laws — key elements of the state’s electoral system. Perkins said he thinks these types of long-shot lawsuits and rhetoric that casts doubt on elections play a role in lowering trust. “Some folks will read into [the lawsuits] how they want to read into it, and it creates that bias,” he said. “The rest of it, though, is still the speeches, the rallies.” In addition, more than half of respondents said they trust election workers to count ballots fairly, while about 40 percent said that these employees are more partisan than they appear and need to be monitored closely to avoid benefitting their preferred candidate. In an interview, Sandoval said trust in election workers can be bolstered through education. “Once people understand and become more familiar with the processes with regard to election workers and the safeguards in place, they'll feel better about it,” Sandoval said. “It’s DDP’s job to really get the information out there about [that] and that these are good people that are doing yeoman's work in terms of making sure that we have safe and secure elections.” The poll also asked respondents what they considered the biggest threats to election integrity. Notably, none of the most common answers dealt with actual election processes and instead included the media’s role in election coverage, artificial intelligence creating misinformation and foreign propaganda influencing elections. Pollsters also found wide support for a slew of election-related reforms, many of which are already policies in Nevada, such as paper ballots being stored in locked facilities and ensuring that voting machines are not connected to the internet. Sackett said this underscores the importance of informing voters about the state’s election security laws. “Simple messaging that sort of talks about the basic things that are being done really can have a very significant impact across the board,” he said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/majority-of-nevadans-support-voter-id-harris-gaining-over-trump,True,"Vice President Kamala Harris has a slight edge over former President Donald Trump in Nevada and Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) has a more substantial lead over Republican Sam Brown, according to a survey conducted by a national Republican pollster. Thepollalso found that a voter ID ballot question will easily pass, with more than two-thirds of voters supporting the proposition. The survey was conducted by The Tarrance Group, an experienced GOP opinion-taker in the Silver State, for the Democracy Defense Project, a bipartisan initiative dedicated to upholding the transparency, security and legitimacy of Nevada’s elections. The poll surveyed 600 likely voters from throughout the state Sept. 16-19 via telephone and has a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points. The poll also found that Harris leads Trump 47 percent to 44 percent, echoing a close race found in other recent polling. Four percent chose the unique Nevada option of ""None of These Candidates,"" 4 percent were undecided and 1 percent chose a third-party candidate. Respondentsalso saidthey were more likely to distrust the American election system than Nevada's process. Dave Sackett, partner at The Tarrance Group, the GOP pollster that conducted the survey, cautioned against placing too much faith in these results, especially given that the results fall within the margin of error and emphasizing that this is just a snapshot during that time period. Although the Democratic presidential candidate has won Nevadain the past four elections,the margin of victory has become increasingly smaller. “There’s just too much fluidity,” Sackett said. “I think anybody who tells you that they know for certain what's going to happen in Nevada wouldn't declare it.” The poll also found that Rosen continues to lead over Brown, 48 percent to 41 percent. Six percent were undecided, and the rest chose none of the above or a third party hopeful. Rosen has led Brown in almost every public poll released this year, often outside the margin of error. As Democrats, Harris and Rosen take the lead roughly a month before Election Day, a majority of Nevadans — 71 percent — support requiring an ID to vote, according to the September poll shared exclusively withThe Nevada Independent. On voter ID, the poll found that Question 7 has 71 percent fo voters saying they would vote yes. Ninety-two percent of Republicans, 49 percent of Democrats and 73 percent of independents said they support the idea, an effort being led by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. “There is absolutely no surprise here,” Sackett said. Question 7 would amend the Nevada Constitution to require all in-person voters in Nevada to present a valid photo identification and for mail-in voters to use a personal identification number, such as their Social Security number. Nevada isone of 14 statesthat does not require a form of identification while voting, relying instead on voters’ signatures for verification, although ID is required to register. Opponents contend that the measure could make it harder to vote — especially for Black and Latino voters. However, according to the poll, some 75 percent of Hispanic Nevadans are in favor of the measure, in comparison to the 70 percent of white Nevadans who support the measure. The poll found that union and nonunion households favored the measure by roughly 70 percent.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-nevadans-of-both-parties-against-new-tariff-hikes-trump-has-backed-the-concept,True,"Bipartisan majorities of Nevadans opposed raising tariffs on other countries by 10 percent to 20 percent — a policy proposal that former President Donald Trump has embraced on the campaign trail, repeatedly saying thathigher tariffs will fixa range of U.S. economic problems including high prices, the federal deficit and the cost of child care. But 69 percent of Nevadans said they would prefer keeping tariffs with other nations mutually low, in accordance with the rules governing world trade, instead of a tariff hike, according to a newpoll. While keeping tariffs low is more popular among Democrats (77 percent), a majority of Nevada Republicans — 60 percent — disagreed with Trump’s proposal. China, however, proved to be an exception to Nevadans’ belief in free trade orthodoxy — 72 percent of Nevadans support keeping 20 percent tariff rates on the import of Chinese goods. Trumpraisedtariffs on China for the import of certain goods in 2017, inciting a trade war; President Joe Biden kept many of those tariffs andaddednew ones on China. Economistsconcludedthat these tariffs raised revenue for the U.S. government but alsoamountedto a tax on consumers — most of the impact was borne by American companies buying from China rather than China itself. But they have remained popular among both parties. Trump is now proposingraisingtariffs on Chinese goods to 60 percent. The goal is to punish China for intellectual property theft violations and give American manufacturers a leg up. The poll was conducted by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy and is one of several issue-focused polls the group is conducting ahead of the election in swing states. This survey polled 594 Nevadans in online opt-in panels from Sept. 9-22, and has a margin of error of 4.6 percent. See our reports on Nevada polls onchild care,Social Securityandabortion. Tariffs are a tax on imported goods that companies must pay. A common foreign policy tool in the 19th and early 20th centuries, new tariffs were widely believed to haveworsenedthe Great Depression, causing other nations to raise tariffs in-kind and reducing exports and imports, contracting the economy. After World War II, as international cooperation grew and the postwar economic order took shape, nations pursued low tariffs and free trade agreements. Such policy is considered to have greatly improved the global and national standard of living, improving access to and affordability of new products, but also isfrequently blamedfor the offshoring of blue-collar jobs — a key theme in the 2016 election. A majority of Nevadans were receptive to arguments that free trade has undercut American workers, companies and sovereignty. But when asked to decide if they supported continuing international trade agreements based on low tariffs and agreed-upon rules, 80 percent said they approved of the current regime. “[The poll] could help [us] understand why, when candidates speak critically of trade, they probably see some heads nodding in terms of American manufacturing capacity,” said Steven Kull, a political psychologist at the University of Maryland and director of the Program for Public Consultation. “But then when they look at the big picture and the long-term benefits of trade, they come down quite clearly on [that] side. And that’s bipartisan.” Nevadans are also supportive of the U.S. making more bilateral trade agreements with other nations, including requirements that manufacturers meet certain labor and environmental standards, as it has with partners such as the European Union, South Korea, Canada and Mexico. Overwhelming majorities — 81 percent for labor standards and 77 percent for environmental standards — want to see these agreements expanded. Economists have issued dire warnings about Trump’sproposed tariffs, which include a 20 percent across-the-board import hike, an 100 percent tariff on Mexican goods and a 200 percent tariff on John Deere exports into the U.S. The former president has argued that doing so will keep U.S. companies from offshoring jobs. “We’re going to put big tariffs on those cars that are coming in here at 100 [percent] to 200 percent, and they’re no longer going to be competitive,” Trumpsaidof raising tariffs on Mexico in retaliation against American automakers moving jobs there. “So you better stay in Michigan.” Morgan Stanleyprojectsthat under Trump’s proposed tariff regime, 70,000 fewer jobs would be created each month. Economists at Goldman Sachsconcludedthat new tariffs would increase inflation and raise prices by 0.1 percent for each additional percent increase in the effective tariff rate.Estimatesplace the cost to the median American family at between $1,500and $4,000per year. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, hascalledTrump’s tariff proposals “not very serious,” preferring to raise the corporate tax rate. The costs argument was compelling to Nevadans in open-ended responses. “Seems like raising them will affect cost of living right now more,” one respondent wrote. “I can't afford to be paying more for stuff right now.” Nevada candidates rarely mention trade in their campaign websites — Congress hasrelinquishedmuch of its tariff and trade powers, giving the president enormous unilateral authority to impose duties on certain industries and countries. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) has beeninvolvedin tariff debates in Congress before, urging colleagues and the Biden administration to put off taxing imports on solar panels and parts in order to protect Nevada-based solar companies and jobs as the domestic solar manufacturing sector grows. A statement from her campaign said Rosen supports holding China accountable but that tariffs such as the ones Trump proposes would raise costs and amount to a “tax on the middle class.” “Donald Trump’s reckless trade agenda would lead to thousands of dollars in higher costs every year for hardworking Nevadans and Nevada small businesses,” the statement said.Rosen’s opponent, Sam Brown,toldThe Washington Examiner in a May interview that he supports free trade broadly, and that tariffs can amount to a tax on consumers, but considers China an exception. While he has echoed several of Trump’s economic policy calls, including to end taxation on tips and on Social Security benefits, he has been mum on Trump’s tariff pitches. His campaign did not respond to The Nevada Independent when asked if he supported Trump’s tariff hikes. On the House side, Rep. Dina Titus’ (D-NV) campaign said she did not support Trump’s plan to raise tariffs 10 percent to 20 percent on all imports and 60 percent on China, but was in favor of the U.S. expanding its bilateral trade agreements with labor and environmental standards. Greg Kidd, an independent challenging Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) in Congressional District 2, said he was against raising tariffs, citing the 1930s-era history, but would support new agreements involving other countries raising their labor and environmental standards, though he acknowledged such provisions can be difficult to enforce. “The thought that the other country pays the tariffs is nonsense,” Kidd said in a statement. “Tariffs are clearly just a tax on the American people. Always have been, always will be.” Amodei’s campaign staff said they were not able to comment on the issue in the provided time frame; Titus challenger Mark Robertson and the candidates in Congressional Districts 3 and 4 did not respond to questions. Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) has previouslyadvocatedagainst further solar tariffs; her challenger, Drew Johnson, has advocated against tariffs in op-eds during theTrumpandBidenadministrations, saying they contribute to higher prices.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/vance-and-walz-keep-it-civil-in-a-policy-heavy-discussion-vp-debate-takeaways,True,"By Bill Barrow, Zeke Miller, Nicholas Riccardi, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice presidential hopefulsTim WalzandJD Vancefocused their criticism on the top of the ticket on Tuesday as they engaged in a policy-heavy discussion that may bethe last debate of the 2024 presidential campaign. It was the first encounter between Minnesota's Democratic governor and Ohio's Republican senator, following last month's debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. It comes just five weeks before Election Day and as millions of voters are now able to cast early ballots. Tuesday's confrontation played out as the stakes of the contest rose again after Iran fired missiles into Israel, while a devastating hurricane and potentially debilitating port strike roiled the country at home. Over and again, Walz and Vance outlined the policy and character differences between their running mates, while trying to introduce themselves to the country. Here are some takeaways from Tuesday's debate. Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel on Tuesday elicited a contrast between the Democratic and Republican tickets on foreign policy: Walz promised ""steady leadership"" under Harris while Vance pledged a return to ""peace through strength"" if Trump is returned to the White House. The differing visions of what American leadership should look like overshadowed the sharp policy differences between the two tickets. The Iranian threat to the region and U.S. interests around the world opened the debate, with Walz pivoting the topic to criticism of Trump. ""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, then referenced the ""nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes"" and responding to global crises by tweet. Vance, for his part, promised a return to ""effective deterrence"" under Trump against Iran, brushing back on Walz's criticism of Trump by attacking Harris and her role in the Biden administration. ""Who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years and the answer is your running mate, not mine,"" he said. He pointedly noted that the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, happened ""during the administration of Kamala Harris."" Vance and Walz trained the bulk of their attacks not on their onstage rivals, but on the running mates who weren't in the room. Both vice presidential nominees sought to convey a genial mien as they lobbed criticism at Harris and Trump, respectively. It was a reflection of the fact that most voters don't cast a ballot based on the vice president, and on a vice presidential nominee's historic role in serving as the attack dog for their running mates. Walz pointedly attacked Trump for failing to meet his pledge of building a physical barrier across the entire U.S.-Mexico border at the country's southern neighbor's expense.""Less than 2 percent of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime,"" Walz said. Underscoring the focus on the top of the ticket, during a back-and-forth about immigration, Vance said to his opponent, ""I think that you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does."" It was a wonky policy debate, with talk of risk pools, housing regulations and energy policyIn an age of world-class disses optimized for social media, Tuesday's debate was a detour into substance. Both candidates took a low-key approach and both enthusiastically delved into the minutiae. Walz dug into the drafting of the Affordable Care Act when he was in the House in 2009, and pushed Vance on the senator's claim that Trump, who tried to eliminate the law, actually helped preserve it. Vance, defending his claim that illegal immigration pushes up housing prices, cited a Federal Reserve study to back himself up. Walz talked about how Minneapolis tinkered with local regulations to boost the housing supply. Both men talked about the overlap between energy policy, trade and climate change. It was a very different style than often seen in presidential debates over the past several election cycles. Walz pounced on Vance repeatedly over abortion access and reproductive rights as the Ohio senator tried to argue that a state-by-state matrix of abortion laws is the ideal approach for the United States. Walz countered that a ""basic right"" for a woman should not be determined ""by geography."" ""This is a very simple proposition: These are women's decisions,"" Walz said. ""We trust women. We trust doctors."" Walz sought to personalize the issue by referencing the death of Amber Thurman, who waited more than 20 hours at the hospital for a routine medical procedure known as a D&C to clear out remaining tissue after taking abortion pills. She developed sepsis and died.Rather than sidestep the reference, Vance at one point agreed with Walz that ""Amber Thurman should still be alive."" Vance steered the conversation to the GOP ticket's proposals he said would help women and children economically, thus avoiding the need for terminating pregnancies. But Walz retorted that such policies — tax credits, expanded childcare aid, a more even economy — can be pursued while still allowing women to make their own decisions about abortion. In the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Helene, Vance took a question about climate change and gave an answer about jobs and manufacturing, taking a detour around Trump's past claims that global warming is a ""hoax."" Vance contended that the best way to fight climate change was to move more manufacturing to the United States, because the country has the world's cleanest energy economy. It was a distinctly domestic spin on a global crisis, especially after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the international Paris climate accords during his administration. Walz also kept the climate change focus domestic, touting the Biden administration's renewable energy investments as well as record levels of oil and natural gas production. ""You can see us becoming an energy superpower in the future,"" Walz said. It was a decidedly optimistic take on a pervasive and grim global problem. Walz, Vance each blame opposing presidential candidate for immigration stalemateThe two running mates agreed that the number of migrants in the U.S. illegally is a problem. But each laid the blame on the opposing presidential nominee. Vance echoed Trump by repeatedly calling Harris the ""border czar"" and suggested that she, as vice president, single-handedly rolled back the immigration restrictions Trump had imposed as president. The result, in Vance's telling, is an unchecked flow of fentanyl, strain on state and local resources and increased housing prices around the country. Harris was never asked to be the ""border czar"" and she was never specifically given the responsibility for security on the border. She was tasked by Biden in March 2021 with tackling the ""root causes"" of migration from the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and pushing leaders there and in Mexico to enforce immigration laws. Harris was not empowered to set U.S. immigration policy — only the president can sign executive orders and Harris was not empowered as Biden's proxy in negotiations with Congress on immigration law. Walz advanced Democrats' arguments that Trump single-handedly killed a bipartisan Senate deal to tighten border security and boost the processing system for immigrants and asylum seekers. Republicans backed off the deal, Walz noted, only after Trump said it wasn't good enough. Asked directly whether Trump's promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants would remove parents of U.S.-born children, Vance never answered the question. Instead, the senator tried to put his best spin on Trump's plan to use the military to help with deportations and pivot to attacking Harris for a porous border. Asked to respond to Trump's having called climate change a ""hoax,"" Vance also avoided a response. The debate kicked off with Walz being asked if he'd support a preemptive strike by Israel against Iran. Walz praised Harris' foreign policy leadership but never answered that question, either. And at the end of the debate, Vance would not answer Walz's direct question of whether Trump indeed lost the 2020 election. Walz had several verbal stumbles on a night in which he admitted to ""misspeaking"" often. In the debate's opening moments, he confused Iran and Israel when discussing the Middle East. At one point he said he had ""become friends with school shooters,"" and he stumbled through an explanation of inaccurate remarks about whether he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. ( He was not.) But the governor noticeably put Vance on the defensive over abortion and, near the end of the debate, with a pointed question about whether Trump won the 2020 election. The candidates went out of their way to be polite to each other until the very end, when Vance refused to back down from his statements that he wouldn't have certified Trump's 2020 election loss. Vance tried to turn the issue to claims that the ""much bigger threat to democracy"" was Democrats trying to censor people on social media. But Walz wouldn't let go. ""This one is troubling to me,"" said Walz, noting that he'd just been praising some of Vance's answers. He rattled off the ways Trump tried to overturn his 2020 loss and noted that the candidate still insists he won that contest. Then Walz asked Vance if Trump actually lost the election. Vance responded by asking if Harris censored people. ""That is a damning non-answer,"" said Walz, noting that Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, wasn't on the debate stage because he stood up to Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, and presided over Congress' certification of the former president's loss. ""America,"" Walz concluded, ""I think you've got a really clear choice on this election of who's going to honor that democracy and who's going to honor Donald Trump.""",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/as-gop-files-and-loses-election-lawsuits-in-nevada-dems-say-its-a-plan-to-sow-distrust,True,"Four years after Republicansfailedin their attempts to challenge President Joe Biden’s victory in Nevada, the GOP has ramped up its pre-election legal efforts. The Republican National Committee (RNC) — often along with the Nevada Republican Party and former President Donald Trump’s campaign — has already filed four election-related lawsuits in the Silver State, and the groups are increasing their number of lawyers on standby on Election Day. The strategy is part of the Republican effort to litigate the ins and outs of election processes in battleground states, which the groups say is necessary to improve trust in elections. Faith in the country’s election systemshas erodedsince Trump and his allies pushed unfounded claims of widespread election fraud four years ago. “These unprecedented measures are designed to bolster voters’ confidence in the election process and uphold the principles of free and fair elections in our state,” Nevada GOP Chairman Michael McDonald said in a statement toThe Nevada Independentafter declining multiple interview requests. It’s not uncommon for political parties to pursue election-related lawsuits — Nevada Democrats, for example, successfully sued to block theGreen PartyandRobert F. Kennedy Jr.from appearing on the November ballot — but Republicans are much more likely to use the tactic this cycle. Ananalysisfrom Democracy Docket, a publication founded by well-known Democratic attorney Marc Elias, found the GOP has filed 51 lawsuits nationwide this cycle, compared to nine by Democrats. Critics of the GOP’s lawsuits in Nevada say they are acting in particular bad faith, filed and promoted under the guise of advancing election integrity, when in reality they further prompt distrust of election systems and serve as public relations channels for a campaign that has repeatedly claimed they will only lose this year’s presidential election if Democrats conduct widespread cheating. In one of the lawsuits filed, a Republican attorney acknowledged the issue likely could not be resolved before Election Day. A recently filed suit alleging noncitizens on voter rolls also has no realistic chance of being addressed before ballots are cast because of federal rules on amending voter rolls. ""Most of these lawsuits are filed without any hope of winning, and I don't think they even care. The point is to increase mistrust and confusion, so the results can be attacked as illegitimate,"" Bradley Schrager, the Nevada Democratic Party’s general counsel, said in a statement. Just as in 2020, the legal challenges have failed so far. Three of the four lawsuits have resulted in Republican defeats and are in various stages of appeal, while the fourth was recently filed and has not yet been decided, though its chance of success seems to be an extreme longshot. Ben Berwick, counsel for Protect Democracy, a group focused on combating authoritarianism nationwide, said he thinks Republicans know they are likely to lose these lawsuits and will use those defeats to foment distrust after Election Day. “[They will] claim that we don't really know the true outcome, that certain categories of ballots should be thrown out as illegitimate, that there is fraud, that noncitizens are voting, that the voter rolls can't be trusted,” Berwick said. “And I think we will see that both as the basis to argue that this county shouldn't certify their results, and also probably as a basis to bring post-election litigation.” The Nevada GOP is quick to take credit for the removal of about 100,000 inactive voters last month from the state’s voter rolls — McDonald highlighted it in his statement — though officials have said the purge was part of routine voter roll maintenance conducted by counties. Lawsuits The four lawsuits filed by the RNC in Nevada fall into two categories: maintenance of voter rolls and mail ballot laws. The two voter roll lawsuits allege that the state has insufficiently maintained the rolls, with one claiming“impossibly high” voter registration ratesin five counties and the other on the allegedinclusion of noncitizensin voter rolls. Noncitizens are barred from voting in the U.S. The first suit wasdismissedin June (though an amended complaint was filed, with no updates since August), while the second has not yet been decided. However, there were indications in both lawsuits that the problem could not be addressed before November. Federal law prohibits counties from conducting routine voter roll maintenance 90 days before an election. The first suit was filed in federal court less than 90 days before the June primaries (so no immediate resolution was possible, as is required) and the discovery process for the suit would have taken months, likely stretching beyond November — a point that a GOP lawyer acknowledged in a June hearing. “We understood, of course, when we filed the lawsuit that a lot of this, especially in discovery, could take some time and perhaps, run past a November election,” Conor Woodfin, the GOP’s lawyer, said at the hearing. In addition, the noncitizen voter roll lawsuit was filed 54 days before Election Day, meaning the allegation could not be resolved because voter rolls can not be systematically altered 90 days before the election. “It really clearly would not be permissible under [federal law],” Berwick said. “That's one reason the suit is just frivolous.” The two other lawsuits alleged that the state is violating federal law by counting ballots thatarrive after Election Dayand that the state is countingnon-postmarkedmail ballots, though the GOP provided minimal evidence to support this allegation. The suits weredismissedordenied, in part because the judges ruled the Republicans had failed to establish standing, meaning they did not have the right to file the suit. Both are being appealed. Those suits are part of a nationwide legal effort regarding mail voting laws, even as national Republicansencouragevoting by mail. As of mid-September, the GOP has lost 20 of 25 mail ballot lawsuits, according toDemocracy Docket. Lawyers At a “Protect the Vote” event in Reno last month, McDonald said the GOP is planning to have more than 100 attorneys deployed across the state on Election Day. Republicans have full-time election integrity staff and counsel in Nevada, who will be joined by volunteer attorneys on Election Day, said Claire Fortenberry Zunk, an RNC spokeswoman. Staff and volunteer attorneys will be stationed at a rapid response hotline center, and some attorneys will be going to different election locations throughout the day. In addition, the GOP will have attorneys stationed at mail ballot tabulation centers in Clark and Washoe counties, which is something both parties have done. “You have not seen this before in this state,” McDonald said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-assembly-district-37-candidates-shea-backus-and-david-brog,True,"The race for Assembly District 37 in Summerlin is all but guaranteed to be close again this year — but the stakes are even higher. Two years ago, Assemblywoman Shea Backus (D-Las Vegas) won the race by about 800 votes, the third-smallest margin among the state Assembly contests. It marked a return to the Legislature for Backus, an attorney who is an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation, after first taking office in 2018 and being unseated in 2020. But this year’s race could have statewide significance, as it is among a handful of seats that may determine whether Democrats maintain their two-thirds supermajority in the lower chamber — which would allow them to override any veto from Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, as long as they also hold two-thirds of the state Senate seats. This time around, Backus, 49, is squaring off against David Brog, a 58-year-old attorney and former executive director of Christians United for Israel and a candidate for Nevada’s 1st Congressional District in 2022, when he finished second in the GOP primary. All cycle, Backus and Brog have been locked in a tight fundraising battle. In an interview, Brog described himself as a “pragmatic centrist” who is “wary of the ideological extremes of both parties.” He touted his work for former Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, who was a Republican for most of his tenure before switching to the Democratic Party, and emphasized that he is not a “bomb thrower.” Meanwhile, Backus touted her record in the 2023 legislative session, during which she served as the vice chair of the influential Assembly Ways and Means Committee. If elected, she said she wants to dive deeper into the implications of a slew of bills passed last year, particularly the record-breaking funding for K-12 education, to inform future policy. See below for a closer look at both candidates’ policy positions. Education Criminal justice Health care Elections Housing Gun control Environment Tax credits Vetoes Gaming Education The candidates have differing views on two education policies likely to resurface during next year’s legislative session: universal school meals and school choice. Backus isproposing legislationto provide free school meals to all K-12 students, extending a pandemic-era program that provided universal free meals. Lombardovetoedthe same legislation last year, arguing that the state already ensures that any student in need can receive free school meals, while Democrats have said the bill helps families who narrowly miss the income level needed to qualify for free school meals. Meanwhile, Brog said in an interview that he believes the legislation would only ensure that students from wealthy families can also have free meals at school. “I don't think there's anyone who wants to deny lunch to a student,” Brog said. “The question is, should we allocate precious dollars to buy lunches for students who don't need the help … My answer is no.” Instead, Brog wants to see more money allocated to Opportunity Scholarships, a program championed by Lombardo and opposed by Democrats that helps subsidize the cost of attending private schools in Nevada for certain low- and middle-income students. Brog thinks the state is failing to provide equal educational opportunities to all students, and that students who live in certain ZIP codes are going to receive a worse education — something that he believes Opportunity Scholarships can alleviate. Backus strongly disagrees. She referred to the scholarships as “opportunity vouchers,” and said the program lacks transparency. However, she signaled she was open to maintaining funding for students who are already enrolled in the program. Criminal justice Brog said one of the main reasons he is running is to “undo the damage” of abipartisan criminal justice reform packagethat passed in 2019. Last year, Lombardofailedin his effort to repeal key parts of the legislation, which sought to curb a ballooning prison population in the state by reducing some criminal penalties and bolstering programs that divert people from prison. Brog said the bill “led to an increase in property crime.”StatewideandClark Countydata show property crime rates have remained relatively stable in the years since the legislation passed, with some increases in 2022 and 2023. To address prison overcrowding, Brog said he would be open to exploring whether nonviolent offenders could be released early and also argued better high school graduation rates could subvert the pipeline to prisons. In response to Brog’s opposition to the 2019 legislation (which Backus supported), she said “I wonder if he is talking to the Koch brothers,” a reference to the fact that an organization tied to the billionaire conservative duosupportedthe legislation. Backus fiercely defended the legislation. “Absent changes that went into effect following the enactment of the bipartisan supported criminal justice reform bill, prison populations would have grown far worse than they are today,” she said. To further reduce prison populations, she said she wants to pursue legislation that addresses root causes of crime, such as addiction and homelessness. She touted the bipartisan passage last year ofAB528, a bill that established a wide-ranging homelessness prevention fund to build out supportive services in Southern Nevada. Health care Backus touted the Legislature’s efforts to open a medical school at UNLV and increase the school’s capacity, but said there are not enough residency programs in the state to attract doctors. She also wants to look into whether Medicaid reimbursement rates for physicians are sufficient. She commended the Legislature’s 2021 “public option”lawrequiring insurers who contract with Nevada Medicaid offer a discounted insurance plan on the state’s health insurance marketplace, although she was not in the Legislature when it passed. Brog also said his focus would be on looking into increasing the number of doctors in the state and increasing reimbursement rates. Elections Brog is supporting a Nevada ballot question to require voter ID, while Backus is opposed. Brog said it is a “basic, minimal step” to restore confidence in the state’s election systems, though he raised the question of whether people's distrust in elections were justified. Backus said it is an unnecessary measure given that ID is required to register to vote in the state. The candidates also have different views on so-called “ballot harvesting,” the process that Nevada legislators legalized permanently in 2021 that permits voters to collect and submit ballots on behalf of other people. Former President Donald Trump and his alliesfalsely claimedin 2020 that this practice led to massive voter fraud, but Republicans have since moderated their positions because of its legality. Backus said she had trust in these ballot collection policies — though she stressed that people should only give their ballots to people they trust — while Brog said he is opposed to “ballot harvesting.” If it remains legal, he wants people collecting ballots to have to register with county officials and document any ballots collected. Housing The policy of freeing up federally owned land for affordable housing development has bipartisan support in Nevada. Brog called the proposal “common sense,” and said if the land is freed up, the process of developing housing must be streamlined. “The federal government has a stranglehold on our supply of land, and therefore they have a stranglehold on our pipeline of the supply of housing,” Brog said. Although she is concerned about how expanding the footprint of the Las Vegas Valley could affect natural resources, Backus said that there are lands that should be acquired and that acquisition costs must be reasonable to ensure affordable housing can be developed there. Gun control Lombardovetoed gun control billslast year that would have raised the legal age to purchase certain firearms to 21, criminalized bringing a gun within 100 feet of an election site and placed restrictions on gun ownership for people convicted of a hate crime. Backus supported the first two bills and was excused from the vote on the third bill, though she said she would have supported it. She also said she “would seriously consider” a proposal to ban assault weapons in the state. Brog said he supported all three of Lombardo’s vetoes. Environment Among the priorities of former Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, was achieving net-zero carbon emissions in Nevada by 2050. Shortly after taking office, Lombardo’s administration took the plan offline and released anew versionlast month that essentially gives no strategy to reduce carbon emissions. The state is on track to reduce carbon emissions by about 48 percent by 2050. Backus, a supporter of Sisolak’s proposal, condemned the new plan to reduce carbon emissions, saying “it’s just a paragraph.” Brog called Sisolak’s 2050 deadline “arbitrary” — echoing a claim by Lombardo administration officials that a hard deadline for net-zero carbon emissions is ineffective — and said it could prompt a spike in electric bills. Tax credits Backus supported the Legislature’s tax credits to help fund the construction of the A’s stadium in Las Vegas — a vote that she defends today — but she would have liked to see a similar arrangement to the construction of Allegiant Stadium, whose public financing came from hotel room taxes from the Las Vegas Strip. Brog also said he would have supported the A’s tax credits, provided that the stadium brings in more tax revenue than the cost of the credits, and he thinks there is a “high burden” that must be met before approving tax credits to corporations. In the future, Backus said she would like to see greater legislative oversight of tax credits, particularly in rural areas that typically do not see as much benefit from such arrangements. Vetoes Brog said maintaining Lombardo’s veto power is the main reason he decided to run. “The vetoes are very important in providing balance and making sure we are being governed from the center and not from an ideological extreme,” Brog said. Backus supported all but one of the 75 bills that Lombardo vetoed and said she was particularly frustrated with Lombardo’s veto of AB250, which would have seen Nevada adopt prescription drug price caps adopted by Medicare. Gaming For a second straight session, legislators will vote on a proposedconstitutional amendmentto remove the state’s ban on lotteries. An affirmative vote in 2025 would allow lotteries. Brog is opposed to permitting state lotteries, while Backus (who supported the legislation last year) said she has more skepticism this time around. She’s worried the lottery won’t generate as much revenue as it does in other states, and that the regulation of the lottery could cost more than any revenue that is brought in.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/four-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-speech-in-las-vegas,True,"With an ultra-competitive presidential election cycle nearing its home stretch, Vice President Kamala Harris continued her barnstorming of battleground states in Las Vegas on Sunday, rallying thousands of attendees on her economic and immigration policies and urging them to make a plan to vote and help take her “underdog” candidacy over the top. In remarks lasting about 25 minutes, Harris did not announce any new policies but sought to generate support for her plans to lower the cost of living and address illegal border crossings, pitching herself as the only candidate in the race with proposals that will benefit Americans. The economy and immigration are consistently among the top issues among voters nationwide, and Harris has recently made up ground as being more trusted to address the issues, though lasting inflation in the wake of the pandemic has often harmed Democratic messaging on the economy. The event was at the World Market Center in downtown Las Vegas — the same venue where former President Donald Trumpralliedmore than 6,000 supporters two weeks ago. Harris’ campaign opened up much more space for Sunday’s rally, and more than 7,500 people attended, the campaign said. It marked Harris’ second stop in Las Vegas since President Joe Biden scrapped his re-election bid in July. Sheheld a rallyat the Thomas & Mack Center last month in front of more than 12,000 people, one of the largest Nevada rallies in modern political history. Harris also visited Nevada six times earlier this year, stumping for President Biden. Nevada is squarely among the battleground states that could determine the winner of the presidential election, of which Harris has repeatedly described herself as the underdog. Pollsconsistently showa dead heat between Harris and Trump to secure the state’s six electoral votes — a reality that left some rally attendees dumbfounded. “I am utterly flummoxed every morning when I wake up and I see polls where it's a horse race,” said Jay Cloetens, a 55-year-old printer technician. “Is this parody or is this real? It's so crazy, and yet it could go either way.” Here areThe Indy’smain takeaways from Sunday’s rally. It’s the economy, stupid Harris spent much of her speech outlining her already-announced plans to bolster the economy. She touted proposals to provide $50,000 in tax breaks for people starting small businesses, increase the federal child tax credit from $2,000 to $6,000 for newborns and loosen college degree requirements for federal jobs. The economy is top of mind for voters nationwide, but particularly in Las Vegas — a city dominated by the hospitality industry that was pummelled by the pandemic. Nevada’s job growth rate since the pandemic ranks first nationwide but the state’s unemployment rate is also near the top, while inflation (which is easing) has continued to outpace wage growth, according todatapresented by state economists in June. As child care costs have risen faster than wages,recent pollingfrom the University of Maryland indicates more than 73 percent of Nevadans support raising the child tax credit to $3,600 and making it fully refundable (paid out even when a family doesn’t owe taxes), in line with pandemic-era child tax credits that expired in 2022. Sin City is also the home of a rare source of agreement among both candidates: a proposal to end taxes on tipped wages, which Trump first proposed in June and Harris later backed in August. Though Harris did not mention the policy at Sunday’s rally, Jasmin Newsom, a 19-year-old student at the College of Southern Nevada who attended the event, said she supported the policy — but found it irrelevant that Trump was first to propose it. “I don't feel like that means much though to us. She just cares about families in general,” Newsom said. “She didn't grow up in a higher class like Donald Trump did, so she sees us lower class people more.” Helen Coombs, a 68-year-old retiree who recently enrolled in Medicare along with her diabetic husband, said the Biden administration’s passage of the Inflation Reduction Act — which capped monthly insulin prices at $35 for Medicare recipients — was a lifeline for her family. More housing — but what about on federally owned land? Last month, Harrisunveiled her planto combat the nation’s affordable housing crisis — which she rehashed Sunday. She championed her plan to build 3 million new housing units nationwide and provide $25,000 in down payment assistance for eligible first-time homebuyers. “We must lower the cost of living because, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high,” Harris said. However, absent from Harris’ remarks Sunday and her general housing plan is the topic of freeing up federally owned land for housing development. In Nevada, the federal governmentowns about 86 percentof the land, limiting its development and use, and the opening up of such lands has received bipartisan support from the state’s Republican governor, Joe Lombardo, and Democratic members of Congress. In Las Vegas earlier this month, Trump vowed to free up federally owned land, stating that those areas would have “ultra low regulations” — a topic absent in Nevada lands bills stalled in Congress — and linked the opening of the lands to a pledge to grow the state’s film industry, though that policy is likely to be addressed on the state level,as has been proposed through tax credits. Conservationistshave arguedthat any lands bill should sufficiently protect the environment, and some critics of releasing federal lands for development have called for less urban sprawl and more upward development. The development of more land also requires potentially costly infrastructure and could strain or hinder public services in the case of wildfires or other natural disasters. The immigration emphasis Two days aftervisiting a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona and adopting a stricter immigration policy, Harris largely stuck to her typical campaign rhetoric on immigration. Harris’ new plan would go further than the Biden administration’s crackdown of illegal border crossings, increasing criminal charges for repeat offenders and requiring claims for asylum to be made at ports of entry. She was a proponent of much leaner immigration enforcement policies — such as decriminalizing illegal border crossings — before becoming vice president, butpolls have shownvoters trust Trump more than her on immigration. If elected, Trump has vowed to conduct the largest mass deportation operation in American history. At Sunday’s rally, Harris repeated policies meant to placate multiple wings of the Democratic Party, calling for a pathway to citizenship for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children, while also attacking Trump fortorpedoing bipartisan legislationthat would have given the Biden administration the authority to “close” the border — or cease processing most asylum claims — if the number of migrant encounters reaches a certain threshold. Rally attendee Michelle Waters, 61, was particularly outspoken about Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, which has ramped up in recent weeks, punctuated by him echoing thebaselessclaim that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating people’s pets. “We're all immigrants, right? We all came from somewhere,” Waters said. “His wife is an immigrant. The whole United States is made up of immigrants.” Appealing to Latinos Harris called out Latinos specifically, saying that “Latina small-business owners are the fastest growing segment of our economy” and promising to tap into their “ambitious aspirations” and dreams through a $50,000 tax deduction for those starting new businesses. It signified the campaign’s approach to winning over Latino voters, a crucial and growing voting bloc in Nevada. The Harris campaign's appeals have featured ads targeting Spanish- and English-speaking Latino voters in swing states, including Nevada. The policy and community-focused adstouch on topicsincludingpublic safety, the economy,immigration and health care without explicitly describing Latinos as a vital voting bloc. ATelemundopollreleased Sunday found Harris with a 14 percentage point lead among Latinos nationwide, a significant erosion in support from four years ago. Asurveyfrom UnidosUS found Harris with a 23 percent lead over Trump among Nevada Latinos, though that is still lower than Biden’s winning margin in 2020. Noe Quintero, the son of Mexican immigrants and a Clark County fire captain, introduced Harris. Speaking at times in Spanish, he shared a story about himself as a father, husband and middle-class worker, highlighting his hopes for reproductive freedom and better health care for his daughter, who has a genetic disorder that affects her brain and development. He made an economic case for supporting Harris. “I want my children to live in a country [where] you don't have to work multiple jobs to put food on the table,” Quintero said. “Vice President Harris is putting everyday, middle-class, working families first — families like mine, families like yours. She's going to fight to cut costs and create union jobs that my community depends on.” Reporter Tabitha Mueller contributed to this article.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/berkley-views-las-vegas-mayors-race-as-her-final-chapter-in-public-service,True,"Longtime friends of Shelley Berkley were surprised when the former congresswoman — more than a decade removed from holding elected office after losing a close race for the U.S. Senate — decided to run for Las Vegas mayor. Mayor Carolyn Goodman was term-limited and the Goodman family’s quarter-century hold on the mayor’s office — which began in 1999 with the election of mob lawyer Oscar Goodman — is ending. Two current Las Vegas City Council members tossed their names into the race and there were 15 candidates by the close of filing. Initially, former Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones Blackhurst thought her longtime friend “had honestly lost her mind.” But Blackhurst said that notion was fleeting when she considered the knowledge and experience Berkley, 73, would bring to the office. “Her heart is in public service,” said Blackhurst, who became the first woman to serve as mayor when she held the office for two terms from 1991 to 1999. “I think Shelley wanted one more public service role. When you looked at what's out there, this is the one position where she could have the most impact.” Berkley spent 14 years — seven two-year terms — representing much of Southern Nevada in Congress. Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District was added in 2003, and much of the area Berkley represented was confined to Las Vegas. Tod Story, who served as Berkley’s district director in Las Vegas for all of her 14 years in Congress, wasn’t surprised when she announced her candidacy for mayor in January 2023. “She will outwork anyone and she will run circles around anyone running against her,” Story said. Berkley was born in New York City but moved to Las Vegas with her family in the 1960s when she was in junior high school. She graduated in 1972 from UNLV, where she served as student body president, and then graduated from the University of San Diego School of Law in 1976. In Congress, Berkley’s record included a favorable vote to pass the Affordable Care Act of 2010 — often referred to as Obamacare — and her support in 2009 for a clean-energy bill that passed in the House but never made it out of the Senate. In 2002, Berkley was one of 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the U.S. invasion of Iraq. InThe Indy’sfirst mayor’s forumin May, Berkley said she regretted the vote. During her time in Congress, many states began exploring casino expansion. Fellow representatives — Democrats and Republicans — turned to Berkley, who had spent a few years as the vice president of government and legal affairs for Las Vegas Sands Corp., for advice. “Shelley was the go-to person on gaming,” said former Sen. Richard Bryan (D-NV), whose two terms overlapped with Berkley. Blackhurst and Bryan support fellow Democrat Berkley, who is running against Las Vegas Councilwoman Victoria Seaman, the second-place finisher in the June primary election who trailed Berkley by roughly 5,000 votes. “I believe Shelley is the right person for the job right now,” Blackhurst said. “It’s not just the job of running the city. We need someone in local government who is the thought leader and is speaking to larger issues that impact the valley.” In an interview withThe Nevada Independent, Berkley said she’s running for mayor because of her commitment to public service and her family’s history of coming to America from Russia to escape the Holocaust in the early 1940s. She repeated that statement throughout the campaign and duringlast week’s mayoral forumpresented byThe Nevada Independentat the Fontainebleau Las Vegas. “Public service has always been my way of giving back,” said Berkley, who also served a two-year term in the Nevada Assembly and two terms as an elected higher education regent. “My grandparents could have never imagined when they were on that boat and passing the Statue of Liberty at Ellis Island that I would be living the life that I'm living. It was unfathomable, I'm sure.” After retiring in 2023 following nearly nine years of holding leadership roles in the Touro University System and with Touro University Western Division, a private medical school in Henderson, she thought about other ideas to remain involved in the community. She said it took a few months to consider running for mayor. “I didn’t wake up one day and think I should be mayor,” she said. Berkley consulted her family and friends, all of whom she said were supportive, including her adult sons, Max and Sam, and her husband, physician Larry Lehrner, a kidney specialist. “I was pregnant with Max when I ran for the Assembly. Sam was born into this,” Berkley said. The idea of “performing public service in my hometown as mayor was a remarkable opportunity. Once I made the decision, it just felt right, and everything fell into place.” A partisan race Berkley’s closest campaign for Congress was her first election in 1998 when she won by fewer than 6,000 votes over Republican Don Chairez. Berkley had 49.2 percent of the vote in the field of four that included Libertarian and Independent American Party candidates. Two years later, Berkley defeated Republican Jon Porter by more than 17,000 votes, earning a majority of 51.7 percent of votes cast in another four-person race. In her next five elections, she collected between a low of 53.7 percent in 2002 to a high of 67.6 percent in 2008. Berkley’s political career seemed to end in 2012 when she narrowly lost a race for the U.S. Senate against then-Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV). Her campaign was marred by a House ethics investigation into charges she used her office to benefit her husband’s medical practice. An investigative panel for the House Ethics Committee said from April 2008 through December 2010, Berkley’s husband contacted her congressional office to complain about problems his medical practice, Kidney Specialists of Southern Nevada, had in collecting payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs, Medicare or Medicaid. National Republicans and GOP-aligned groups spent millions of dollars questioning Berkley’s character. Heller won the race by a little more than 12,000 votes, or 1.3 percent. The race drew more than 1 million Nevada voters. After the election, the House Ethics Committeeended the caseby adopting the findings of its investigative panel, ruling that although she violated House rules by “running afoul of standards of conduct,” no discipline was necessary because of Berkley’s cooperation. The conclusions also said the Nevada Democrat did not attempt to enrich herself. The committee said her activities “appear to have been motivated by factors wholly divorced from her family’s financial well-being.” Berkley said at the time the findings “put to rest any claims that I acted improperly in fighting for (my constituents’) health care needs.” In the aftermath of the race, Berkleyreleased a statementwishing Heller well, adding, “He’s got an enormous task ahead of him.” Heller could not be reached for comment. Following 2019 legislationthat required eight Nevada cities to move municipal elections from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years starting in 2022, this campaign marks the first time the nonpartisan mayor’s race is on the ballot with partisan contests, such as those for president and the U.S. Senate. With Seaman having served two years in the Assembly as a Republican lawmaker, and Berkley’s long-standing ties to the Democratic Party, the campaign has taken on a partisan demeanor. UNLV history professor Michael Green, who closely follows local politics, said party polarization has been a part of municipal elections since the transition to even-numbered years helped change the nature of the races. “Oran Gragson served four terms as mayor and I don’t think anyone realized he was a Republican,” Green said, noting that Blackhurst twice ran for governor as a Democrat while she was mayor. “It was a lot less polarized back then.” Steven Slivka, who spent six years working with Berkley at Touro overseeing communications for the school, said she always stressed the importance of bipartisanship when it came to the school’s relationship with the community and the state. During legislative sessions, Slivka said Berkley would escort Touro students, faculty and staff to Carson City to meet with state lawmakers from both parties. He added that Berkley worked with governors from both parties to help ensure Nevada’s budget included funds for more residencies, “which meant more physicians for our growing population.” Berkley said she is conducting her campaign in a bipartisan effort, reaching out to Democrats and Republicans within the city limits. She said she knows she needs votes from members of both parties as well as nonpartisans and criticized Seaman for making the campaign more Democrat vs. Republican. According to the most recent voter registration numbers from the Clark County Election Department, the city of Las Vegas has about 132,000 registered Democrats, about 101,000 Republicans and about 136,000 registered nonpartisans. “The more partisan she is, the more that plays to my advantage,” Berkley said. “When a constituent wants a pothole fixed, they don’t care if the mayor is a Democrat or a Republican, they just want their damn pothole fixed, and I’m good at that.” Berkley cited her efforts in 2006 to secure more than $400 million in federal funding for Southern Nevada’s first Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which was built in North Las Vegas. At the time, Republicans were in control of the White House, Congress and Veterans Affairs. “I was able to sit down and convince them that we were in desperate need of a hospital for the 200,000 veterans living in Southern Nevada,” Berkley said. “That’s how I operate.” A downtown medical center One priority that Berkley said she would like to accomplish as mayor is settling thelong-running land-use disputesurrounding the defunct Badlands golf course that could cost taxpayers upward of $450 million to $650 million. That’s one issue whereshe and Seaman agree. However, they disagree about how to accomplish that. Other goals include converting the site of the now-closed Grant Sawyer State Office Building into a downtown medical complex with an anchor hospital. “I think that would be a game changer for that area, so that would be my preference,” Berkley said. “But if a better suggestion comes along, I'm certainly open to it.” She said she would also look forward to working with “an exciting group of young downtown developers” who have ideas to boost the efforts that took place during the past few years to improve the downtown area for tourists and locals. “They are changing what Las Vegas looks like,” Berkley said. “If you walk around Main Street, there are really good restaurants and some really good shopping. It's just a fun place to be and I will continue to be supportive.” Earlier this month, Elaine Wynnsaid she wanted to createa Las Vegas Museum of Art on 1.5 acres in the city’s downtown cultural district. The museum, a partnership with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is expected to cost $150 million and open in 2028. “Creating a serious art hub that will draw people that are on the Strip is an extraordinary idea,” Berkley said. “I want to promote that and do everything I can to encourage it.” ‘Las Vegas is a different city’ According todata from AdImpact, Berkley has reserved $445,000 in television advertising for her election. Seaman has yet to book any television advertising. Berkley said she has the endorsements of council members Brian Knudsen, Olivia Díaz and Nancy Brune. According to the campaign contribution and expense reports, as of June 30, Berkley has raised nearly $518,000 while Seaman raised about $412,000. Berkley’s campaign is being managed by longtime Las Vegas advertising executive Tom Letizia, who handled the campaigns for both Goodmans. Las Vegas City Councilman Cedric Crear, who finished third in the primary with almost 19 percent, has not endorsed either Berkley or Seaman. Council member Francis Allen-Palenske has not made an endorsement, and neither has either Goodman. “What the Goodmans have done well in the city I hope to maintain and build upon it,” Berkley said. “Las Vegas is a different city than it was 25 years ago when Oscar took control. It would probably be different when my term ends.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-assembly-district-29-candidates-annette-dawson-owens-and-joe-dalia,True,"With Democrats seeking to maintain their two-thirds majority in the Assembly, and just one seat shy of a supermajority in the Senate, swingy Assembly District 29 could prove key to whether the party can achieve enough power to neutralize the Republican governor’s veto power and accomplish their legislative agenda next session. The long-competitive, slightlyDemocratic-leaning district cuts across large swaths of Henderson, with some 33 percent of voters registered as Democrats, 32.5 percent registered as nonpartisan and 26 percent as Republican. With five-term Democratic Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen's upcoming departure, Democrat Joe Dalia and Republican Annette Dawson Owens are vying for the newly open seat. Dawson Owens, 57, who has beenendorsed by Lombardo, has worked as an educator in Nevada for decades and served as the school readiness policy director for the nonprofit Children’s Advocacy Alliance. Her time in education, she said, was one of the main reasons she decided to run for office for the first time. Dalia’ is no stranger to politics. The 33-year-old Michigan Law School alum ran for the seat last cycle but lost handily to Cohen in the primary. He also previously interned with Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader, and has worked as a privacy attorney for numerous Silicon Valley companies, including his current employer, Facebook parent company Meta. Dalia is a native Nevadan. Take a look below for more on their policy positions. Education School choice Health care Reproductive rights Elections Vetoes Housing Education Dawson Owens and Dalia said that Nevada’s education system was their main motivation for running. If she could wave a magic wand, Dawson Owens said that she’d increase investments into early childhood education such as kindergarten readiness programs, which have been shown to have lifelong benefits. Dalia says that his top priorities are increasing funding (Nevada’s per-pupil funding is consistently among the lowest in the nation) and increasing teacher recruitment and retention. Dalia also said he is in favor of free lunches for all students regardless of their household income, a topic that has become mired in controversy after Republican Gov. Joe Lombardovetoeda bill last session that would have continued Nevada’s pandemic-era universal free lunch program, saying that a large number of students were already eligible for free meals. School choice Dawson Owens said that she supports providing state funding for school choice options. Such programs, like Nevada’s own Opportunity Scholarships, subsidize the cost of attending private schools for eligible low- and middle-income students. Opportunity Scholarships, which have limited enrollment and strict income eligibility requirements, have been a lightning rod issue since their creation in 2015 and are likely to come up again during the next legislative session. Dawson Owens said that she believes that parents should have the right to be able to select a school for their child and that taxpayer money should “follow the student,” regardless of whether they attend a public, private or charter school. Dalia, like other Democrats, said he opposes such school choice policies. He expressed concerns that school choice policies will further divert attention from helping Nevada’s struggling public schools. Health care Dawson Owens and Dalia agreed that Nevada’s health care system needs to be revamped and that the state needs more providers. The Republican candidate said she believes that the state needs to invest into educational opportunities and build more hospitals to draw additional medical professionals to the state. Dawson Owens says that she believes a large part of Nevada’s health care issues comes from a lack of adequate investment. Another one of Dawson Owens’ top concerns is the lack of mental health providers. She said she is troubled by the fact that Nevadacurrently ranks as the worst state for mental health, according to one recent analysis. Dalia has similar concerns. He believes that putting more money toward Nevada’s medical training programs can help boost provider retention, and he wants to look at “cumbersome” insurance practices, such as heavily relying on prior authorizations, that he says can harm patients and doctors’ offices. Dalia also supports adopting prescription drug price caps negotiated by Medicare under the Inflation Reduction Act. Reproductive rights Dawson Owens said that she supports access to abortion services in certain instances. Although the Republican candidate didn’t offer a clear yes or no about whether the state should expand existing abortion protections, she said she understands when “health” or “the situation” call for an abortion. Dalia said that protecting abortion access is an “easy yes.” He also said that he agreed witha recent Nevada Supreme Court rulingthat ordered the state Medicaid program to cover abortions. Elections If passed,Ballot Question 7would require Nevadans to bring an ID when voting, joining 24 other states that have similar requirements. Dalia said that such voter ID requirements are part of wider political efforts across the country to disenfranchise voters, particularly those from marginalized communities, When asked about the ballot question, Dawson Owens said that she believes “secure” elections are the biggest priority. “We want people to have trust in the election system,” she said. Neither candidate believes that widespread voter fraud happened during the 2020 election, and neither raised concerns about“ballot harvesting,” a practice now legalized in Nevada involving people collecting and submitting ballots on behalf of others. Vetoes Last year, Lombardo issued a record 75 vetoes, and Dawson Owens said that she will do her best if elected to protect his power to veto. Dawson Owens has been a longtime supporter of Lombardo, and says that she met with the governor’s team prior to joining the race this year, vowing to “always” support him. For Dalia, Lombardo’s vetoes rang a bit of an alarm bell, especially given that he considered many of the rejected bills — such as the one allowing terminally ill patients to self-administer a life-ending drug — to be of quality. Dalia says that vetoes should only be used for special circumstances. Housing Dawson Owens said that freeing up federally owned land — a proposal with bipartisan support that includes the governor — could help create more affordable housing. But for Dalia, the “devil’s in the details.” Although he broadly agrees that more federal land should be released for development, he has concerns about conservation efforts and would want to ensure that Nevada’s tribal reservations would remain unaffected. Dalia also says he’s open to proposals removing the state’s summary eviction process so that the landlord would file first, and wants to find ways to make the process more fair to tenants.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/vegas-mayor-candidates-agree-on-ending-badlands-drama-but-spar-on-how,True,"Las Vegas mayoral candidates Shelley Berkley and Victoria Seaman agreed the city needs to settle thelong-running land-use disputesurrounding the defunct Badlands golf course that could cost taxpayers upward of $450 million to $650 million. But they disagreed sharply about how during a 90-minute forum Wednesday at Fontainebleau Las Vegas, sponsored byThe Nevada Independentand televised live byKSNV-TV Channel 3,that also touched on public safety, homelessness and affordable housing. Over the next six weeks, voters will weigh in on who should lead Nevada’s largest city, which has been under the leadership of Oscar Goodman or his wife Carolyn for the last 25 years. Berkley, a former 14-year member of Congress, and Seaman, who has spent five years on the city council, both said resolving the Badlands matter would be the first order of business if they were victorious in the Nov. 5 election. The city has been embroiled in a fight with developers who planned to turn the golf course at Alta Drive off Rampart Boulevard into a housing development, and it was the most contentious discussion point of the forum. “I also think a change of leadership at the top will go a long way into moving the city council in the direction of yes,” Berkley told moderator Jon Ralston,The Indy’sCEO and editor. “Even before I get sworn in, I'm going to sit down with my fellow council members and ask how we can get to yes.” Seaman said she voted to end the Badlands litigation every time the matter was brought before the city council, but she was in the minority because city staff and city attorneys wanted to continue the legal fight. The city lost an appeal in a unanimous Nevada Supreme Court decision in Augustand paid offa $64 million judgment. “I ran on settling Badlands. I did everything that I could to let city staff know that if we didn’t settle it would be at the cost of taxpayers,” Seaman said. “You have to have a council that is willing to take a stand and go against staff.” Berkley said that Seaman, despite campaign promises, hasn't delivered a vote by the city council. “That’s not leadership,” Berkley said. “That is taking a stand and being well opposed, but not leading.” Berkley topped a field of 15 candidates in the June primary, earning almost 35.7 percent of the votes. Seaman was the runner-up with 28.9 percent of the vote. Las Vegas City Councilman Cedric Crear finished third with almost 19 percent. Crear has not endorsed either Berkley or Seaman. Berkley said in an interview she has the endorsements of council members Brian Knudsen, Olivia Díaz and Nancy Brune. Council member Francis Allen-Palenske has not made an endorsement, and neither has Mayor Carolyn Goodman. Experienced candidates Following 2019 legislationthat required eight Nevada cities to move municipal elections from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years starting in 2022, this campaign marks the first time the nonpartisan mayor’s race is on the ballot with partisan contests, such as for president and the U.S. Senate. Berkley’s candidacy marked her return to the political stage a dozen years after she lost a high-profile race for the U.S. Senate, which ended her seven terms in Congress as a Democrat. ​After leaving Washington, D.C., Berkley came home to Southern Nevada and held leadership roles for nearly nine years in the Touro University System and with Touro University Western Division, a private medical school in Henderson. Berkley previously served one term in the Assembly and two terms as an elected higher education regent. Seaman has been on the city council since 2019 representing Ward 2, which covers southwestern Las Vegas. She previously served one term in the assembly as a Republican. Before running for elected office, Seaman, who holds real estate and business broker licenses in Nevada, created and owned day spas, which have since been sold. This year’s mayoral race is the first time in 25 yearsa member of the Goodman familyis not on the ballot. Oscar Goodman served as the city’s mayor from 1999 to 2011; his wife Carolyn was elected that year and has served as mayor ever since. She is term-limited and couldn’t run. Both candidates praised the Goodmans. “They changed downtown,” said Seaman, who only served with Carolyn Goodman. “We've done a lot for education. We've done … a lot for homelessness. I think that she brought a lot to the city.” Berkley said the Goodmans helped propel Las Vegas into the 21st century. “It was a family endeavor, for them,” Berkley said. “ They're leaving Las Vegas in very good shape for whoever becomes the next mayor.” Click below to see how the candidates addressed the following topics: Why you’re running Leading the council Public safety Affordable housing Homelessness and mental health Improving medical services Why you're running Berkley, who retired from her position with Touro in 2022, said serving as mayor would be an opportunity to continue her long career in public service. “Being able to be mayor of your hometown is nothing short of extraordinary,” Berkley said. “Four generations of my family have now called Las Vegas home.” Berkley said her vision for the city is not just looking to tomorrow or next year, but “what I want this city to look like for my grandchildren when they are my age.” Seaman said she’s treated her city council position as a full-time job and has taken a leadership role on various issues. “I spent time trying to understand everything about the city,” Seaman said. “What I love the most about the job is that you get close to the people. You don't have caucuses [like in the Legislature]. You can get things done. I believe we need someone who has some institutional knowledge of city government to continue moving forward.” Leading the council forward Costs associated with the Badlands court fight have prompted the city not to fill certain vacant job positions. That’s one reason both candidates want the matter settled. Berkley said her experiences in the private sector would help her guide the council over the next four years “You are the representative [of Las Vegas] to the outside world because it's a world-class destination,” she said. “I think my background and who I am and how I conduct myself makes me best able to represent this community.” Seaman said her motivation to run is to make Las Vegas the most economically diversified city in the country. She wants to help lead the city’s efforts with philanthropist Elaine Wynn to bring an art museum to the downtown area and she would like to see the city create additional charter schools. “When I moved here 20 years ago, we didn't even have a sports team. Now, we have so much more to offer,” Seaman said. “There's so much more that we can do moving forward.” Public safety Both candidates expressed their commitment to working closely with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and Sheriff Kevin McMahill. Seaman touted her endorsements by organizations associated with the different law enforcement agencies in the state. She also defended her comments that crime is on the rise in Southern Nevada even when shown news reports of declining numbers for burglaries and nonviolent crimes. In an interview with theLas Vegas Review-Journalearlier this month, McMahill said homicides were trending down about 18 percent this year and robberies are down about 20 percent. Ralston asked Seaman why she was painting “this kind of dystopian picture” of Las Vegas. “I want to make sure we're a safer city, Seaman replied. “We bring in 42 million tourists a year. I will take bold action to combat crime and restore safety to our city.” Berkley said her responsibility as mayor is to ensure Metro has the proper financial resources, manpower and technology to keep the community safe. She noted both Clark County and the city fund Metro’s budget. She said she wasn’t concerned about the endorsements. “I have worked well with the police and I’ve had their endorsements in the past,” Berkley said. “[If] I'm lucky enough to become mayor, I think all of the police organizations know that I will have an open door and we will work together.” Affordable housing Seaman said she is committed to “ensuring that builders and developers will have the tools and incentives they need to significantly expand affordable housing opportunities within our community.” Berkley said she agreed with a recent city council ordinance that eases certain development restrictions that would allow for more affordable housing. “There isn't a magic wand that a councilwoman or a mayor can wave and automatically have hundreds of thousands of affordable houses, but we can start making a dent that I think will go a long way,” she said. Homelessness and mental health Both candidates suggested the two issues are somewhat intertwined given that proper mental health services are needed to reduce homeless encampments in the city. Seaman expressed a commitment to work with Gov. Joe Lombardo on bringing a branch of Haven for Hope, a San Antonio, Texas-based transformational homeless campus, to Las Vegas. She added the city’sCourtyard Homeless Resource Centerhas been a good starting point. “I want to continue to make sure that we have those resources for people who need to get off the ground,” Seaman said. “I work very closely with nonprofits, and I will continue to do that and to make sure that we can get as many people we can into recovery and mental health services.” Berkley said the city “is spending a fortune on homeless services and since Victoria has been a city council member, homelessness has not only increased, it's almost doubled.” She added the city “can do better” in tackling the issue. “This is a humanitarian problem,” Berkley said. Improving medical services Seaman said her goal is to bring a standalone children’s hospital to Las Vegas and began discussions with Intermountain Health on exploring some land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management in Ward 2. However, Intermountain Health is looking at a site in unincorporated Clark County. “Guess what? I'm okay with that,” Seaman said. “I believe that Southern Nevada needs a children’s hospital. I think we have great children's hospital wards here but we need our own hospital.” Berkley said she was working on a feasibility study with Intermountain Health for the hospital, which calls for the medical corporation to pay two-thirds of building costs for the hospital. “I also support the fact that they're going to build one,” she said. “This will help the people in the city of Las Vegas that have the desperate need.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-senate-district-15-candidates-angie-taylor-and-mike-ginsburg,True,"It’s no secret that Nevada’s legislative power is consolidated in populous Southern Nevada. But Northern Nevada’s Senate District 15 could be key to Democrats clinching their first two-thirds Senate supermajority this century. The district covering southwestern Washoe County, which used to favor Republicans but shifted to have a significant Democratic voter registration advantage under the state’s 2021 redistricting process, is open after Sen. Heidi Seevers O'Gara (formerly Seevers Gansert) (R-Reno)announced last yearthat she would not run for re-election. DemocratAngie Taylor, a former two-term Washoe County School Board member and one-term assemblywoman, is squaring off against Republican Mike Ginsburg, a Washoe County resident whose family is deeply rooted in the community and who has worked at NV Energy for the past 39 years. Taylor, the first Black woman to represent a Northern Nevada district in the Assembly, highlighted her experience in the Legislature, expertise in education and track record of working across the aisle with Republicans including Gov. Joe Lombardo. Growing up, Taylor said she was raised with her two older siblings by their single mother in the projects. She said she was lucky to have a mother who valued education and a community that supported her. “There are people that have mentored me, that have guided me, that have helped me,” Taylor said. “I have to do something with that.” Ginsburg notes that his family first moved to the state 110 years ago and that he has been raising his three daughters in the district. He has chaired the City of Reno Parks and Recreation Commission and served two terms on the Neighborhood Advisory Board for the City of Reno’s Ward 1. Ginsburg said he wants to address the high cost of living and ensure that the Legislature doesn’t have a Democratic supermajority in both chambers that could easily override Lombardo’s vetoes. “Everything I have done in my volunteer career has been to better this community we live in.  Running for Senate District 15 is just an extension of what I already do and have done,” he said. In separate, in-depth interviews withThe Nevada Independent, Taylor and Ginsburg shared what distinguishes them, described how they would approach legislation and answered questions across a wide range of policy areas. Clickherefor the full list of questions we asked each candidate and their edited responses. Education School choice Reproductive rights Elections Health care Housing Gun policies Tax credits Education Taylor said if she could wave a magic wand and make one change to Nevada’s education system, it would be to reduce class sizes, allowing for more individualized attention. She said the challenge with meeting that need is increasing the number of certified teachers and ensuring that schools have the space to accommodate more classes. Ginsburg said he would like to see teachers' salaries increase, better compensating them for the time and resources they put into their classrooms. Ginsburg said that school discipline “should be left to the school district without interference from the state.” Asked about school discipline changes, Taylor said she’s been addressing the issue, pointing to thebipartisan school safety measureshe passed in the 2023 legislative session alongside a complementary bill from Gov. Joe Lombardo thattightened school discipline laws, expanding the ability of schools to suspend or expel students. The legislation advanced as part of a deal topass two major budget billsat the end of the 2023 legislative session. Additionally, Taylor said it’s necessary to identify and address the root causes of behavioral issues leading to the disruption. Both candidates said they supported increasing the state’s per-pupil funding to bring it in line with the national average, though Ginsburg said his support somewhat depends on where the money is allocated and the accountability measures in place. Taylor also supports accountability measures, emphasizing that methods of evaluating schools need to focus on proficiency and learning outcomes, not just increased graduation rates. On the issue of universal free school meals, a topic that has becomea political lightning rodafter Lombardovetoeda bill last session that would have continued the pandemic-era program, both candidates’ answers aligned with the stance of their parties. Taylor said she supported free breakfasts and lunches for all students regardless of family income. Ginsburg said the program needs to be limited to lower-income households and the families that need the meals are already receiving them. He said he has fears about food waste for kids who don’t need the lunches. Food service officials havepushed back on claimsthat students from affluent families are taking lunches and then discarding them at high rates. School choice Taylor said she supports funding for school choice options that are within Nevada’s public school system, such as magnet schools, International Baccalaureate programs and career and technical education programs. Once Nevada’s public school system is fully funded, Taylor said lawmakers can discuss school choice options such as state subsidies for private schools. Ginsburg said a child’s education should not be driven by ZIP codes, and if a parent wants a child to attend a charter school, private school or another education alternative, they should be able to do so. “A parent shouldn't have to live across from a school, but have to drive their child 4 miles to another school, because it's a better school,” Ginsburg said. He said he supports state subsidies for private schooling but hasn’t decided whether the program should have caps. States such asArizonaandFloridathat help families with private school tuition and have no income limits have racked up massive costs, though Nevada’s Opportunity Scholarship program supporting private school tuition has limited enrollment and an income limit of up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Asked whether the nearly1,000 studentswho currently receive Opportunity Scholarships should continue to receive them, Taylor did not directly answer the question. She said some of the state funding that went to the program was mismanaged, but there should be enough funding to get the program through the next biennium. Reproductive rights Taylor and Ginsburg said they would support legislation protecting the legality of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in Nevada. Ginsburg, however, noted that “IVF is not at risk in Nevada, and I believe the government should not find solutions in search of a problem.” Taylor said she supports Question 6, which would enshrine abortion protections in the Nevada Constitution, and a separate, more expansive proposed constitutional amendment protecting access to a wide variety of reproductive health services, including birth control, abortion and fertility treatments, which is going before legislators in 2025. “It's really important that every woman has a right to make the medical decisions that are best for her,” Taylor said. “I think that's critically important, and that's what I'm absolutely committed to.” Ginsburg described the issue of abortion as a “hard and charged issue” and said as the father of three daughters, he’s fought to protect them since they were kids. He did not say whether he would change or expand Nevada’s existing abortion protections, but did say he would support a requirement that parents are notified of their minor child’s abortion. “The reality is in Nevada, abortion is legal up to six months, and that can’t be changed,” he said. “Abortion is the hardest decision a woman can make — we don't need to make it harder by politicizing it.” Taylor said there’s nothing that jumps out to her about the parental notification law that needs to change. Nevadadoes not requireparental notification or consent for minors to obtain an abortion. This is because a federal court struck down Nevada's parental notification law in 1985, and a 2015 bill to reinstate the law did not pass. Ginsburg said he needed more time before addressing questions about whether Nevada should fund abortion services through Medicaid or if the state should fund crisis pregnancy centers or nonprofit organizations that provide counseling and other prenatal services from an anti-abortion perspective. Elections Taylor, who serves as a caregiver for her 81-year-old mother, said she is opposed to voter ID laws because theydisenfranchiseolder Nevadans and Nevadans of color. She said her mother doesn’t drive and it would be difficult tolocate her license or get another identificationif it has expired. “I don't want anyone to vote who's not legal to vote, but we don't have a problem,” Taylor said. “Why would I take a chance on disenfranchising folks for no reason?” If theballot measure to implement voter ID lawspasses, Taylor said she will ensure her mom can vote, but worries about seniors who don’t have support. Ginsburg said he believes voter ID is necessary because it would prevent noncitizens from voting and strengthen the state’s election laws. He also cited the broad-ranging support for voterID based on polling. Asked about fears that voter ID could create barriers for voting, Ginsburg said he’d like to see reliable data showing that certain voters are disenfranchised by the practice and then would welcome a conversation. Ginsburg said he did not believe the 2020 election was stolen and “people often combine the stolen election theory with rightful criticism of our election laws.” He said he would support halting automatic voter registration and ending the practice of sending mail ballots to virtually all Nevada voters. Health care The high cost of prescription drugs is a problem, according to Taylor, who said senior citizens are choosing between paying their rent and paying for prescription drugs. She said she would support the state adopting prescription drug price caps negotiated by Medicare under the Inflation Reduction Act. In 2023, Lombardo vetoed a proposal to do that. Ginsburg did not say whether he would support or oppose Medicare-negotiated drug price caps, but he said he would be open to considering the policy as long as it did not negatively affect health care services. Both candidates emphasized the need to address the state’s health care provider shortage, including by expanding learning and training opportunities for doctors, such as residencies. Housing As a swing statewith a particularly acute housing crisis, the topic of affordable housing has permeated the election cycle. Taylor said local governments are often better equipped to address the housing crisis than the state government because the problems are localized by region. One policy that would have an immediate broad effect, she said, is restricting corporate landlords from buying up properties in the state. A landlord herself, Taylor said that policy wouldn’t target smaller landlords who own two or three homes but larger companies that are buying up significant swaths of properties and keeping families out of the market. Ginsburg didn’t have a specific policy proposal but said the costs of housing have risen along with the costs of materials and labor, and argued the problem doesn’t lie exclusively with developers who are trying to make a living. He also implied that the Legislature's push for project labor agreements (a type of collective bargaining agreement for construction projects and a union priority) alongside building projects has contributed to the problem. Both said Lombardo’s efforts to allocate more federal land to address the housing crunch have the potential to help, but more needs to be done. The two differed on proposals to amend the state’s rapid and uniquesummary eviction process. In 2022, Taylor supported a bill requiring a landlord to make the first court filing in an eviction case instead of a tenant and said she would do so again. The bill was later vetoed by Lombardo. She said it’s an unfair burden on the tenant to begin the legal process. “I live in a house and I have a rental property, and you hope that helps to create some income or build some wealth,” Taylor said. “The business piece is important. It really is, but the people piece is important, too.” Ginsburg said he supports the summary eviction process. Gun policies Taylor said she has “no interest in taking away people’s guns,” but she wants to make communities and schools safer. She said she’s open to limits on the sale of semiautomatic weapons. In 2023, she supported atrio of gun control billslater vetoed by Lombardo. The bills proposed prohibiting access to certain semiautomatic firearms to those younger than 21, criminalizing possession of guns near polling locations, cleaning up a contested state law banning “ghost guns,” and restricting access to guns for those convicted of a hate crime. Taylor said she would support the legislation again. “I want people to be able to hunt, I want people to do all of that,” Taylor said. “But people will support some restrictions. How far do they go? Don't know. But absolutely, I would support some restrictions.” Ginsburg indicated gun control measures are a nonstarter for him. Tax credits Taylor said it’s vital any tax credit program benefits all regions of Nevada and gives more to the state than it takes. Asked about efforts to expand the state’s film tax credits, Taylor said a proposal during the 2023 legislative session focused on Southern Nevada. Taylor said to support a similar measure, she needs to be able to tell Reno-area constituents how they would benefit from it. “I’m not outright opposed ... but I haven't seen a proposal yet. You hear a little bit of this, little bit of that,” Taylor said. Ginsburg shared similar sentiments, noting that he wants to ensure “we’re not giving tax credits to people that aren’t going to bring any benefit to the state.” Taylor, who opposed apublic financing package of up to $380 million for a stadium for the Oakland Athletics in Las Vegas, said she stands by her position and didn’t have a single constituent who reached out saying they supported the proposal. Ginsburg said he wasn’t a legislator at the time, didn’t hear both sides of the issue and wouldn’t weigh in on whether he would have supported the legislation.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/washoe-county-registrar-of-voters-to-take-a-leave-of-absence-ahead-of-election,True,"Washoe County interim Registrar of Voters Cari-Ann Burgess will be taking a leave of absence ahead of the November general election after experiencing “stress related health issues.” Washoe County spokespeople confirmed the leave toThe Nevada Independenton Wednesday, just six weeks before Election Day. “[Burgess] has requested a leave of absence for self-care,” county spokesperson George Guthrie wrote in a statement. “We are committed to the health and well-being of Ms. Burgess and running a smooth and fair election is a top priority for the County.” County officials wrote in the statement that the registrar of voters’ office is “prepared and confident” for the upcoming election. They did not address questions about who would fill Burgess’ leadership role as interim registrar of voters. But Guthrie said the registrar’s office consists of more than one person, and that Deputy Registrar of Voters Andrew McDonald and other experienced team members are already stepping up to fill the role. Burgess is the third registrar in a little more than two years to leave the role. ShereplacedJamie Rodriguez, who announced her resignation Jan. 2. Rodriguez said that the long hours were one reason she left the position after little more than a year full-time. “I have given everything to this position and felt that I needed to leave to allow myself a work/life balance and to be able to see family and friends again, which I have had little ability to do over the last 2 years,” Rodriguez wrote toThe Nevada Independentin an email shortly after her resignation. Rodriguez herself was an interim registrar, filling in for her predecessor, Deanna Spikula, who also noted the lack of work-life balance and increased harassment of election officials as her reasons for leaving the role after 15 years. The news of Burgess’ leave of absence comes after the swing county made national headlines following the Washoe County Commission’srefusal to certifythe results of a primary election recount. Commissionerslater reversedthe decision and certified the results. County officials also faced criticism for sending ballots tovoters who had opted outof mail voting and misprinting ballots, which led to$178,000 in reprintcosts. Republican Washoe County Commissioner Mike Clark blamed the high turnover in the county’s registrar of voters office on management and said the announcement of Burgess’ leave is “embarrassing” for the county. “We're a laughingstock,” Clark toldThe Nevada Independent. “The rest of the world is looking at Washoe County and saying, ‘What's wrong with those hicks?’ There are so many folks in the city of Reno that were offended by that TV show,Reno 911. It was a spoof … and now we're living up to it.” Clark’s speculation that management is the problem aligns with his long-standing vocal criticism of Washoe County Manager Eric Brown, who was one of the key figures behind Clark's ban from county officesfor harassmentwhen Clark was serving as the county’s assessor. Clark and Republican County Commissioner Jeanne Hermanvotednot to confirmBurgess as interim registrar of voters, haverepeatedlyvoted not to certify election results and publicly questioned the integrity of the election process. Clark has been backed by far-right activist Robert Beadles. Beadleshas targeted and sought to oust Brownand other Washoe County officials in lawsuits, falsely claiming the county’s voting process skewed election results. The lawsuit was laterdismissed with prejudice, meaning it can’t be refiled. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office said in a statement that it does not comment on county personnel issues. “Our office fully supports the Washoe County Manager's and Registrar's Offices and we are working closely with them for the successful administration of the 2024 General Election,” spokesperson Cecilia Heston wrote in an email.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevadans-have-cast-first-votes-of-the-2024-general-election,True,"Early voting isn’t scheduled to begin for another 25 days, but the first votes in Nevada’s 2024 election cycle have started to roll in through the state’s digital absentee voting system. As of Monday, in a historic first, two ballots have been cast via the digital application by Native American voters living on a reservation or colony. The secretary of state’s office kicked off the online voting option for this election cycle Saturday at the Walker River Paiute Tribe’s 93rd annual Pinenut Festival. The launch and digital voting option are part of an effort to increase voter turnout among the state’s Native American communities. Members ofNevada’s 28 Indigenous nations, bands and colonieshave faced long-standinghistorical and geographic obstaclesto casting a ballot, including long journeys to polling locations or ballot drop boxes, lack of voter registration opportunities and unreliable mail services. “For much of United States history, Native Americans have faced countless barriers to citizenship and basic voting access. Some of those barriers can be internet connectivity or distance to polling locations,” Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat, said in remarks at the launch. “Our office is dedicated to working with tribes to find creative solutions and improve the access to vote.” Aguilar also announced that the office had hired a tribal outreach coordinator, Walker River Paiute Nation citizen Cal Boone, to work with the tribes on behalf of the secretary of state’s office. Boone explained how to use the secure digital system, known as Nevada’s Effective Absentee System for Elections (EASE), to voters at the festival. The system allows people to register to vote, receive a ballot and cast it entirely online. Some festival attendees also took home informational flyers about the program so they could conduct personal research on candidates and ballot questions before casting their votes. Though internet access is needed to access EASE, tribal voters who can connect to their tribal administration's Wi-Fi or have access to cell service can use the electronic system. Proponents of the program say it overcomes historical barriers and increases tribal members' options for casting a ballot and participating in the election. Tribal citizens must choose the Nevada tribal land that they reside on before confirming voter registration details and marking their ballot. Established in 2014, EASE was designed to accommodate active duty members of the United States Armed Forces, their spouses and dependents, and Nevada voters living outside the country. The voting option expanded to residents with disabilities who may struggle to get to a voting location in 2021. Alaw passed in 2023allowed tribal citizens who live on a reservation or colony to use the system. Though Native American votershad access tothe system during the primary elections and presidential preference primary, they did not use it. Estimates based on U.S. Census data place Nevada’s Native American voting-age population at about 70,000 people. The option to use EASE is new for Native Nevadans, and it's unlikely to be used by the entire population because the bill just recently passed. However, experts have noted that adoption rates of the program are increasing, and that’s in part because of outreach. The more that the Nevada Native American population knows about EASE, the more that number is expected to rise. It’s difficult to quantify Native voter turnout rates because of the lack of data collection for the demographic, unlike forLatino,BlackandAsianvoters. But in spite of the data gaps, leaders behind the Native vote mobilization efforts in Nevada in 2020 said thatturnout was historic, with some experts saying turnout in 2020was up 25 percent from 2016. The expanded voting options and higher turnout rates are the result of decades of advocacy and a 2016 lawsuit from the Pyramid Lake and Walker River Paiute tribes, whichsuedthe secretary of state and two counties for violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The lawsuit noted some people living on reservations had to drive 96 round-trip miles to access in-person voter registration and voting booths because there were no polling locations on reservations, along with other prohibitive voting barriers. The court ruled in favor of the tribes, requiring satellite polling locations at the reservations  ahead of the election that year.In the time since then, members of Native American tribes in Nevadalaunchednonpartisan andnonprofit organizationsgeared toward increasing turnout and have advocated for policies to increase voter access. State lawmakers have alsopassed legislationaimed at improving election systems, including legislation in 2023 that requires county clerks who serve tribal areas to meet with the tribes in odd-numbered years to discuss upcoming elections, polling places and assistance a tribe will need, and a 2021 law that allows tribes to request gubernatorial approval for tribal agencies to becomeautomatic voter registration agencies. Aguilar said that in this year’s general election, there will be 18 Election Day locations, 12 early vote locations and eight ballot drop boxes on tribal land. He added that the secretary of state’s office is working closely with tribes to encourage tribal citizens to become poll workers on their reservations and colonies.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-partisan-senate-does-jacky-rosens-kill-em-with-kindness-approach-work,True,"When Vice President Kamala Harris came to Las Vegas in early January for a rally with the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, she singled out her former Senate colleague Jacky Rosen. Harris delivered the usual niceties that Democrats say about other Democrats — that Rosen is the same person regardless of whether she’s on camera, that she cares about working people, etc. But then Harris — who was still months away from being elevated to party standard bearer — said something else. “Jacky is somebody who comes off as being very nice, and she is,” Harris said. “But she is cutthroat, too. She will not tolerate anything less than a fight when it is for the right reasons and for the right folks who are doing good work.” Rosen, a former computer programmer and synagogue president from Henderson who served one term in the House before defeating Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in 2018, is rarely a flamethrower or a peacock, more affable colleague than partisan grandstander. Some senators’ currency is media attention; others are known for their erudite mastery of a policy niche; some operate on ruthless instinct. Rosen’s approach is all about friendliness — but, as Harris alluded to, kindness can be killer. As a member of the exclusive club of 100, she has remained relatively under the radar. Unlike 15 percent of her colleagues, she’s never run for president or vice president. She’s not part of the third of her caucus to serve in a Democratic leadership role. And, as a first-term senator, she has a lot of seniority to accrue before any committee chairmanships are in reach. Instead, her colleagues and partners in Nevada describe Rosen as a friendly but persistent advocate for Nevada — more focused on the state’s unique needs and industries rather than being a national thought leader. On a few key issues — Israel, antisemitism, technology — she is a sought-out voice among her peers and the press. Because of her background in computer programming, she has an eye for cybersecurity and tech-related legislation. But she keeps much of her focus on her state, with a legislative portfolio focused on tourism, small businesses and veterans. It’s that unobtrusive attitude that makes up the bulk of Republican criticism. Former President Donald TrumpcalledRosen a “lightweight” on the convention stage in July; her opponent Sam Brownrefersto her as a “rubber stamp.” Relatively unheralded by national audiences, Nevada Republicans often grouse that she’s bland — but acknowledge she doesn’t provoke much personal antipathy. Rosen’s resume is fairly standard for first-term senators, though sherankshighly compared to her peers onbipartisanshipandeffectivenessmetrics. Her electoral performance in November will hinge in large part on the “yes” votes she took on trademark Democratic legislation, and whether each party can convince voters that those policies benefited them or not. In interviews with more than 20 lobbyists, staffers, colleagues and Nevada politicos, those who know Rosen describe a senator who is well-prepared, results-oriented and almost disarming in her normalcy — multiple people described conversations with her as “refreshing” compared to her more buttoned-up colleagues. Staff say she rarely makes it through the airport in Las Vegas or Reno without hugging someone she knows and inquiring about their family. She’s known to get in the weeds on federal projects in Nevada, from Lake Tahoe to local community centers. And those who have sat in private meetings with her say they’ve learned to come prepared — Rosen frequently asks where various local interest groups and communities stand on each issue, including conservative ones, and likes to build consensus. Now running for re-election for the first time in a state known for tight races, Rosen is banking on voters rewarding her staid, neighborly approach to politics. Despite a six-year term that’s encompassed a pandemic, an insurrection and some of the most consequential legislation in recent history, colleagues still describe her as the archetypal synagogue president — warm, welcoming and explicit about what she wants to achieve. “I always tell people never mistake being nice for not being tough,” Rosen said in an interview in her Senate office, a space once occupied by Barack Obama. “You can be nice. You get things done. And when you have to be tough, you bring it out … trust me, I can be plenty tough. But you don't have to be every moment.” Senate reputation When Rosen arrived in the Senate in 2019, her first goal was to do what any new hire does — network. Rosen worked for decades as a computer programmer and systems analyst for the Summa Corporation and Southwest Gas, among other companies in Southern Nevada. She brings a programmer’s mindset to problem solving and a corporate workplace mentality to the Senate. She set up meetings with each of the chairs and ranking members on the committees she was assigned to, sharing her background and seeing where they might have mutual interests. “As a former programmer, a systems analyst, you just want to be sure that you're covering all your bases, and you want to think logically about how you're going to fit into the puzzle,” Rosen said. Rosen is one of just 15 sitting senators who had no political experience when she first ran for federal office, and one of 24 who has a business background. Margy Feldman, the Nevada chapter lead of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, counts Rosen as one of her first friends in Nevada. Feldman moved to Southern Nevada in 2016, and met Rosen at a fundraiser during her run for the House. Feldman said Rosen initially struck her as a stereotypical data analyst — a bit shy and soft-spoken. But now in the eighth year of her political career, she’s watched Rosen grow more comfortable while retaining her trademark friendliness. “I've watched her almost be awkward in the beginning,” Feldman said. “And now she commands the room.” Rosen’s Democratic colleagues raved about her intelligence and work ethic. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) called her one of the “smartest people in the United States Senate.” Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD), Rosen’s longtime chairman on the Small Business Committee, described her as a diligent advocate. “She's extremely effective in getting her legislation moving forward,” Cardin said. “She's very active. I can't remember her ever missing a meeting.” In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) praised Rosen’s leadership on infrastructure and Israel. “When Jacky puts her mind to something — she gets it done,” Schumer said. Her data background — and willingness to work bipartisanly — is appreciated by Republicans too. “Her technical skills and her career [are] huge,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). “[There’s] a lot of AI discussion that we have and cybersecurity — those are all really topical issues. She’s known to be familiar with it.” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), her 2018 Senate classmate, called Rosen a “good friend.” A moderating influence who has chosen to retire from the Senate, the former Republican presidential nominee holds his Democratic colleague in high esteem. “I like Jacky Rosen,” he said. “She's a terrific personality and someone who is easy to work with and is not afraid to work on a bipartisan basis.” Stakeholders and lobbyists in Nevada had similar praise for Rosen, who is considered accessible and engaged. Known as a go-getter, lobbyists say she is not overly fastidious, willing to move quickly on floor action. . Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve, a nonpartisan, called Rosen “easy to work with.” Schieve said Rosen called her to talk about the Washoe County lands bill and see how she might incorporate affordable housing into it, walking Schieve through its provisions. “That’s not to say that her office and my office might [not] have a disagreement on some issues we might be working on, like the lands bill,” Schieve said. “But she will always call me and be like, ‘Hey, tell me more.’ She wants to learn and get educated about the things that do concern us.” Former Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, now the president of UNR, said Rosen is assiduous in searching for federal funding opportunities for the university. He was her guest to the State of the Union this year — a messaging opportunity for an in-cycle Democrat to appear with a popular Republican ex-governor while he serves in a nonpartisan role, sure, but an experience Sandoval called “one of the great honors of [his] life.” “I consider her a friend,” Sandoval said. “Sometimes she has to say no, and that's part of what I appreciate about her. She’s always honest, and she does her homework every time she comes to campus.” Rosen the policymaker Rosen said she felt she had three significant experiences to bring to bear in the Senate, none of them expressly political in nature — her computer programming background, her time as a caretaker for elderly parents and in-laws and her experience as a synagogue president. On each, she identified a key Republican to partner with. Her attitude is recognizable to those familiar with Jewish communities — navigating the synagogue and its internal politics (“Two Jews, three opinions” is a popular adage) can be a task as formidable as Congress. And while Rosen is in many respects the quintessential Jewish mom (staff say she vehemently insists the whole team has lunch together and ensures everyone eats when running to and from events in Nevada), the skills she honed as synagogue president also manifest as trying to identify areas of agreement rather than harping on differences. On STEM issues, she found Capito to be interested — the two co-founded the Women in STEM caucus, and Rosen’s first bill to be signed into law, by President Donald Trump in 2020, was the Capito co-sponsoredBuilding Blocks of STEM Act. President Joe Biden has since signed two more of her bipartisan technology-related bills — theMobile Health Care Act, to improve mobile health care delivery in underserved areas, and theData Mapping to Save Moms’ Lives Act, to identify where poor maternal health outcomes and a lack of broadband service intersect. In a body known for its aging members — and corresponding lack of understanding of the internet — Rosen stands out. Lobbyists described her knowledge of computer science as being far beyond their understanding; one recalled a startup founder client who had given Rosen back-end access to their mapping software so she could explore it herself by the end of their meeting. Her legislative approach is often based in the problem-solving nature of computer programming. Many of her bills aim to make government more efficient or responsive, expanding thereachof various grant programs orcompellingthe government to collect more data. Rosen speaks about this strategy in the parlance of her former career. “We do [have] a lot of grants and programs, but they're no good if people can't find them [or] can't get to them,” Rosen said. “We have to streamline and modernize. We can get rid of some of the redundancy.” On palliative care, she co-founded the Comprehensive Care Caucus with Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI). And for Jewish issues and on Israel, she and Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) have shepherded a host of bills into law, including successfully elevating the global envoy on antisemitism post to an ambassadorship andexpanding and reauthorizingHolocaust education initiatives. In an interview, Lankford called Rosen a “great partner” on those issues. Her bipartisan attitude is borne out of practicality — Rosen noted that more than 90 percent of the bills she introduces have a GOP co-sponsor because that increases chances of passage — but also because in becoming friendly with Republicans, she’s better able to identify commonalities between states, from nursing shortages to wildfires to lack of broadband. “I'm not going to not work with you because we might disagree on immigration or choice,” Rosen said. “I got veterans to take care of. I got broadband to put up in Northern Nevada or underserved areas. I got 4,000 nurses short in Nevada.” Part of the Democratic majority Set to be part of the majority for the first time in her career, the 117th Congress began with a day that fundamentally changed Rosen — Jan. 6, 2021. Rosen recalled her young staffers fielding calls from their parents, and feeling a sense of personal responsibility for their safety, telling them to break through emergency exit doors and run to Union Station to save themselves. Did it bother her then, to turn around and work with some of the very same Republicans who had threatened the peaceful transfer of power? The day — and the subsequent failed impeachment — served to further deteriorate relations between the parties. For a senator who had made bipartisan relationships her calling card, Rosen said she learned to compartmentalize. “I just knew that we had to continue to do our job,” she said. “That's what people are counting on me for, and I wasn't going to let that alter the way that I work with folks.” From 2021 to 2023, she was the body’s busiest Democratic senator — serving on six committees — and was tapped to be part of the bipartisan working group that hashed out what became the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, writing the sections on airports and broadband. The final product incorporated numerous ideas of hers, including a program tofundmiddle-mile broadband connectivity. In the years since the law’s 2021 passage, Rosen has been active in trying to get Nevada an outsized share of federal funding. She joked that she had Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on speed dial to discuss the proposed Brightline West high-speed rail project to link Southern California and Southern Nevada. “[When] she called, she was nice about it, but very persistent in making sure that we knew why she considered this to be important and what it would mean for Nevada,” Buttigieg said, noting that she’s equally forceful when advocating for smaller-scale projects such as Interstate 15 improvements. Brightline ultimately received $3 billion in public funding — the lion’s share of the grant program and most of the $3.75 billion it applied for. “Would we have gotten Brightline if it wasn’t for Senator Rosen?” asked Rob Benner, the secretary-treasurer of the Building and Construction Trades Council for Northern Nevada. “That’s a serious question.” That willingness to work the phones extends beyond Cabinet secretaries. One lobbyist said Rosen is accessible and responsive — if she’s not personally present at a meeting, it’s because she’s at committee rather than hobnobbing at the Capitol Hill Club. In the 50-50 Senate of the 117th Congress, Rosen also provided a critical vote on two bills that received no Republican support — the 2021 American Rescue Plan, the pandemic-era economic stimulus that included personal checks to Americans and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the Democratic smorgasbord that allowed Medicare to negotiate the price of drugs and made historic investments in clean energy. Opponents (and liberals) say that for all of her bipartisan bona fides and relationships with Republicans, those votes demonstrate that she’s a Democrat when it counts. And Republican strategists believe those votes are the terrain in which they might defeat her — not because they were party-line, but because they authorized trillions in new spending. Brown, her GOP opponent, has attacked her frequently on the economy, arguing that Democratic spending drove inflation. (Economists point topandemic-era shiftsin the structure of the global economy; Democrats blamecorporate greed.) A Republican strategist, granted anonymity to speak candidly, cautioned that voters don’t often care about individual bills senators voted on — and that the path to defeating her is in tying her to the Biden economy broadly. They said this is especially true because it can be difficult to put a hit on Rosen, though they added that attacks on her 2017stockreportingviolationswere “good” but not “lethal.” Republicans have also sought to highlight herpersonal wealthandcampaign contributionsfrom the pharmaceutical industry. “She’s pretty vanilla,” the strategist said. “She saw [Sen. Catherine Cortez] Masto (D-NV) and said, ‘I can be more boring than her.’” Regardless, Rosen argues that each vote is taken in the interest of Nevada. “[The IRA] was a really great bill,” she said. “I was very proud to work on that and continue to deliver for Nevada.” The class of 2018 In a freshman class littered with firebrands, Rosen stands out by virtue of her low national profile. That’s somewhat by design. Of the eight senators in the class of 2018, two — Romney and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) — have chosen to retire rather than face parties they no longer feel at home in. Several who flipped previously blue seats have become right-wing renegades. As one of just two Democrats in the 2018 class, Rosen’s career is best compared to Sinema’s — and has played out stylistically in direct contrast to the Arizonan, whose public tussling with her liberal peers throughout the early part of Biden’s presidency made her thescorn of her own partyand ultimately ended her political career. When Rosen contradicts party leaders, by contrast, it’s often on Nevada-specific issues, or with fellow vulnerable Democrats. Rosen didn’t speculate on how her and Sinema’s paths have diverged — “I’ll let everybody else debate about that,” she said — but emphasized that her focus has always been on Nevada. When she stands up to her party, she said, it’s because of some conflict with a Nevada-based constituency, rather than shifting ideology. “Everybody sent me here to represent Nevada,” Rosen said. “So I have no problem standing up where I need to when it comes to miners, border security, police, some of those things.” Unlike her moderate peers in the class, Rosen is seeking another term. Romney thinks that’s because she’s a Democrat at the end of the day. “I'm old, Kyrsten Sinema is an independent, and Jacky is a solid Democrat,” Romney said of his freshman classmates. “She’s the one holding the fort in Nevada for her party.” For her part, Rosen said she knows that if re-elected, in a landscape without Sinema, Romney or Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), who is also retiring, her voice will carry more weight in the Democratic caucus. She sees that as an opportunity to foster bipartisanship rather than a desire to be a holdout. “I'm going to try to see where I can bring folks from both sides together to fill that role, as I've been doing — and maybe take a more prominent role in doing that,” she said. Biden was unable to enact the entirety of his proposed Build Back Better agenda because Manchin and Sinema found certain provisions unworkable. If Democrats have a trifecta after the election, Harris is likely to take a run at some of the policies that were left on the cutting room floor — universal preschool and paid leave, investments in child and home care and expanding Medicare’s coverage areas, among others. But if re-elected, don’t expect Rosen to become the next Manchin or Sinema by default. She believes more investment in ‘soft infrastructure’ is needed. “We put all this money in infrastructure, but we need to build a workforce,” Rosen said. “Workforce needs child care. So these things are all interconnected. “Some of those things were left on the table,” she continued. “I hope that we can continue to do those, and the relationships I've built as being bipartisan, independent and effective will get me through the next six years to do that.” 'Agree where you can and fight where you must' While Republicans — as Romney suggested — may think of Rosen as a tried and true Democrat, their willingness to partner with her on legislation — even in an election year, when requests to co-sponsor bills typically dry up by the spring — suggests they see her efforts to cross the aisle as genuine and worthwhile. Since May, 10 Republican senators have co-sponsored her bills, typically on national security-focused legislation. By comparison, vulnerable Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Bob Casey (D-PA) have attracted just six and five Senate Republicans, respectively, to join their non-resolution bills in that same time period. Sens. Jon Tester (D-MT) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) have found one Republican each willing to sign onto their legislation. The same is true when looking at Republican senators allowing in-cycle Democrats to co-sponsor their bills. Since May, Rosen has been added as a co-sponsor on 13 Republican bills. In that same period, Casey co-sponsored seven Republican bills; Brown five; and Tester and Baldwin just three. Colleagues and Rosen herself have said her record of bipartisanship is based on true relationships. Rosen is friendly with colleagues, peppering her fellow senators in the elevator with questions about their families and lives back home rather than policy disagreements — which she says she saves for the floor. Some Republican senators acknowledged the two had worked together, (“We’re both tourism states,” said Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL)) but didn’t offer much else. Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC), Rosen’s ranking member on the tourism subcommittee, said the quiet part out loud when he wouldn’t say anything positive about his colleague — but didn’t bash her either. “It’s election season,” Budd said. “Let’s say nice things afterwards.” That commitment to bipartisanship means Rosen has relationships with people who actively campaign against her. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA)went to Las Vegasin early September to stump for Brown; days later, she and Rosen werepartneringon Arab-Israeli military cooperation. Of course, it’s not always kumbaya. Rosen gets deeply frustrated at Republican opposition to abortion or expanding the child tax credit. Prickly about Nevada in particular, she publiclysnappedat Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) over his comments on a proposed bump stock ban, the weapon used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting (“Shame on him for disrespecting the dead.”), andhammeredPostmaster General Louis DeJoy over his proposed — and ultimately dropped — plan torelocatemail processing in Reno to Sacramento. (“It’s Nevada, sir. Please say it correctly.”) Rosen’s internal motto is “Agree where you can and fight where you must” — and she says maintaining those relationships allows her to do both. “She's not afraid to talk to any of them about it, and they will listen because she is friendly,” Cortez Masto said. “She is not somebody that's targeted or offensive or coming after them.” ‘Nevada first’ Cortez Masto and Rosen are among the closest-working pairs of senators from one state in the chamber; the two first met when Cortez Masto was attorney general and reached out to faith leaders to discuss human trafficking. Cortez Masto said while she had no inclination at the time that Rosen would end up in politics, she’s not surprised her now-friend made it to the Senate. Cortez Masto is known, in Nevada circles, to have more of an in with Democratic leadership; Rosen brings the relationships with Republicans. They’ve nicknamed each other “The Prosecutor” (Cortez Masto) and “The Closer” (Rosen), working in tandem to build a case and find the votes for it. “People know, particularly amongst my colleagues … it's Nevada first,” Cortez Masto said. “That's where her focus is.” Nevada, as a small state, has a long history of senators who have made pursuing federal dollars their calling card over being national thought leaders. Even Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), who rose to the rank of Senate Majority Leader after beginning his career with a slogan of “independent like Nevada,”took great painsto send hundreds of millions to Nevada and look out for its industries, even as he became one of the chamber’s most impactful partisan operators. As the Senate becomes more of a partisan cesspool and Nevada’s political culture becomes more cutthroat than cozy — arguably both relics of Reid — the line Rosen is attempting to thread between her state-centric approach and the divisive nature of partisan politics is narrow. She’s banking that voters will still reward her approach, even as Brown uses her voting record totie herto Biden and Harris. “I think that the respect and friendship that I've earned amongst my peers, both on my own side — [the] Democratic side — and the Republican side, really put me in a position to continue to get things done,” Rosen said. “I always try to find those spaces to do that.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/d-c-download-miriam-adelson-jews-have-a-sacred-duty-to-vote-for-trump,True,"I was on-site Thursday for former President Donald Trump’s D.C. event with Las Vegas-based GOP megadonor Miriam Adelson to discuss antisemitism. Neither talked about Nevada (bummer!), but there were certainly insights to be gleaned about their relationship — one of the most critical in fundraising and Israel policy circles. Let’s get into it. The News of the Week: Donald and Miriam Adelson, the wife of the late gaming magnate Sheldon Adelson and an ardent supporter of her native Israel, has been among the chief financiers of Trump’s political ambitions. Since 2016, the Adelsons have given hundreds of millions of dollars to super PACs supporting Trump. They were rewarded well by him in the White House — Trump accomplished a number of the Israel lobby’s goals, including moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,recognizingthe Golan Heights as being part of Israel andwithdrawingfrom the Iran nuclear deal. In 2018, Trumpawarded Adelsonthe Presidential Medal of Freedom. This presidential election cycle, Miriam’s first since Sheldon’s death in 2021, she initiallystayed neutralin the Republican primary beforereportedly pledgingto spend $100 million, as she did in 2020, on his re-election campaign. While the New York Timesreportedthat Trump aides sent angry text messages to Adelson during the summer about the personnel of her super PAC, she had nothing but praise for him at Thursday’s event. “We Jews are a purposeful people, and President Trump is [a] purposeful man,” Adelson said while introducing the former president. “He is a true friend of the Jewish people.” Trump made several policy pledges in his speech, including taking away accreditation for universities that tolerate antisemitism and prosecuting them for civil rights violations, bringing back his2017 travel banand deporting people who want to eliminate Israel. Jewish Americans are one of the most persistently Democratic voting blocs. A2021 Pew Research studyfound that 71 percent identify as Democrats; Trump, during his speech, repeatedly groused at how poor his margins were with Jewish voters. The Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), where Sheldon served on the board of directors, believes that between the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses andrisingantisemitism, Republicans including Trump have a chance to reach record high levels of Jewish support. The organization isrunninga $15 million ad campaign in swing states to that effect. In her speech, Adelson told attendees that Jews have a “sacred duty” to vote for Trump, “in gratitude for everything he has done and trust in everything he will yet do.” But she also made overtures to Jews with opposing viewpoints, beginning her speech by heralding the diversity within the Jewish community. “Despite our differences and disagreements, we are a bigmeshugenah(crazy) family,” Adelson said. “Like siblings who go their separate ways, but reunite in times of joy or hardship, we are responsible for one another. When it matters, we look out for each other.” Trump, to put it lightly, was not as inclusive. Bemoaning that, after all of the Israel policy decisions he made, his share of the Jewish vote only increased marginally between 2016 and 2020, he warned Jewish voters that they would be at fault if he loses this cycle. “In my opinion, the Jewish people would have a lot to do with the loss,” he said, lamenting that a recent poll had him at only 40 percent support among Jews — which would be a generational high. He also framed the stakes of the election as existential for Israel. “If I do win, Israel will be safe and secure, and we will stop the toxic poison of antisemitism from spreading all over America and all over the world,” Trump said. “But if I don't win, I believe Israel will be eradicated.” The Nevada Angle Trump spent time detailing his relationship with both Adelsons. Sheldon, he said, was always agitating for the next thing even as colleagues were celebrating a prior achievement. “Her husband would drive me crazy,” Trump said, gesturing at Miriam. “‘You have to do this. You have to do that.’ You don't know what I had to put up with.” He referred to Miriam several times throughout the speech as “a great lady, a great woman, my friend” and addressed various comments directly to her. The entire event reiterated just howcriticalthe 78-year-old, whose net worth is estimated at over $30 billion, is in Republican politics, even after Sheldon’s death, and therefore how important her priorities vis-a-vis Israel are. The Impact For every policy promise Trump made about antisemitism, he made another comment disparaging Jewish Democrats — saying they needed their heads examined and referring to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) as “Hamas all the way.” It was pretty par for the course for the former president, and a good reminder that Jewish voters are not a monolith — as Trump himself noted, several Jewish organizations have taken part in protests against Israel and in support of Gazans devastated by the war. In a state where Jews make up about 3 percent of the population — larger than the margin by which Biden won Nevada in 2020 — they’re as critical a voting bloc as any in the Silver State. As I’ve written about before in thecontextof the Senate race, the RJC firmly believes this is the cycle where Republicans make significant gains. We’ll see if Trump’s messaging helps or hurts. Around the Capitol 🏈Titus v. Tonko —Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) talked sports betting and gaming legislation in Congress at aSemafor event, including analyzing the latest iteration of Rep. Paul Tonko’s (D-NY)Safe Betting Act, which would ban in-game sports betting advertising and betting on college sports. Titus said that Tonko is coming at the issue from an addiction standpoint, while she thinks the gaming industry and state regulators have been successful in setting responsible rules and federal regulation is a slippery slope. (Alternate headline here: Las Vegas congresswoman against new restrictions on gaming; sky is blue) ☢️Bipartisanship not totally radioactive—Reps. Mark Amodei (R-NV) and Susie Lee (D-NV) partnered onlegislationto improve health care for veterans exposed to radiation at the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR). A 2000 law provided free health care for nuclear weapons workers whose illnesses were contracted due to their employment. Similarly, the 2022 PACT Act made having served in Vietnam or in the Middle East presumptive for certain health conditions, qualifying those veterans for free treatment from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Amodei and Lee’s bill would establish the presumption that veterans who served at the NTTR were exposed to radiation, qualifying them for free health care for radiation-borne illnesses. 💸Government shutdown countdown: 9 days—Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) put abillon the House floor that would extend government funding at its current level for six months and require proof of citizenship to vote when registering. As expected, it failed, with the opposition of nearly all Democrats — including the three Nevadans — and several Republican defectors. Amodei, an appropriator, supported the bill, but predicted that a three-month stopgap will emerge as the final product. 🏀Coming up Aces—It was a WNBA-heavy week for the Nevada delegation. Leetook to the House floorto congratulate Las Vegas Aces center A’ja Wilson for breaking the league’s single-season points record, and then held a fundraiser Thursday night at the Washington Mystics vs. Indiana Fever game in D.C.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/green-party-cannot-land-on-nevada-presidential-ballot-u-s-supreme-court-rules,True,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected an attempt by the Green Party to regain access to the presidential ballot in Nevada. The Nevada Green Party last week filed anemergency applicationasking the nation’s highest court to overturn arulingfrom the state Supreme Court that the party’s attempt to qualify for the ballot did not abide by state rules. The lawyer representing the party was Jay Sekulow, who previously represented former President Donald Trump and argued the state Supreme Court violated the party’s due process and equal protection rights. There were no noted dissents in the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling, which did not provide a reason for denying the emergency application. Therulingis the final nail in the coffin for the Nevada Green Party’s efforts to gain a spot on the presidential ballot and marks another win for the Nevada Democratic Party, which sought to block the party from qualifying for the ballot amid fears that it could siphon off votes from dissatisfied left-leaning Nevadans. The Green Party has not qualified for the ballot in the Silver State since 2008. The Nevada Green Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nevada Democrats had argued that the minor party’s petition contained the wrong affidavit language, invalidating the signatures gathered to land on the ballot. The Nevada Supreme Court agreed, with two justices dissenting. The affidavits signed by petition circulators included the language for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot, not minor political parties, which omits a sentence stating the circulator believes all signees were registered voters in the county they reside. This legally deficient language was recommended by the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office in itsguidefor minor political parties, but the high court’s majority ruled that this error did not absolve the Green Party’s legal obligation to use the right form. Dissenting Justices Kristina Pickering and Douglas Herndon wrote that they believed the ruling “excuses an egregious error by the Secretary of State's office that will result in a significant injustice.” The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling all but ensures that no party with the potential to play spoiler in the election has qualified for the ballot, as independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will also not appear on Silver State ballots.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-assembly-district-4-candidates-lisa-cole-and-ryan-hampton,True,"The race for Assembly District 4 in the Nevada Legislature could be key to overriding vetoes issued by Gov. Joe Lombardo. The open seat in northwest Las Vegas is being vacated by Assemblyman Richard McArthur, a Republican, who launched an unsuccessful bid for state Senate. The seat has been Republican-held since 2020, but it is no stranger to tight races and has narrow voter registration margins between the two major parties. The stakes are high. Democrats are vying for a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature, which would allow them to override any veto issued by Lombardo, who vetoed arecord75 bills last year. While Democrats are one seat shy of a supermajority in the Senate, they hold one in the Assembly, but only barely — 28 out of the 42 seats — meaning they have little room for error in November. Because Assembly District 4 is likely the only pickup opportunity for Democrats, a victory could bring some breathing room if a Democratic seat turns red. The two candidates are Democrat Ryan Hampton, an addiction recovery advocate, and Lisa Cole, a lawyer and the vice president of an economic development small business. In an interview, Cole said she never seriously considered running for office until last summer, when Lombardo’s team gauged her interest to run for the open seat. Cole had recently been featured in aLas Vegas Review-Journalarticleabout the Apex Industrial Park, an area in North Las Vegas that officials have long hoped to turn into a manufacturing hub and where Cole’s business has coordinated infrastructure projects. Cole said she has an “interesting skill set” for a first-time political candidate, touting her knowledge in land development and water rights and that she passed the bar exam last year. Hampton also had not considered running for office until he learned that McArthur was vacating the seat. In an interview, he touted his nationwide advocacy for addiction recovery, role in authoring state and federal legislation and collaboration with multiple presidential administrations from both parties. Hampton condemnedaccusationsfrom the Better Nevada PAC — a group tied to Lombardo that has endorsed Cole — that he supports the “effective legalization of fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine,” despite his own past struggles with opioid use disorder. When asked for the basis for these accusations, a PAC official referred to two posts on X by Hampton related to a (since-scaled back)Oregon measurethat decriminalized possession of small amounts of hard drugs. Thefirstpost does not appear to show Hampton’s support for the bill (he instead copied the description of alinked videowhere another person said it was “the right approach”) and thesecondlinked to a video where Oregonians expressed support for the measure, though Hampton did not explicitly say where he stood. The measure also did not legalize hard drugs but rather expanded access to drug treatment and recovery services that would be paid with marijuana tax revenue. The official alsoreferredto a quote from Hampton last year that he does not support criminalizing addiction, though that is a different stance than legalizing hard drugs. “They really should be ashamed of themselves,” Hampton said. “I believe some of these tactics are just building into the stigma that folks have been trying for a long time to combat, and I, for one, am ready to just cut through it.” See below for a closer look at both candidates’ policy views. School choice Health care Elections Housing Gun control Environment Criminal justice Tax credits Vetoes Gaming School choice An education policy that will likely resurface during next year’s legislative session is Opportunity Scholarships, a program that helps subsidize the cost of attending private schools in Nevada for certain low-income students that is championed by Lombardo and opposed by Democrats. Cole said she thinks school choice options such as Opportunity Scholarships “make a lot of sense.” “It's unfortunate that we have as many one or two star schools that we do in Clark County,” Cole said. “Providing somebody a lifeline for their children to be able to get a better education than what they're zoned for, I think is really important.” Meanwhile, Hampton expressed some reservations about Opportunity Scholarships and the use of public dollars for private schooling, but he said there should be exceptions for people currently receiving the scholarships and would be open to providing such scholarships for siblings of current recipients. “I don’t think that we should be disrupting the education of students who are already involved,” Hampton said. Health care In his campaign, Hampton has focused on his efforts on a 13-part plan to tackle the state’s drug crisis. Theplanincludes enforcing laws that guarantee insurance companies will cover mental health and addiction treatment, increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates and upping the state’s supply of Naloxone, a drug that can save people experiencing an opioid overdose He has also emphasized his experience taking on pharmaceutical companies — heonce representedthousands of people with claims against Purdue Pharma, the company headed by the notorious family of David Sackler, who Hampton has personally faced off against during court proceedings. He wants to lower prescription drug costs — he expressed an openness to supporting AB250, the bill vetoed by Lombardo toallow the stateto adopt drug prices negotiated by Medicare — and have a mental health care system that aligns with aRecovery Oriented System of Care, such as building up the state’s network of recovery options, including community groups and housing. Cole, meanwhile, said she is “neutral” onAB250, which did not receive any Republican support in the Legislature last year, and that she would like to learn more about adopting drug prices negotiated by Medicare. Her priorities on health care include bolstering the number of medical residencies in the state to help shore up doctor shortages, and looking into increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates. Cole and Hampton said they would be open to supporting  but would have to look more intoAB108, a bill thatstalled last yearwhere Nevada would join a nurse licensure compact, allowing Nevada nurses to have a multistate license recognized by any of the pact’s participants. Elections Nevadans will vote on aballot questionthis year to require voter ID — and the candidates have differing opinions on it. Cole said a voter ID requirement makes “a lot of sense” to improve trust in the state’s election system, while Hampton worried that the practice could lead to voter disenfranchisement. Hampton also defended the security of the state’s election system (there is no proof of widespread fraud in Nevada’s elections) and supports how the state runs its elections. A particularly politically contentious issue is so-called “ballot harvesting,” the process legalized permanently in Nevada in 2021 that allows voters to collect and submit ballots of people they know. Former President Donald Trump and his alliesfalsely claimedin 2020 that this practice led to massive voter fraud, but Republicans have since moderated their positions because of its legality. While Cole does not believe there was widespread fraud in 2020, she said she would be open to changes in the state’s ballot collection system, such as limiting the number of ballots someone can collect. She also worried that the permanent legalization of the practice in 2021 could allow it to become “unfettered.” Hampton strongly disagreed with this characterization, saying there is no reason to believe it could become out of control because there is no evidence that it leads to widespread voter fraud. “These are fear-based tactics,” Hampton said. “Let's start operating on fact instead of fiction.” Housing An issue withrare bipartisan supportin Nevada is the freeing up of federally owned land for affordable housing development. Cole said she supports the idea “100 percent” because she thinks the current situation creates land shortages and drives up prices. She is interested in looking into more areas within Clark County that can be nominated to be freed up by the feds. Meanwhile, Hampton also said he was open to the proposal, but he cautioned that any effort has to include guardrails to prevent massive property owners and “Wall Street” companies from purchasing the available land and maintaining high prices. A housing policy with less bipartisan support is the state’ssummary eviction process, where the tenant is required to make the first legal filing in an eviction lawsuit, not the landlord. Aproposalstalled in the Legislature last year that would have required the landlord to make the first filing. Hampton said he would support reforms to the process, including a requirement that the landlord file first. Cole, meanwhile, supports the system as is. “Creating a system that is too onerous for landlords leads to less supply of available units and thereby increases costs,” Cole said. “We all know that’s not a good idea.” Gun control Lombardovetoed a trio of gun control billslast year that would have placed restrictions on gun ownership for people convicted of a hate crime, raised the legal age to purchase certain firearms to 21 and criminalized bringing a gun within 100 feet of an election site. Cole said she supported all of these vetoes, and that there is a “pretty high bar” for gun regulation in the Second Amendment, which states that the right to own a firearm “shall not be infringed.” Hampton said he supports gun control measures but notably, he said he opposes a ban on assault weapons in the state — a divergence from Democrats across the country who have sought to impose such a ban. Hampton is a gun owner and said he thinks that the state can institute policies “protecting the rights of responsible gun owners and keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals without imposing an assault weapons ban in the state.” “I do know plenty of people who own assault weapons, for sport or otherwise, who are responsible gun owners,” Hampton said. Environment As a recently licensed lawyer, Cole said she is well versed in water law. One piece of legislation related to water rights that stalled in the Legislature last year,SB176, sought to address a problem known as over-appropriation, where state regulators issued more rights to use water than there was water to use. The bill would have created a program where the state would buy back water rights to prevent overuse. “I think when you have a willing water right holder that has been pumping water, and if they want to sell their water rights back to the state to solve it … it makes some sense,” said Cole, who acknowledged the existing issues surrounding the funding of such a program. Hampton, meanwhile, said he was aware of the legislation but did not say directly how he would vote on it. He added that he would back “common sense policies for water conservation.” Criminal justice Hampton expressed support for SB35, a bill passed last year thatlowered the quantity of fentanyla person must possess to trigger a drugtraffickingcharge. Cole, meanwhile, also indicated support for the legislation, but said the measure should apply to other banned drugs as well. They both expressed a desire to reduce recidivism rates in the state, a goal that was the impetus of asweeping criminal justice reform packagein 2019that Lombardo failed to scale back last year. Hampton said he views prisons as a way to isolate certain members of the community, but also as a place for rehabilitation. He wants there to be more vocational training and job placement programs for incarcerated people, more transitional housing for prisoners upon their release and increased treatment of opioid use disorder in jails. “It's become a revolving door because we're not actually getting to the root causes of why people are incarcerated,” Hampton said. Cole agreed that “the whole point of a prison is to rehabilitate the person,” but that there needs to be easier ways for prisoners to transition back into society, which could include easing job access. “We need to make sure that we have enough programs that support people who really want to change their lives,” Cole said. Tax credits Lawmakers are set to once againseek a tax creditto bolster film production in Nevada, continuing a trend of tax credits that balance efforts to diversify the state’s economy while bringing community benefits. Cole cautioned that the state would need to ensure the film crews would consider Nevada a home base, rather than just filming here briefly and then leaving town. She also said the state should be “very careful” in how it crafts tax credit agreements. “The state should get more than it's moving, like that would be the reason why you would do it,"" Cole said. Hampton argued that any tax credit should prioritize good paying jobs and diversifying the state’s economy, and that he would be open to supporting a film tax credit but needs to look into it more. Elsewhere, he would support a tax credit for businesses that voluntarily opt in to a program to become a “Recovery Friendly Workplace,” which have been shown to reduce the impact of alcohol and addiction in the workplace and eliminate barriers for employees seeking recovery treatment. Vetoes Lombardo issued a record-number of vetoes last year, and Cole’s website lists protecting Lombardo’s veto power as a top issue as to why she’s running. She acknowledged that she did not read about all of Lombardo’s vetoes, but she emphasized that she thinks his veto power is “a sign that our governmental system works.” She also said that “checks and balances will be rendered useless” if Democrats obtain a veto-proof supermajority in both chambers. Meanwhile, Hampton said he did not even know that Lombardo’s veto power was on the line until he had already announced his candidacy, and that he is not focused on the stakes of the veto power in his campaign, but rather he wants to focus on specific policy areas. Hampton added that he thinks “democracy thrives in the middle” — away from extremes on the left and right — and that he wants to work with Lombardo no matter whether Democrats have a supermajority in the Assembly or not. Gaming Lawmakers will vote next year on a constitutional amendment to remove the state ban on lotteries — and Cole and Hampton said they have concerns. Cole was skeptical that the amendment would bring in much money to the state, while Hampton worried that the introduction of a lottery could lead to increased gambling addiction in the state, “creating social costs that may outweigh any financial gains.” Updated on 9/20/24 at 7:55 a.m.  to correct that Cole wants to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates and clarify Hampton's meeting with David Sackler.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-nevadans-support-expanding-universal-preschool-funding-child-tax-credits,True,"As child care costsrise faster than wages, new polling indicates a bipartisan majority of Nevadans support implementing policies to assist families with those expenses. The survey, conducted in Spanish and English by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy, shows that a majority of Democrats and Republicans in Nevada support increasing child tax credits, expanding free universal preschool programs, subsidizing child care for low and middle-income families and enacting a national 12-week paid family and medical leave program. Steven Kull, a political psychologist at the University of Maryland and director of the Program for Public Consultation, said in an interview that the cost of child care is at the forefront for many Americans because of the increased costs of living and raising children, which contributes to high levels of support for policies designed to assist families. Families also have a comparison point with COVID, he said, noting that there was more financial support for families during the pandemic thatled to reduced child poverty, and now that those policies have ended, they are feeling the financial strain. “It’s overall contributed to some support for the idea that the federal government should mitigate the pressures that that families feel,” Kull said, adding that concern aboutdeclining birth rates and populationscould also be contributing to broader support for policies helping families. Nationally, rising child care costs have become a presidential campaign issue, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harrishighlighting proposalsto expand the federal child tax credit andcriticizingher Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, on hislack of specificson policies to help families. The Nevada Independentreached out via email to each major party candidate running for congressional office about their stance on increasing child tax credits, funding free universal preschool programs, subsidizing child care for low-and middle-income families and enacting a national 12-week paid family and medical leave program. As of Wednesday morning, two of the campaigns responded, and the candidates' campaign websites did not indicate their stances. A media representative for Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV)confirmedthat Lee supports increasing child tax credits and would be following up on the other questions. A representative for Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) said she supports all the listed policies. The high cost of child care is particularly acute in Nevada — the Silver State has the highest child care expenses relative to income of any other state, with families spending an average of about 32 percent of their income on care, according to aMarch reportfrom the personal finance site Lending Tree. The University of Maryland poll is one of many issue-focused polls the group is conducting in swing states ahead of the 2024 general election. Across all six swing states surveyed, majorities of Republicans and Democrats favor federal actions to help families, including higher child tax credits, increased tax credits for parents of newborns and federal funding to provide free preschool. In Nevada, 601 adults were polled in online opt-in surveys from Aug. 17-29. The survey, which focused on policies proposed in or moving through the House and Senate, had a margin of error of 4.5 percent. In open-ended answers, respondents wrote about the effects of skyrocketing child care costs, out-of-reach preschool education expenses and the need to support families. “It's so expensive to raise a child/children that help (in the form of child tax credits) goes a long way,” wrote one respondent. “In some families it can mean the world at the right moment.” Bipartisan majority support for increasing child tax credits More than 73 percent of Nevada survey respondents indicated that they would support raising the child tax credit to $3,600 and making it fully refundable for all parents, in line with pandemic-era child tax credits that expired in 2022. In August, the issue again took center stage as the U.S. Senate voted on a long-stalled package to expand federal child tax credits. Both of Nevada’s Democratic senatorsvotedto pass it, but, ultimately, Senate Republicans killed the proposal. The package — supported by all four Nevada representatives — had passed the House in February. The legislation would have expanded the annual child tax credit from $1,600 to $2,000 per child, made the credit refundable for the previous two tax years and offered the credit to families whose total tax bill was less than the credit amount. Poll respondents were informed in advance that the $3,600 pandemic-era child tax credit reduced federal revenues and decreased child poverty by about a third, and would likely have the same effects if reinstated. Broken out by political party, 64 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats in Nevada who were surveyed said they support the $3,600 credit. Though support for increasing child tax credits is often seen as a Democratic issue, Kull said the pandemic-era child tax credits may have created a new baseline of expectations for government support, and Republicans may be motivated to support it as a way to address declining birth rates. “There may be a shift going on so that there's less aversion to the idea that the federal government will be playing an active role in it,” he said. “It seems that the concerns related to families in general, as well as the cost of living broadly, that those are strong enough to offset some of the reservations about the federal government.” In open-ended responses, those surveyed noted the high costs of raising children and said tax credits can help families afford basic necessities and child care. “Many times I have received child tax credits and it literally put food on my children’s plates,” one respondent wrote. “And I am a full time healthcare worker with a good wage.” Additionally, 63 percent of those surveyed, including 73 percent of Democrats, said they would support providing a $6,000 tax credit to children younger than 1. Republicans were more divided on the issue, with 53 percent indicating support and 47 percent in opposition. “A $6,000 tax credit for parents with infants would provide significant financial relief during a critical time,” another respondent said. Poll shows support for federal universal preschool funding Eighty percent of respondents in Nevada favored increased funding for universal preschool, which has been shown toprovide long-term benefits for children, ranging from increased social-emotional skills to improved health outlooks. Nevada has alimited state pre-K program, with enrollment only available to families under 200 percent of the poverty level. Kull described the push for universal preschool funding as a “significant social shift” that shows support for early childhood education. As of 2023, only 7 percent of 4-year-olds in Nevada are enrolled in state-funded pre-K — one of the lowest levels in the county, according to theNational Institute for Early Education Research. Expanded funding for universal preschool was one of the top priorities in President Joe Biden’sBuild Back Better Plan, but the proposal was eventually killed in the Senate. Onlya handful of statesoffer universal pre-K. Support for universal preschool cuts across party lines in all swing states, according to the survey. That includes Nevada, where 94 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of Republicans polled support increased pre-K funding Specifically, the survey asked respondents if they’d support a proposal to give $25 billion to cities or states that want it, to help the entity create or expand preschool programs. The survey provided respondents with arguments for and against the proposal. “I don’t see why investing $25 billion in early education would ever be a bad thing,” one respondent said. Subsidizing child care for low and middle-income families is popular A bipartisan majority of Nevada respondents, 77 percent, said they would support a proposal to help low and middle-income families cover the cost of child care so that they spend no more than 7 percent of their income on those types of services. The proposal defines low-income families as those making less than $65,000 and middle-income families as those making between $65,000 and about $130,000. Higher-income families would not have their costs covered. In Nevada, about 68 percent of Republicans and 85 percent of Democrats said they would support the policy. Nationally, 72 percent of respondents indicated they were in favor, including majorities of Republicans (61 percent) and Democrats (85 percent). Broad support for paid family and medical leave for all workers Like most other states, Nevada hasno paid family or medical leavelaw. But about 70 percent of Nevadans polled said they were in favor of creating a federal paid medical and/or family leave program that would compensate employees two-thirds of their wages for 12 weeks of leave. Currently, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) only protects a subset of qualified workers from losing their jobs if they take leave without pay. Workers in companies with less than 50 employees, part-time workers and new employees do not qualify. For years, the Legislature has tried and failed to create state leave laws. In 2023, lawmakers beganrequiring companies receiving tax breaksfrom the state to provide paid family/medical leave. Lawmakers alsopassed a paid sick leave billin 2019. The paid family/medical leave proposal is overwhelmingly supported by Nevada Democrats (82 percent in favor), while only a small majority of state Republicans supported the policy (52 percent). Support in other swing states also hovers around 70 percent. This story was updated on 9/18/2024 at 8:35 a.m. to include responses from Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV).",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/horsford-intros-his-own-bill-ending-taxes-on-tips-while-also-raising-subminimum-wage,True,"Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) unveiled the “Tipped Income Protection and Support (TIPS) Act” Tuesday, an effort to put a progressive stamp on the policy effort to end taxation on tips popularized by former President Donald Trump. Horsford’s plan, unlikeRepublican-led proposalsto solely exempt tips from federal taxation, includes eliminating the federal tipped subminimum wage, aiming to improve tipped workers’ pay by raising their baseline earnings and easing their tax burden. Thesubminimum wage, currently set at $2.13, permits employers to pay employees an hourly wage below the federal minimum of $7.25 if they work in tipped industries or have disabilities, among other qualifications. Rules vary by state; Nevada is one ofseven statesthat has eliminated the subminimum wage for tip earners, with all employers required to guarantee the statewide minimum wage of $12 per hour. In 15 states, the subminimum wage is $2.13. Employers are required to make up the difference between the federal and subminimum wage when tips don’t cover it, but in practice, thismay not occur. Horsford, speaking at a press conference at the Capitol on Tuesday surrounded by restaurant workers affiliated with advocacy group One Fair Wage, positioned his bill as part of a larger fight. “The TIPS Act isn't just about wages or taxes,” he said. “It's about economic justice. It's about recognizing that service workers are the backbone of our economy.” Ending taxes on tips became a key issue in the presidential race when Trumpproposedit at a June rally in Las Vegas. His Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, soon followed with a similar pledge to end taxes on tips, and latercommittedto ending the subminimum wage andraisingthe federal minimum wage as well. Trump, who touted the idea again duringanother event in Las Vegasin August, has been light on details, including whether the exemption would apply to income and payroll taxes or if there will be an income cap. Harris isreportedly consideringa $75,000 income cap to qualify for the benefit, which would only apply tofederal income tax. Read More: Will Trump's Las Vegas idea to end taxation on tips catch on? Horsford’s proposal addresses concerns that the no tax on tips policy could be abused by corporate executives not paying tax on their bonuses by only applying to industries where tipping is customary. Saru Jarayaman, the president of One Fair Wage, noted that while tax relief — the predominant policy discussion in the presidential election pertaining to restaurant workers — would be welcome, raising base wages, as Horsford’s bill does, is more important. “Yes, it's great — let's have a little bit of extra money around tax season,” said Jarayaman, noting thattwo-thirdsof tipped workers don’t earn enough to pay federal income tax. “But what we really need is a raise.” Horsford’s bill was also immediately endorsed by the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents 60,000 service workers in Nevada and is closely allied with Nevada’s Democratic representatives in Congress. In a statement, union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said that by eliminating the subminimum wage, Horsford’s bill would benefit service workers earning less than $37,000 per year around the country. “Now, it’s time for the entire nation to follow Nevada’s lead to eliminate the subminimum wage, ensure that workers receive a fair wage, and end taxes on tips so one job is enough for workers to support their families,” he said. Horsford’s TIPS Act caps eligibility for tax exemptions at $112,500 in gross income. The existence of a cap varies across Republican proposals — legislation from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in the Senate, co-sponsored by Nevada’s two Democratic senators, has no such cap and structures the policy as a deduction. Horsford’s, by contrast, has an income cap and is structured as an exemption. It applies only to federal income tax, rather than including payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. “Those other bills don't address the subminimum wage, which is the crux of the problem,” Horsford said. “Who is supposed to live off of $2.13 an hour?” “[Republicans] didn't write any legislation,” he continued. “They just took an idea from somebody else that told them to do it. They had no details or provisions … The TIPS Act is thoughtful. It's comprehensive. It has the guardrails that are necessary.” One Republican proposal from Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) provides a tax exemption for as much as $20,000 in tips. But Las Vegas is home to several top-earning professions within the hospitality industry where workers earn far more than that — high-end servers and cocktail waitresses can make six figure incomes due to large tips. Horsford said he chose a cap of $112,500 based on the structure of prior tax provisions — the 2021 child tax credit expansion, authored by Democrats, began tophase outthe full benefit at $112,500 for heads of household. Economists have criticized proposals to end taxes on tips because of their potential toaddhundreds of billions of dollars to the federal deficit. Raising the minimum wage would likelygenerateadditional tax revenue, but when asked about potentialpay-fors, Horsford argued that service workers deserve relief and redirected the question back to Trump. “Ask Donald Trump, does he have a pay-for for his tax cuts to the 1 percent?” Horsford said. “Once he gives you an answer, then I'll talk to you.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/harris-rosen-brown-trump-do-the-nevada-senate-candidates-mirror-presidential-hopefuls,True,"Is Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) just a carbon copy of Vice President Kamala Harris? Is Sam Brown just Donald Trump reincarnated? The Nevada Senate campaigns (and supportive outside groups) are each spending millions of dollars to try to get voters to think of their opponent in the same breath as their party leader. Each candidate has tried to brand the other with the moniker of their party leaders — Rosen rarelymentions Brownwithout adding the “MAGA extremist” label, while Brown has sought to portray Rosen as a rubber stamp for Biden, and now Harris’,economic agenda. But the nature of Nevada’s electorate often makes Senate contests a race to the middle. The state’s latest activevoter registration numbersdemonstrate the political power of registered nonpartisans, who are 34 percent to Democrats’ 30 percent and Republicans’ nearly 29 percent. “The thing about Nevada politics is it's always in the middle,” said UNLV political scientist David Damore. “We generally don't have ideological candidates win here, be it the governor or the U.S. Senate. They all tend to be pretty moderate, mostly bipartisan.” As such — and given Nevada’s swingy nature — incumbent senators tend to try tokeep their distancefrom the top of the ticket. Then-Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) successfully distanced himself from GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, but then struggled in 2018 withhischangingpositionson then-President Donald Trump. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) embraced nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, and narrowly won her 2022 re-election while distancing herself fromthe White House(and while her GOP opponent, Adam Laxalt, closely aligned himself with Trump.) This cycle, the same playbook from 2022 and 2018 has applied — Rosen has at times kept the White House at arm’s length while embracing many of the party’s top policies, while Brown has tried to tie himself closely to the former president who heendorsedin January. “It's a strange dance,” Damore said of the trend of Nevada Republican Senate candidates embracing Trump. “You guys lost the state twice.” The dynamic is partially explained by polling. Rosen has run ahead of Biden and Harris all cycle, while Brown has consistently polled behind Trump. Polling averages show the presidential race in adead heatbutRosen aheadby an average of nearly 10 points. Party insiders and experts alike expect the margins to more closely resemble one another as the election approaches. In the meantime, Brown has championed much of Trump’s messaging, sending out mailers with pictures of the two of them highlighting Trump’s endorsement andsayingat a recent event that his first Senate priority would be to confirm Trump’s Cabinet officials, according to theNevada Current. Rosen has attempted to thread the needle. Herfirst adof the cycle, “Never Have,” focused on instances where she bucked her party, and she skipped the Democratic National Convention andavoidedBiden on the campaign trail in the days before he dropped out. Still, Rosen has shown up foradministrationand presidential campaign events, speaking at campaign rallies with Harrisbeforeandaftershe became the nominee. In ads, each Senate candidate and their allies have sought to tie the other to the presidential campaign. ARepublican adnoted how often Rosen voted with Biden, faulting both for higher prices, while a Rosenadcalled Brown “another MAGA extremist trying to cut Social Security and Medicare.” And in their fundraising appeals, Brown has attacked Rosen for her refusal to call on Biden to step down, saying she has “tepidly followed” her party leaders andnot pushed backon their border or economic policy, while Rosen has called Brown her “Trump-obsessedopponent.” Beyond the rhetoric, each candidate’s policy positions help sketch out where they align with Harris and Trump, respectively, and where there is ideological distance. Rosen Rosen’s record as one of the more moderate senators in Washington — she has ranked in the top 10 in theLugar Center’s Bipartisan Indexevery year since Democrats took the majority — reflects a legislative approach that includes breaking with her party on a handful of certain issues. During the two years they overlapped in the Senate, Rosen scored more moderate than current Vice President Harris. Voteview, which scores members of Congress’ partisanship through the votes they take,rankedHarris the second most liberal senator and Rosen the 31st in that time period. The Rosen campaign noted that the senator broke with Harris during the 116th Congress on 87 occasions, including on votes for Trump nominees such as secretary of defenseandsmall business administrator. An analysis fromFiveThirtyEightfound that Rosen hasvoted withPresident Joe Biden’s stated position about 98.6 percent of the time, with the number falling to 93 percent when judicial nominations are excluded. Throughout the current session of Congress, encompassing the past two years, VoteView found that Rosen voted with Senate Democrats 97 percent of the time; the median Senate Democrat stood at 98 percent. Rosen has broken with the Biden administration on several noteworthy occasions. In the waning days of 2022, with a government funding bill necessary, she and several other moderate Democratssupportedan amendment to restore a Trump-era immigration policy used during the pandemic to quickly turn migrants away at the Southern border. This year, she has bucked her party to vote tonullify police reformsin the District of Columbia, to overturn Biden administrationwater regulationsfor what land qualifies as a wetland andspoken outagainst the Biden administration’s recommendation that Congress impose a mining royalty. But on many of the key issues Harris is campaigning on — abortion and housing among them — Rosen is in alignment. Rosen supports Harris’ proposals to provide $25,000 in downpayment assistance to first-time homebuyers, expand the child tax credit and not raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000. While she has been an active advocate against consolidation in the grocery sector, includingopposingthe Kroger-Albertsons merger, her campaign said she is still studying Harris’ideato ban price gouging in the food industry. And much of her legislative accomplishments are the ones Harris is running on — including passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. And the two campaign organizations have ajoint fundraising platform, in which Rosen appeals to donors by saying Harris “has my full support as she works to defeat Donald Trump and make history.” In a debate-relatedfundraising appeal, Rosen blasted out a photo of her and Harris to supporters and said the two were “standing side-by-side in the fight of our lives to win this battleground state.” Brown A former volunteer on Trump’s 2020 campaign, Brown has name-checked Trump throughout his Senate campaign. In his fundraising appeals, hecallshimself an “the America First warrior that President Trump needs” andportraysthe Senate race as having the potential to make or break Trump’s ability to enact conservative policy if re-elected. He has toutedTrump’s endorsement(“In his first speech since the Butler, PA rally…Trump thought of ME?” one subject line reads) and pledged to “stand stronglybehind President Trump.” In media appearances, Brown has referred to Trump as his political inspiration. “President Trump and his leadership is what has driven me to try and join him in D.C. and help flip this seat,” hesaid onFox in April. On policy issues, Brown has embraced several Trump proposals, includingending taxeson tips and on Social Security benefits and cutting regulations and spending. Brown and Trump are optimistic about cryptocurrency, wanting to make thecountry(andNevada) a hub for the crypto industry. On education,eachhasadvocatedfor expanded school choice, federally guaranteeing families the opportunity to use public money to send their children to private schools. While Trump has called toaxthe Department of Education, Brown — whopreviously advocatedfor such a policy — said his approach would be to cut duplicative programs within the department’s budget. The Brown campaign did not respond when asked if he supported Trump’s plan to enact a10 percent tariffon all imports, to conduct the largestdeportation operationin American history orrescindunspent federal clean-energy funds. In a statement, his campaign reiterated his platform and promised to ""rescue Nevadans from the Biden-Harris-Rosen agenda.""

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-nevada-clean-energy-divides-the-senate-race,True,"This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. It is republished with permission. Sign up for their newsletterhere. In November’s election, Nevadans will vote between two U.S. Senate candidates with vastly different climate and energy positions—particularly regarding solar energy, an issue that has even divided climate and environmental advocates in the state. Incumbent Sen.Jacky Rosen(D-NV), Nevada’s junior senator, has consistently backed legislation supporting the renewable energy transition and pro-climate policies, like the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, and has fought against tariffs on imported solar panels. Her Republican opponent, Army veteranSam Brown, has said the construction of solar and wind farms across the state would ruin the state’s landscapes and is “not for the benefit of Nevadans,” while touting former President and current Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s “drill, baby, drill,” slogan in support ofpromotingdomestic oil and gas production. This election cycle, the Silver State is yet again a key battleground state, along with Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where Democrats hope to hold onto Senate seats in ultra-competitive races. A single loss would set up a divided and gridlocked government even if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the White House in November. Flipping the Senate would have major implications for passing legislation to address climate change. If Democrats lose both the White House and the Senate, meanwhile, it could allow Republicans to reverse the climate wins of the Biden administration, like the hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax credits delivered by the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump has vowed to repeal it if he’s elected. Also vulnerable would be rules from federal agenciespromotingthe use of public lands managed by the federal government for renewable energy development and conservation, which Republicans have pushed back on. Such rules are of huge importance in Nevada, the state with the highest proportion of federal public lands in the country. Polling has consistently shownRosen in the leadin the Senate race, with Harris alsoleading recent pollsin the state, though with smaller margins than the Democratic senator. “Nevada is leading the nation in building a robust clean energy economy, which is creating new good-paying jobs and lowering costs across my state,” Rosen said in a statement toInside Climate News. “While my extreme MAGA opponent Sam Brown would rather bash clean energy to score political points, I’m working to jumpstart Nevada’s energy future in areas like solar and geothermal so that we can continue this growth and improve people’s lives.” Brown fell short in the 2022 Republican primary for Senate in Nevada after moving to the state from Dallas in 2018 and has never held elected office. In speeches across the state, he has adopted an energy policy rebuking Rosen’s positions and focused his campaign on addressing inflation and highlighting his military service. In Afghanistan in 2008, hisHumvee struck a roadside bomb, leaving him permanently scarred. “We have solar fields being built across the state right now, on our land. Not for the benefit of Nevadans but for the energy policies of [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom,” BrowntoldKTVN 2 News Nevadalast yearin an interview announcing his campaign. “That power is going directly into California. We need someone who will be an advocate for us here.” Brown has previouslysaidhe would not have supported the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or the Inflation Reduction Act and hasproposed cutting federal agenciesthat cover the same issues as state agencies, like the Department of Energy. And he has been hammered on all sides for comments he made in 2022 about hiswillingness to allow nuclear wasteto be stored in Nevada’s Yucca Mountain—a third rail in Nevada politics for decades—but has since backtracked from that position. Brown’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Climate, environment and renewable energy advocates alike are supporting Rosen’s reelection bid, even though they sometimes fall on different sides of environmental fights within the state. “When the environment needed someone to stand up for it, very often Jacky Rosen was there,” said Patrick Donnelly, the Nevada political director for the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, the environmental group’s advocacy and political arm, noting his organization can often be at odds with the senator. Few states are seeing the impacts of climate change more profoundly than Nevada, with Las Vegas—where most of the state’s population lives—on track to have itshottest summer on record. The state has long been known as thedriest in the union, a fact that’s onlygrowing truerin recent decades, with the Southwest experiencing a megadrought and the city of Las Vegas having to impose drought mitigation measures years before other large cities in the region because of its limited water supply. Reno and Las Vegas are the fastest-warmingcitiesin the country, but both continue to grow rapidly in population. And in recent years, the state has seen record-breaking wildfire seasons. “Nevadans are feeling the brunt of climate change already and we can expect that to get subsequently worse in the years to come,” said Olivia Tanager, the director of the Sierra Club’s Toiyabe Chapter, as she watched smoke from nearby wildfires outside her home in Reno. “The heavy-hitting climate issues in the state are certainly at the top of most people’s radar.” One of the biggest issues Tanager hears every day from chapter members is the “nexus between conservation and solar,” with “a lot of members who are concerned about how rapidly solar is being deployed.” But, she said, Nevadans are already seeing the effects of “extreme heat, drought and wildfires and all of the other aspects of climate change, and so broadly recognized the need to transition away from fossil fuels. And a large portion of that is solar and solar deployment.” Rural stretches of the Mojave and Great Basin deserts are seeing a surge of proposals and construction of large solar farms, to take advantage of the region’s abundant sunshine and the chance to export solar energy to neighboring states. The industry is becoming a major driver of the state’s economy, which has the highest number of solar jobs per capita in the nation and is on track to have 28,000 jobs in the industry by 2028. That’s in large part because of the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, said Stephen Hamile, the chief operating officer of Sol-Up Solar and board member of the Nevada Solar Association. The legislation is allowing Nevadans to lower their energy costs, creating more jobs in the industry and giving the state the opportunity to export energy to other states. “Sam Brown is deeply opposed to solar energy development and would have been a major roadblock to major solar investments,” Hamile said. “If he is in [the Senate], unfortunately, he’s so divisive with regards to solar energy and [climate issues], you have basically a regressive energy policy that would ultimately harm Nevadans.” Nevada is also home to anew mining boom for lithium, the metal vital for creating the batteries needed for electric vehicles and storage of electricity from solar and wind farms. The state has the only operating lithium mine in the U.S., with others likely to come online in the coming years, despite being highly controversial for theirenvironmentalandcultural impacts. That’s because roughly 80 percent of Nevada’s land is public land overseen by the federal government, which has the final say on its best use—such as for mining or for solar farms. The Biden-Harris administration has consistently presented public lands overseen by the Interior Department as a vital part of the solution to climate change, providing the space needed for massive solar and wind farms, new mines for critical minerals like lithium and copper, conservation programs to offset carbon emissions and more experimental solutions like carbon storage projects and geothermal plants, which are also being proposed in Nevada. With its abundance of public lands, critical minerals and sunshine, Nevada is seeing firsthand both the drawbacks and benefits of the nation’s pivot away from fossil fuels—making the energy transition and climate change both critical issues in the state’s Senate race. At the local level, the surge of developments near rural communities can be divisive. The town of Beatty, two hours northwest of Las Vegas, is facing a surge of proposals for new gold andlithium mines, utility-scale solar operations and transmission lines to send the energy they generate to major urban areas. Erika Gerling, chair of the town’s advisory board, said the community has focused on developing its economy around recreation and ecotourism, given its clear skies, wide-open spaces and proximity to Death Valley National Park and Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge. She said residents and the board are worried about how the proposed projects will impact the local community and have opposed many of them. “We’re not against energy or solar in any way,” she said. “We are opposed to the location of these projects.” It’s an issue she could see influencing voters in rural places like hers, though the town itself does not weigh in on political matters. Environmentalists and clean energy advocates recognize the importance of addressing such concerns going forward. But they say Rosen recognizes those challenges, has worked with local communities on them before and is familiar with public-lands issues. Whether now or later, advocates say, Nevadans’ concerns over addressing climate impacts will likely outweigh some of the other concerns that make up Brown’s stance. “We aren’t looking to have solar fields in every spot in our backyard,” said Kristee Watson, executive director of the Nevada Conservation League. “But at the same time, if we don’t do this now, we’re not going to be able to support human life in this state.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-latinos-have-more-voting-power-than-ever-heres-what-that-means-for-2024,True,"For the more than 40 years he has lived in Nevada, Jose Solorio says political campaigns have never been quite able to truly crack the state’s Latino community. The 65-year-old lobbyist and community advocate is not the first to emphasize the well-worn bit of political wisdom that the Latino community is not a monolith, with voting behaviors differing greatly by their immigration experience, age and Spanish proficiency. But after all these years and close elections, he says political parties are still grappling with this dynamic. “Here's the thing: People want the Latino vote, but they don't know how to get it,” Solorio toldThe Nevada Independentat a Hispanics in Politics event this month. “We're different. We're not just ‘Do this, and you get all the votes.’ You have to reach us in different ways.” Despite hisanti-immigrant rhetoricand promise to launch amass deportation campaign, former President Donald Trump’s numbers with Latino voters haveremained steadythis cycle. While facing attacks for the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, Vice President Kamala Harris has continuedto consolidate supportfrom Latinos after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. It’s clear that any path to victory for Democrats and Republicans this November will require tapping into these voters — who make up about one in every five registered voters in the state. But just how politically powerful are Nevada Latinos, and has it always been this way? To answer these questions,The Nevada Independentanalyzed how population trends have changed among voting-age Latinos in Nevada, as well as the bloc’s voting behavior since 2008. The data shows that voting-age Latino population growth has outpaced overall population growth in Nevada — particularly in the Las Vegas Valley — while one prominent Census survey indicates that Latinos tend to register and vote at lower rates than Black and white voters, signifying their untapped electoral potential. The analysis also highlights a political environment where the power of Latino voters in Nevada is growing, a reality that could be the deciding factor in Nevada’s typically close statewide contests (the 2022 U.S. Senate race was decided by about 8,000 votes, the slimmest margin nationwide). And with Nevada’s six electoral votes potentially swinging the presidential race, political science experts say it’s possible the Latino vote in Nevada could play a significant role in determining the next president. As of earlier this month, Democratic groups and candidates have aired more than $17 million worth of Spanish-language ads in Nevada across the presidential and Senate races this cycle, while Republicans have spent about $2.5 million in the Senate race and $100,000 in the presidential, according to ad-tracking firmAdImpact. But it takes more than TV ads to court Latino voters, said David Damore, a UNLV political science professor who co-authored abookon the Latino population in Nevada. “You’re talking about months of door-to-door canvassing to engage voters, potential voters, to build their trust,” Damore said. “It's very time consuming work to do that, but this is what the Democrats started doing way back two decades ago, and that really paid off in the last decade, in moving Nevada from lean Republican to lean Democratic.” Fernando Romero remembers that he was one of the eight Latino students in his graduating UNLV class of nearly 450 people. As a university student more than 50 years ago, Romero says that Latinos faced rampant discrimination, which he described as “even worse” than his childhood in Texas. He was berated and felt isolated from his peers throughout his early years in Nevada. It was a change for Romero, who originally hails from El Paso, a Texas bordertown that has long had a majority Latino population. Romero, the longtime head of Hispanics in Politics, said that he didn’t see Nevada’s Latino community really boom until the late 1980s, when casino magnate Steve Wynn began developing the Mirage and various other hotels. The growing industry attracted many Latino families in search of work, but with no pre-existing Latino community, he says politically minded individuals such as him had to fight hard to make their presence known — and it hasn't always been successful. “We've grown considerably,” Romero said. “But the thing is that politically, we have not grown in the same leaps and bounds.” The data backs him up. The number of voting-age Latinos in Nevada has grown considerably in recent years, outpacing the nationwide rate of growth for Latinos, according to aNevada Independentanalysis of Census data. It’s especially pronounced in Clark County, the state’s population center. In 2022, more than 23 percent of the county’s voting-age residents were Latino, up from about 14 percent in 2009. Take the maps below as examples. In 2010, Latino-dominant Census tracts — small geographical areas used for data collection — were mostly concentrated in East Las Vegas, and only six of the roughly 650 Las Vegas Valley tracts were majority Latino. 2022 is a different story. There were more than six times as many majority-Latino Census tracts compared to 2010, and the 2022 map has a slightly redder hue, indicating the growth of the Hispanic population throughout the valley. Lisa Sanchez, a political science professor at the University of Arizona, said there are likely two main factors driving this trend: migration patterns within the U.S. and youth “aging up” to voting age. “There's that old statistic that says, every 30 seconds, a Latino voter becomes eligible to vote because they reach their 18th birthday. That's absolutely true,” Sanchez said. “Latinos have slightly higher birth rates, so it's a younger population, and they're coming to have more children, and those children are becoming voters.” While the state’s Latino population has grown, its level of representation in elected office (despite bright spots like the election of the nation’s first Latina Senator in Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV)) has also lagged behind. In 2021, Latino groupspushed to securea majority Latino congressional seat during the redistricting process. But the new boundaries ended up dividing the Latino population across the state's four districts, diluting the voting bloc's power. While at the Hispanics in Politics event, Norma Salgado, a 60-year-old government worker, toldThe Nevada Independentthat she’s encouraged by this population growth. As a young girl, her Mexican immigrant father encouraged Salgado to take pride in her heritage and become politically active. Despite this, Salgado said she felt isolated, recalling at times seeing only one other Hispanic student in her classroom. Now, seeing the groups of Hispanic kids graduating from high school and college fill her with pride. “It’s up to us to raise up other Hispanic people,” Salgado said. So how does all of this translate at the ballot box? In every presidential election since 2008, Latinos in Nevada have voted and registered at lower rates than Black and white voters, according to a prominent Census survey taken after every federal election. Since 2008, about 70 percent of eligible Latino voters in Nevada reported registering to vote and half reported casting ballots in the presidential election, according to the Census’ Current Population Survey, which surveys thousands of Nevadans after presidential elections. Meanwhile, about 80 percent of white Nevadans reported registering to vote and 65 percent voting during that time frame, while two-thirds of Black Nevadans reported voting while 83 percent reported registering. Asian voters often reported participating at similar rates as Latinos. Sanchez from the University of Arizona said this data follows historical trends. “Latinos are punching under their weight class,” Sanchez said. “They tend to not turn out to vote at the rates that we see for other groups, especially whites and Blacks in the United States, that's nationally speaking and historically speaking.” However, there remains untapped potential among Latino voters in part because they are younger and tend to have more volatile voting behaviors, Sanchez said. An analysis by the Latino Data Hub at UCLAfound thatthe median age for eligible Latino voters in Nevada was 37 — 10 years younger than the average among all racial groups. Sanchez said this translates into voting behaviors, with younger people more inclined to vote if a presidential ticket is energizing voters and has tapped into social media platforms preferred by younger voters, such as TikTok. “Before Kamala Harris came in, we definitely saw sort of the everyday format of campaigning being the primary role, and people weren't energized,” Sanchez said. “We're definitely seeing these massive numbers of Latinos become more energized recently.” Latino populations have also soared in other swing states. Of the seven swing states most likely to determine the winner of this year’s presidential race, Nevada ranked third in growth of voting age Latinos, following North Carolina and Georgia. In addition, four of the 10 most populous counties in those swing states more than doubled their Latino voting-age population from 2009 to 2022, with Clark County slotting in third. The data reflects the increasing power of Latino voters in all swing states — even those not known for prominent Latino populations. Sanchez said these population changes have the potential to “shake things up” electorally. For example, Georgia and North Carolina are historically known for having predominant white and Black populations — and that has not changed — but the rise of the Latino population could have seismic electoral effects, particularly when elections have razor-thin margins. “When you're talking about the swing states that are deciding [elections] by 8,000 votes, like Nevada, it's going to become even more important,” Sanchez said. “[Parties] are really focusing on which ones of these votes we can shift over to our camp.” Clickherefor more information about The Nevada Independent’s analysis for this story.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-how-question-7-would-require-voter-id-in-nevada,True,"After years of Republican-led pushes to implement voter ID laws in Nevada, the question will be posed to voters this November. Voter ID is among the many election-related policies that have pitted Democrats against Republicans nationwide for years. Republicans have argued it is a necessary measure to ensure election security, while Democrats have said it could disenfranchise voters who do not have a form of identification. Whilepollinghas shown wide support for establishing a voter ID requirement, Nevada isone of 14 statesto not require a form of identification while voting, and instead relies on voters’ signatures to verify their identity, but ID is required to register to vote. Read below for more information on the implications of the ballot question and the history of the debate in the Silver State. Summary of what it does:Theproposalwould amend the Nevada Constitution to require all in-person voters in Nevada to present a valid photo identification — such as a driver’s license, passport, student ID card or concealed weapon permit — before voting. It would also require those voting by mail to include part of a personally identifiable number — such as their driver’s license number or Social Security number — alongside their signature. If a majority of voters support the question this year, it would be placed on the 2026 ballot, when another affirmative vote would change Nevada’s Constitution. How did we get here?:Repair the Vote, a PAC led by former Clark County GOP Chair David Gibbs, filed the petition for the ballot question last November. A group of well-known Democratic-linked attorneys quicklysuedto block the question on the grounds that its description of effect (a 200-word summary of the measure included on signature forms) failed to outline its full implications. The suit also argued that the measure would require a funding source without providing one, and that it was akin to anunconstitutional poll taxbecause most of the identification options require some kind of payment. A Carson City judgedismissedthe lawsuit in February, and the state Supreme Courtupheld that rulingin April, determining that questions regarding a poll tax should not be addressed before the election. In July, the initiativequalifiedfor the November ballot after election officials verified 131,590 valid signatures and passed the threshold of signatures needed from each of the state’s four congressional districts (25,591). This is the second attempt at a voter ID ballot question by Repair the Vote. In 2022, a judgeblockeda question on the grounds that its description of effect was argumentative. The ruling came too late for the group to amend the question’s language and gather enough signatures. Abilllast year pushed by Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, would have established voter ID in Nevada, but itnever received a hearingin the Democratic-controlled Legislature. What have other states done?:Nine states have enacted strict photo ID laws for voting, according to theNational Conference of State Legislatures. Three states have voter ID requirements but do not require a photo and instead accept documents such as bank statements. Twenty-four other states have some form of a voter ID law, but they are less strict and have exceptions, such as signing an affidavit of identity or having poll workers vouch for a voter’s identity. The arguments in favor:Proponents of voter ID say it increases election security and would help rebuild trust in elections. They also say that ID is required for actions such as buying alcohol, seeing a doctor and applying for college — and that elections should be no different. Supporters are also quick to refer to the widespread popularity of voter ID laws (aNevada Independentpoll last yearfound74 percent of respondents in favor, with just 8 percent opposed) and a 2008studythat found the laws had no effect on voter turnout. The arguments against:Opponents of voter ID laws say it would make it harder to vote and could amount to disenfranchisement. They argue that voter impersonation isessentially nonexistentin the U.S. and that the law would particularly affect voters in rural areas and tribal communities because of the long distance to DMV offices. A 2022studyby University of California, Berkeley researchers found Black and Latino voters were most affected by voter ID laws in Texas. Primary funders:Repair the Vote hasreceivedmore than $300,000 since launching the ballot initiative, mostly from a Virginia-based group called Civic Voter Engagement ($157,000) and Allen Knudson, a Henderson resident who gave $100,000 in January. The Las Vegas Sands, whose largest shareholder is GOP megadonor Miriam Adelson, also has financially supported the effort. The Better Nevada PAC, which is linked to Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, created an offshoot PAC called the Better Nevada Ballot Advocacy Committee (now known as the Nevada Voter ID Coalition, which is chaired by Lombardo) to raise money for the initiative. Las Vegas Sands made a $1.5 million contribution to the Better Nevada PAC earlier this year, which then transferred $1.4 million to the offshoot PAC. Battle Born Progress — a progressive group —launched a PAClast month called the Nevada Voter Freedom Alliance to oppose the initiative. Financial impact:The secretary of state’s office estimated that the initiative would cost the state $6,750 to change processes related to voter check-in and verification of mail ballots, and modify the state’s voter registration system to ensure all necessary data is captured. The Legislature’s Fiscal Analysis Division also assumed that the state or local governments would incur costs by making the accepted IDs free (to avoid a poll tax). It is unclear how many voters this would apply to and which agencies would be responsible, meaning the full financial impact is unknown.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-defends-debate-performance-at-vegas-rally-vows-to-free-up-federally-owned-land,True,"Former President Donald Trump returned to Las Vegas on Friday to highlight proposed economic policies in a speech meant to woo swing state Nevadans, but spent much of his time repeating falsehoods and bemoaning this week's presidential debate. In a freewheeling late evening speech lasting more than 80 minutes, Trump spoke to more than 6,000 people, according to his campaign (that grewnoticeablysmaller as he spoke) at the World Market Center in downtown Las Vegas, delivering his usual rhetoric against illegal immigration — this time complete with internet memes blown up on screens beside and behind him — and once again predicting that a victory for his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would mark the undoing of America. Most of his speech was a typical Trump affair that haphazardly weaved political points on immigration and the economy with myriad tangents, such as a back-and-forth with the crowd about the best nickname for President Joe Biden, as well as criticizing his treatment at Tuesday’s debate by theABCmoderators who fact-checked him in real time. He said Harris was “clearly not well” — accompanied by videos of her laughing — and called her “a threat to democracy.” But it was at the end of the speech where he made another new Nevada specific pledge: To “open up large portions of land” that he said will foster the development of new housing, a reference to thebipartisan pushto free up federal land for affordable housing development. The federal governmentowns about 85.9 percentof the land in the state, limiting their development and use. However, he also said these opened up public lands will have “ultra low regulations,” a vague promise that does not reflect what hasbeen included in Nevada lands billsthat have stalled in Congress. He also linked the opening of land to a pledge to grow the state’s film industry with the help of Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, though that policy is likely to be addressed on the state level,as has been proposed through tax credits. “We’re going to open up that land to you, you’ll be able to build studio lots and everything else,” Trump said. He also touted a trio of economic proposals —no taxes on Social Security benefits, overtime pay and tipped wages, the last of which he originally pitched in Las Vegas during a June rally. Harris made the same pledge at aVegas rally of her own last month, while Trump highlighted theproposalin his most recent appearance in the Silver State last month — his second visit to Nevada in three weeks. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), also held a rally herelast month, and Sam Brown, the Republican candidate for Nevada’s U.S. Senate seat, was brought onstage at both that event and Friday’s rally. Trump’s emphasis on Nevada is no accident —polls showTrump and Harris in a dead heat in the state, whose six electoral votes could prove crucial in determining the winner of the election. Trump and his allies have said in multiple appearances that if he is victorious in Nevada, he will regain the presidency. Despite the close polling, attendees of Friday’s rally interviewed byThe Nevada Independentsaid they weren’t worried about November and believed the only way Trump could lose is by cheating. “I think he's gonna do it, but also I think the Democrats got to figure out some way to f--- him out of it,” said Kerry Denman, a 65-year-old maintenance director at an aviation company. “That's just American politics now.” The debate Trump kicked off his speech praising his Tuesday debate performance, although he has sincerefused a rematchoffered by Harris. ACNNpolltaken immediately after the debate found 63 percent of respondents believing Harris had performed better. Screens next to Trump shared clips of the debate, and he condemned moderators for not fact-checking his opponent while demanding that moderator andABCanchor David Muir owed him an apology. On a projector above him, he played clips of Harris’ giving different stances on fracking, health care and the mandatory buyback of assault weapons — echoing a debate question Harris was asked Tuesday about her shifting policies. “She tried to gaslight people about her radical left positions,” Trump said. Moderators also fact-checked Trump on a host of statements made, some of which Trump reiterated Friday, including that some states allow the killing of babies after they are born (which is not true). “They were wrong, and Trump was right,” he said about the moderators. He also repeated afalse conspiracy theorythat Harris was wearing an earpiece during the debate to feed her answers. Jim Cardello, 56, said at Friday’s rally that he was dismayed by the overall tenor of the debate, saying Trump could have shown more humility and that it did nothing to alleviate political divisions in the country. “That certainly did nothing to let either side feel like you're working together,” Cardello said. The border In his speech, Trump delivered his standard anti-immigration rhetoric, but with an added twist: memes. As he condemned the increase in illegal border crossings, an image of tattooed Latino men was projected above him, with text saying they would be people’s apartment managers under a Harris administration. Later, another image projected above him showing a man with a knife following a woman captioned “No one is safe with Kamala’s open border.” He also derisively referred to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, though he did not repeatthe unsubstantiated claimhe made at the debate that they are eating people’s cats and dogs. Wayne Allyn Root, a far-right Nevada radio host, however, did echo this conspiracy earlier in the night, and Trump said earlier Monday that he would deport Haitian migrants in the community “back to Venezuela.”. He referred tonews reportsof a Venezuelan gang’s increased reach in the U.S. and said, without providing evidence, that some undocumented immigrants are being flown into the U.S. on “beautiful jet planes.” Trump has faced criticism from Democrats for urging Senate Republicans tokill a bipartisan immigration billthat would have increased the number of border patrol agents and given the Biden administration the authority to “close” the border — or cease processing most asylum claims — if the number of migrant encounters reaches a certain threshold. He also said, without evidence, that hundreds of millions of people would enter the U.S. illegally if Harris were elected president, and that “our country will be obliterated” Raquel Lara, a 55-year-old Las Vegas teacher, said the border was among the issues most important to her, citing stories she has heard about migrants hurting children. She was among the attendees who, like Trump, underscored the stakes of the election — not just in regards to the border — which she thinks will be a “landslide.” If Trump doesn’t win, Lara said, it’s going to “be war.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/on-the-record-senate-district-5-candidates-carrie-buck-and-jennifer-atlas,True,"As Democrats attempt to gain their first two-thirds Senate supermajority this century, Southern Nevada’s Senate District 5 is one of the few districts the party hopes to flip blue this election cycle. The swing district covering portions of Henderson and Paradise is represented bySen. Carrie Buck(R-Henderson) and has a fairly even split of registered Democratic (29 percent) and Republican voters (29 percent), with the highest percentage of voters registered as nonpartisans (34 percent). Buck, who has a background in administrative education, moved to Las Vegas in the 1990s and serves as the president of the Pinecrest Foundation, a registered nonprofit that helps fund charter school educational initiatives including scholarships for students. She’s seeking re-election to a district she narrowly won in 2020 but had its boundaries shift after the 2021 redistricting process. Her Democratic challenger,Jennifer Atlas, came to Southern Nevada almost 18 years ago as a competitive ballroom dancer and then worked in hospitality before eventually transitioning into lobbying. She no longer works as a lobbyist and is a paralegal for the Coburn and Martin law firm. In separate long-ranging interviews withThe Nevada Independent,Buck and Atlas addressed their goals for office and answered questions across 14 different policy areas. Buck has faced attacks by Democrats for being the only Senate Republican to not pass any bills she sponsored during the2021and2023legislative sessions (when Democrats controlled both chambers). Buck defended her record, noting that the majority party can unilaterally kill bills, and hervoting recordshows she broke with her party more often than any other Republican state lawmaker in 2023, including being one of two Republicans to support protections for an out-of-state abortion seeker bill. Atlas, meanwhile, hasbeen criticizedby Republicans for her past lobbying clients, such as Acadia Healthcare, a company whose subsidiaries have faced several scandals, including a for-profit psychiatric facility in Utah it owned that was sued for cases of sexual abuse. The company latershut down the facility. Altas has pointed out that she only worked on behalf of Acadia Healthcare’s Nevada-based facilities, which were not involved in any scandals, and did not interact or have relationships with the organizations that had issues in other states. She said in past interviews withThe Nevada Independentthat her role in lobbying was primarily as a researcher. She defended her record and views her past experience as a benefit that will allow her to “go to work on day one.” She said she is running for the seat because of her 9-year-old son and a desire to improve schools, through efforts such as reducing the number of long-term substitute teachers and large class sizes. Below, we explore Atlas and Buck’s views on a variety of key legislative issues.Click herefor the full list of questions we asked each candidate and their edited responses. Education School choice Health care Elections Housing Firearm policies Criminal justice reform Tax credits Reproductive rights Education Buck said many Nevada schools have had a one-star rating for more than a decade. She’d like to see a policy that allows the state to change a failing school’s governance that could address root causes. Buck didn’t directly address a question about bringing Nevada’s per-pupil funding in line with national averages, but said the state already made a historic investment in education last session and more accountability is needed. “You can throw billions more money at the Clark County School District, it’s not going to end up where it makes a difference,” Buck said. If she had the power to make a specific policy change in the education realm, Atlas said it would be to ensure “there's a qualified teacher in every classroom that's getting paid like the professional that they are,” and students are in appropriately sized classes. “We have to make sure that we improve outcomes for everyone,” Atlas said. “So whether that's through funding or other measures, it's something we have to continue to work on.” The topic of free school meals has becomea political lightning rodafter Gov. Joe Lombardovetoeda bill last session that would have continued the universal program, citing the large number of students already eligible for free meals and a desire to get back to pre-pandemic normals. Buck said providing universal school lunches is expensive for the state, and families who can afford it should be able to pay for their own lunch. “All the ones that absolutely need to be fed are getting fed,” Buck said. “It’s a political thing to say that we’re not feeding kids, and that’s absolutely a lie.” Atlas said there can be a stigma surrounding children who get a free or reduced-price lunch. She said some families who may not qualify for free or reduced-price lunch may also struggle to provide lunch for their children, and she “cannot wait” to support providing funding for universal free school meals. “We have to make sure we're taking care of our kids,” she said. “That shouldn’t be political.” School choice Buck said she supports providing state funding for school choice options arguing that the state may end up paying less than it would for the child to go to a public or charter school. States such asArizonaandFloridathat have adopted universal school choice programs with no income limits have racked up massive budgetary costs, though Nevada’s Opportunity Scholarship program has limited enrollment and an income limit of up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Atlas said students shouldn’t need to attend a private school to receive an excellent education, and the state’s education funding should ensure that public schools are fully funded first. She criticized Lombardo’s administration for awarding money to a scholarship organization that gave Opportunity Scholarships to new students before ensuring those already in the system were funded. Atlas said that decision exhibited a “lack of transparency and fiscal mismanagement.” She did not answer a question about whether students who currently receive Opportunity Scholarships should be able to keep them. Health care Both candidates agreed that greater access to health care is needed and the state should take steps to address theprovider shortage. Buck suggested raising Medicaid rates for services, or the rates doctors are reimbursed for low-income patients who are on the state-managed publicly funded insurance program. Atlas wants to ensure that people can afford prescriptions and plans to bring a bill that would automatically enroll babies who qualify for Medicaid in the government-funded health insurance program. Atlas said she believes that the state can expand on previous policies to require more transparency on the price of insulin and asthma medication. Buck voted against a bill in 2023 that would have the state adopt drug prices negotiated by Medicare (the measure was vetoed by Lombardo). Legislative Democratsplan to reintroducethe measure in 2025, but Buck indicated she’s still opposed. “Anytime you put caps on things, I really worry about … the greater impact,” Buck said. Elections Buck said she would support the voter ID initiative (Ballot Question 7) on the ballot, saying it would help prevent noncitizens from voting. Atlas said voter ID policies have proven to disenfranchise older voters and voters of color. “I do not believe we should be amending the Constitution in a way that could result in less participation and folks being left on the sideline,” Atlas said. After losing the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump and his supportersfalsely claimedmassive fraud had taken place, including viathe practice of “ballot harvesting.” Buck said she and other Republicans won races that year, proving there was not widespread fraud in Nevada’s election system. Asked abouther 2021 social media postaccusing Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria of lying about not receiving ballots from 1,500 deceased voters that year, Buck said she received the list from the Republican Party and was trying to verify it. “I was given this list, and so I asked the question,” Buck said. “Making sure that we do a thorough process is all that I'm trying to get to the bottom of.” Buck said those who collect and turn in ballots should have to report more information to the state. She said with a mail-in option, there’s no need for anyone to be going around collecting ballots. Atlas disagreed. “So-called ‘ballot harvesting’ is a MAGA talking point adopted by Donald Trump and his allies to sow doubt in our elections and disenfranchise voters,” she said. Housing Buck said the Legislature needs to address the issue of unaffordable home insurance, and added that the government needs to find ways to ensure that when it comes to home prices, “we have a lot of options up and down the price point for families.” Atlas said sheappreciatedthat the Legislature set aside $200 million for a homelessness fund to service Clark County last year, and believes there are opportunities to expand that type of support. Buck, whose husband owns a rental property, said she wouldn’t support removing the state’suniqueandoften criticizedsummaryeviction law, because it might make renting out houses a riskier business and lead to decreased inventory. “Anytime that you don't go with (a) free market, you lessen inventory, and people don't want to invest here or build here,” Buck said. Atlas did not say whether she supported changing the policy. Firearm policies As a concealed carry permit holder, Buck said she has a right to protect herself and she is “never going to vote yes on an infringement of that right.” She called school shootings “heartbreaking,” and suggested legalizing concealed carry for school officials could help address safety issues. “When you have an area that says ‘no gun,’ it's just a bull's eye,” Buck said. Atlas said gun violence in schools is one of her greatest fears as a mom, but she did not answer a question about whether she supports a state ban of semi-automatic or assault weapons, but said she would support common-sense reforms to address gun violence. “When we look at mass shootings in this country when an assault weapon is used, it is six times more deadly,” Atlas said. “I truly believe we can find a way to protect our kids while balancing the rights of gun owners.” Criminal justice reform In 2023, lawmakerslowered the quantity of fentanylpossession needed to trigger atraffickingcharge, though the change was less harsh than a competing proposal by Lombardo to raise criminal penalties for possession in any amount. Buck said she believes criminal penalties for fentanyl possession should be higher and supports lowering the current possession thresholds. “I know several people who have lost their kids to fentanyl,” Buck said. “Higher criminal penalties would be [an] appropriate remedy to disincentivize the abuse and the trafficking.” Atlas applauded Attorney General Aaron Ford and Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas), both Democrats, “for taking bold action to go after fentanyl traffickers and increase penalties.” She did not say what specific changes to the state’s fentanyl possession laws she would support. “Because the fentanyl crisis is a national problem, it will require national solutions,” Atlas said. “I look forward to working with legislators from other states and at the federal level, so Nevada can adopt best practices.” Tax credits Buck said tax credits and incentives should only be granted if Nevadans benefit as a whole. She said she would consider that before voting on a tax credit program, such as theproposed expansionof the film tax credit program. Atlas said she would need to review any tax credit legislation before she decided to support it. She noted, however, that an expansion of film tax credits could be an opportunity to diversify the state’s economy and create jobs. “But it has to make sense for the state,” Atlas said. “If the numbers add up that we can generate more revenue for our schools, for our health care system than we put out, then it's absolutely something worth exploring.” Reproductive rights Buck said she would support legislation protecting in vitro fertilization (IVF) but would leave the decision to change or expand Nevada’s existing abortion protections to voters. Atlas said she will vote for Question 6, the ballot measure seeking to enshrine existing abortion protections into the Nevada Constitution, and would support a broader abortion rights initiative that will return to the Legislature in 2025 (that Buckvoted against). “I'm a strong supporter and endorser of reproductive freedom,” Atlas said. “I want to protect our rights to birth control and IVF, and that's exactly what that initiative will do.” Asked whether they believed Nevada Medicaid shouldcover abortion services, Atlas demurred and Buck said she does not support the agency doing so except in cases of rape, incest or threat to the pregnant person’s life. “Abortion procedures outside of those instances are considered more of an elective procedure, so they should not be the burden of a taxpayer,” Buck said. Buck said she believes that the state should fund crisis pregnancy centers, or nonprofit organizations that provide counseling and other prenatal services from an anti-abortion perspective. They’ve beencriticizedfornot referring women for abortion proceduresand some havepromoted debunked theoriesthat the procedure can contribute to future infertility or breast cancer. The centers offer “life-saving care,” Buck said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-nevada-latinos-backing-harris-but-margin-with-trump-closer-than-in-2020,True,"Vice President Kamala Harris now holds a 23 percentage point lead over former President Donald Trump among registered Hispanic voters in Nevada, according to a new poll released Thursday by Latino advocacy nonprofit UnidosUS. The poll found that Nevada Latinos significantly trust Democrats on priority issues such as the economy and health care over Republicans. The poll found that only 34 percent of Nevada Latinos support Trump, echoingother pollsthat have found Harris is winning over Nevada's Latinos, now almost in line with President Joe Biden’s26 percentage point leadwith the state’s Latinos in the 2020 election, according to exit polls. Back in 2020, another UnidosUS poll showed Bidenwon 75 percent of Nevada Latinos— indicating a much tighter margin this time around. Polling for the state’s U.S. Senate race also remains consistent. UnidosUS found 55 percent of Latinos support Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) compared to the 24 percent in favor of Republican candidate Sam Brown. “Nevada represents much more than just its six electoral college votes,” Rafael Collazo, director of political affairs at UnidosUS, said during a Thursday press conference. “Latino voters in Nevada will determine who wins the White House, the U.S. Senate and who controls Congress.” Making up roughly 1 in 5 of the state’s eligible voters, Latino voters are a crucial voting bloc in the state. As the presidential campaign has entered its final months, Harris and Trump have ramped up efforts to woo Nevada Latinos, making direct overtures to the Culinary Union Local 226, of which54 percent of the members identifyas Latino, and making campaign stops in majority Latino neighborhoods. The poll surveyed 2,800 eligible Latino voters across eight battleground states, including Nevada, from Aug. 5 to 23. Three hundred of those respondents were in Nevada. The poll was conducted via 25 percent via live calls and 75 percent via web-to-text in English and Spanish. The margin of error was 1.8 percent for the whole eight state survey, and 5.7 percent for Nevada. As in other states, Latinos in Nevada are most concerned about economic issues, principally inflation, the economy and health care costs, according to the poll. It also found that an overwhelming number of Latinos support continued abortion access (70 percent to 22 percent). The survey also found that 61 percent of Nevada Latinos “strongly support” raising the minimum wage for all workers, and that 59 percent want “adequate school funding.” Despite the demographic making up a sizable chunk of the state's electorate, 53 percent of poll respondents said that they have not been contacted by a political campaign. For those contacted, 25 percent said Democratic candidates reached out to them and 14 percent said they were contacted by Republicans. The voter registration gap is one of the “greatest opportunities” for candidates, noted Clarissa Martinez, vice president of the UnidosUS Latino Vote Initiative. More than 20 percent of Latinos in Nevada will be voting in their first presidential election this year, and 37 percent of the state’s Latino population is new since the 2016 election, representing a great opportunity for outreach, said Martinez. But even if support doesn’t increase, last montha reportfrom the polling firm Equis found Democrats have “some wiggle room.” “Minimize the impact of the Latino Nevada community at your own peril,” Collazo said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-campaign-sues-nevada-over-alleged-noncitizen-voting,True,"Donald Trump’s campaign and other GOP groups have filed a lawsuit alleging that Nevada fails to remove noncitizens from its voter rolls — Republicans’ fourth lawsuit challenging the state’s electoral procedures this year. In thenew lawsuitfiled in Carson City District Court on Thursday, the Trump campaign, Nevada GOP, Republican National Committee and a Clark County voter are accusing Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar of improper list maintenance and failing to investigate if registered voters are noncitizens. They allege that the state has not adopted any regulations to verify that people on the voter rolls are citizens or that the state systemically removed noncitizens from the voter rolls, therefore violating their duties. Republicans, they argue, are seeing their votes diluted by that system, and therefore are asking the court to require the state to address the issue through more aggressive list maintenance. The Democratic National Committee and the Nevada Democratic Party are named in the suit as defendants as well (citing arulingin an election law case earlier this year requiring political parties seeking relief that would affect their opponent to include the other major political party in the suit). Republicans’ prior three lawsuits in Nevada — challenging the length of time thatmail ballotscan be received,voter roll maintenancepractices and thecounting of mail ballotswith unclear postmarks — have been dismissed or denied, though all are in various stages of appeal. No state, including Nevada,permitsnoncitizens to vote in federal elections — doing so is a crime punishable by fine and prison time, and those found guilty can face deportation or changes to their immigration status. An analysis from the conservative Heritage Foundation found only24 casesof such voter fraud since 2003, none in Nevada. In a statement toThe Nevada Independent, the secretary of state's office noted that noncitizen voting is already illegal. ""There are already numerous safeguards in place to prevent noncitizens, or anyone ineligible to vote, from casting a ballot,"" it said. ""Any claims of a widespread problem are false and only create distrust in our elections."" The Trump campaign’s lawsuit claims that thousands of noncitizens were on the voter rolls in December 2020, “many of whom cast a ballot.” The suit acknowledges that such reports of electoral fraud weredismissedby Republican then-Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. At the time, the Nevada Republican Party compared lists of people who presented immigration documents to obtain licenses at the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles with the statewide registration list to identify potential noncitizens. In investigating those claims, the secretary of state’s reportconcludedthat there were about 4,000 people who voted in 2020 and had presented an immigration document at the DMV, but that more than 40,000 immigrants had naturalized in Nevada during the prior four years. The report found no evidence of foreign nationals voting and said that “generalized information acquired from DMV cannot serve as a basis for an investigation into alleged voter fraud.” But the lawsuit argues that Cegavske’s conclusions were insufficient and based on an incorrect understanding of prior Supreme Court cases. Further, the campaign claims that a biannual survey from Harvard University’sCooperative Election Studyincluded a number of noncitizen respondents who claimed in the poll that they are registered to vote — and that the rate is higher in Nevada (4 percent) than the national average (about 2.5 percent). And Republicans also cite public records finding that about 8 percent of the prospective jury pool in Washoe County District Court claimed disqualification because they were noncitizens — and that jury pools are in part compiled through voter registration lists. ""Nevada’s elections should be a reflection of its citizens’ voices, not influenced by non-citizens who have no legal standing to participate,” Nevada GOP chairman Michael McDonald, who served asa fake electorin the 2020 effort to overturn the election results in Nevada, said in a statement. “Any efforts to allow non-citizens to vote threatens the very foundation of our elections and diminishes the power of lawful voters across our state.” The lawsuit notes that other states have removed noncitizens from the voter rolls, including Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbottclaimedto have purged 6,500 noncitizens in late August. Many election experts caution that these cases often mischaracterize routine voter maintenance, and that the so-called noncitizen removals are typically people who have beenerroneously identifiedas noncitizens, and are often recently naturalized citizens. Despite alack of evidencethat noncitizen voter fraud is occurring in Nevada, Republicans allege that not only is noncitizen voting a problem, but that it “favors Democratic candidates and harms Republican candidates.” The plaintiffs are asking for the state to step in and require Aguilar to verify that all registered voters are U.S. citizens, suggesting that the state use citizenship verification programs. House Republicans have promoted a similar argument,passing a billin July to mandate that prospective voters provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote — such a law was struck down in Arizona as a violation of the Voting Rights Act, because citizenship can often bedifficult to prove, including for college students and other transient populations. The Kamala Harris campaign and Democrats havearguedin court filings that Republicans’ lawsuits are a public effort to sow doubt in the election before it begins, regardless of the outcomes of the cases. The Trump campaignfiled a barrageof election litigation challenging results in 2020. Despite losing 59 of 60 cases, the unproven allegations of electoral fraud have stuck — about 30 percent of Americans, perpolling, do not trust the government to properly certify elections.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-nevadans-support-efforts-to-address-social-security-shortfall,True,"Bipartisan majorities of Nevadans support raising taxes and/or cutting benefits to maintain the solvency of Social Security — defying conventional wisdom that changes to the popular retirement program are politically unthinkable. Eighty-three percent of Nevadans say they have a positive view of Social Security, according to a newpoll. But the beloved entitlement program faces a longevity challenge — its trustees project that its fund will becomeexhaustedby 2033, at which point beneficiaries will see a reduction as much as 21 percent in their monthly payments without any changes. The poll was conducted by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy and is one of several issue-focused polls the group is conducting ahead of the election in swing states. This survey polled 604 Nevadans in online opt-in panels from Aug. 2-17, and has a margin of error of 4.5 percent. Dr. Steven Kull, a political psychologist at the University of Maryland and director of the Program for Public Consultation, said that when polled directly, majorities of voters say they do not want to see the retirement age raised or payroll taxes increase — often convincing politicians that the topic is an untouchable third rail. But when voters went through the policymaking simulation in this poll, in which they were given context about the impending shortfall, presented with arguments and given the choice of what size of a change they would like to make (including keeping the status quo), they were much more willing to do things that are facially unpopular. “They're able to deal with it,” Kull said. “You don't have simply Republicans want[ing] to cut benefits and Democrats want[ing] to increase taxes. There is this natural convergence.” Support for varying types of Social Security policy changes is not reflected among the candidates in the presidential race. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have eachadvocatedagainst cutting benefits or raising the retirement age; Democratic proposals in Congress have focused onraisingthe income cap for payroll taxes and increasing benefits, while Republican ones identify raising the retirement age for younger people and phasing out benefits for high earners still far from retirement. Nevadans polled were presented with four potential solutions to the shortfall: Nevadans were slightly more convinced by arguments against solutions that required cutting benefits — raising the retirement age or means-testing Social Security benefits. Even so, they were still willing to make modest cuts. Eighty-eight percent of Nevadans — including equal majorities in each party — said they were willing to gradually raise the retirement age to 68 by 2033 in order to reduce the shortfall by 15 percent. And 91 percent of Nevadans supported reducing benefits to the upper 20 percent of earners, with near even support among Republicans and Democrats. In each case, support dwindled as the proposed benefit cut got harsher. Only 19 percent were willing to cut benefits for the top half of earners, and only 20 percent were comfortable raising the retirement age to 70. Support did not vary much across age and income brackets for the more modest proposals, while it started to differ for the more aggressive ones. Eighty-eight percent of Nevadans earning more than $150,000 in annual income supported reducing benefits for the top 20 percent of earners compared to 92 percent of those making less than $50,000 — but that 4 percent difference widened to 19 percentage points when asked if benefits should be reduced for the top 40 percent of earners. “When people deal with public policy issues, sometimes there's a little bit of a self-interested effect, but it's not very strong,” Kull said. “They generally think about what's needed. They put on their lawmaker hat.” A similar scenario played out when Nevadans were asked about revenue raisers. When asked about a proposal to make wages over $400,000 taxable as well (Social Security payroll tax is only applied to income up to $169,000), 87 percent of Nevadans, including 81 percent of Republicans, agreed. And 85 percent of Nevadans supported raising the Social Security payroll tax rate from its current 6.2 percent rate to 6.5 percent during a six-year period. Again, support dropped off as the tax hikes became more aggressive. A 6.9 percent tax rate was supported by 52 percent of Nevadans, while a 7.2 percent tax rate garnered the support of just 41 percent. Social Security’s solvency could also be partially addressed by increasing the program’s revenue through expanding the tax base — such as through increased immigration — or raising incomes, though the poll did not address these more nebulous policy aims. While Nevadans want to see the Social Security shortfall addressed — and are willing to pay more in taxes and raise the retirement age to do so — they also want to see the benefit’s floor increased. Though each proposal would increase the shortfall, 73 percent of Nevadans want to see the minimum monthly benefit for those who worked more than 30 years raised from $1,066 to $1,570, while 68 percent of Nevadans want the cost-of-living adjustment formula changed to increase the amount retirees receive. People younger than 29 were most supportive of raising the minimum monthly benefit (80 percent), while retirees already collecting Social Security were the least convinced (62 percent). Nevadans also believe Social Security payments should be raised for people older than 85 — two-thirds of Nevadans would support an $100 monthly increase for the so-called “oldest of the old.” Social Security, a traditional area of political strength for Democrats — President Franklin D. Roosevelt (D) created the program in 1935 during the New Deal era — has regularly come up on the campaign trail, particularly in Nevada’s Senate race and Congressional District 3. There, Democrats have criticized Republican congressional hopeful Drew Johnson, a tax analyst, for public statementssupportingraising the retirement age. In an interview in June, Johnsonsaidhe now believes the shortfall can be addressed without doing so by auditing the Social Security Disability Insurance rolls and cutting government spending elsewhere. The issue has come up in the Senate race as well, with Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) claiming her Republican challenger Sam Brownembraceda plan to sunset the entitlement. The Brown campaign has said he is against cuts to Social Security. Brown and Trump have also pledged to end federal taxation of Social Security benefits, without saying how the loss of revenue would be made up. Democrats in Nevada have campaigned againstraisingthe retirement age orprivatizingSocial Security.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/walz-continues-nevada-trip-with-vegas-fundraiser-coffee-shop-visit,True,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz held a fundraiser and visited a coffee shop Tuesday morning during his first solo trip to Las Vegas since becoming the Democratic nominee for vice president. Walz spoke to a group of about 50 donors for about 15 minutes at a fundraiser hosted at a condominium complex near the Las Vegas Strip by Chris Grove, a sports betting industry investor and executive. He underscored the stakes of the election, previewed Tuesday night’s presidential debate and contrasted the outreach efforts and visions of both presidential campaigns. Later, he visited the TIABI Coffee & Waffle shop alongside his daughter, Hope, where he spoke briefly with the shop owner and several supporters. He did not take questions from the media at either event. Walz’s visit was his first to Las Vegas since his hugerallywith Vice President Kamala Harris last month at Thomas & Mack Center, and his second stop in Nevada in as many days aftertouring the areanear the Davis Fire in Reno on Monday. It came as part of a multistate tour in swing states and took place hours before Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to square off in their first presidential debate. Nevada is among the handful of states that could decide the results of the presidential race, andpolls showHarris and Trump in a dead heat. Walz began his remarks at the fundraiser by reflecting on Monday’s stop in Reno by commending the “neighborliness” of community members and first responders, a term he has used often since joining the Democratic ticket. He also lauded Democratic organizers for shifting plans for his scheduled rally because of the fire. “You don't win elections to bank political capital to win another election. You win elections to burn political capital to improve people's lives,” Walz said. “To see folks out there pivot on a dime to say, ‘Look, we've got a big election coming up, it's super important, but right now, my neighbors are in need, and I'm going to be there for them.’” He also briefly discussed some goals of a Harris-Walz administration, including creating an “opportunity economy,” bringing back abortion protections established underRoe v. Wadeand pursuing climate change policies. Republicans have criticized the campaign for not sufficiently outlining their policy proposals, though the campaign releaseda policy pageon its website this week. “There's a lot of folks in the middle,” Walz said. “We have a responsibility to tell [people] about what we're going to do.” He also defended his pandemic policies as Minnesota governor — which Republicans have criticized as being too stringent — and criticized Trump for his continued election denialism and indications that he willonce again challengethe results of this year’s election if he loses. He said that consistent organizing could help run up the score against Trump and make it harder to challenge the results. “The victory becomes too big for them to do their nonsense,” Walz said. “They will, by the way, they will continue to do that, but we'll have the capacity to be able to push back on every single one.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-unveils-new-top-down-voter-registration-and-election-management-system,True,"Nevada election officials announced the implementation of a new voter-registration and election management system last week that they said will speed up the state’s release of election results and reduce voter registration errors. Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat, and Washoe County Registrar of Voters Cari Ann Burgess showed reporters the new system and its processes Wednesday. Every county will use the program in the 2024 November general election, though Clark County, which implemented the program before the 2024 election cycle, will merge its voter registration database with the state in 2025. “Nevada runs some of the most safe, secure and accessible elections in the country,” Aguilar said. “[This system] only enhances those safeguards and increases our transparency.” Previously, the state operated under a bottom-up approach with each county having its own processes for registering voters, running elections and reporting results — leading to delays, inefficiencies and other errors such as acoding problemthat led to inaccurate online voter history records after the February presidential primary. Aguilar attributed past issues to the fact that each county operated its election apparatus separately. Now, without requiring each county to transfer data to the state and then have the state compile it, officials “eliminated the opportunity for error that existed in the previous systems.” Under the new top-down system, formally known as the Voter Registration & Election Management Solution (VREMS), every county will use the same election management processes and one centralized statewide voter registration database. The program's implementation was required through a law approved in the 2021 legislative session. The system was originally supposed to go live by January 2024, but implementation wasdelayed. Last year, the Legislature approved $30 million to help implement VREMS before the 2024 general election. Though the voter registration program is centralized, the process for tabulating ballots is completely separate from the state and will continue to operate in a decentralized manner. Aguilar said that decentralization will help maintain security and allow for county-level control over those processes. Security and transparency As Nevada is one of the most transient states in the country, Aguilar said the new program will allow officials to update voter rolls more quickly and accurately than in the past and immediately track if a voter moves from one county to another. He added that a new digitized check-in process will offer a more seamless voting experience. Messaging about how to register and vote will be more consistent, he said, and with counties all using the same system, state officials will be better able to provide counties with hands-on support. “A lot of this boils down to security and transparency,” Aguilar said, noting that the new program will also allow for unified data reports getting as specific as the precinct level, offering officials the ability to immediately check a voter’s history, ensure no one is double voting and more quickly know if a voter needs to verify his or her signature. Burgess, who said she used a similar system while she was working in Minnesota elections, described the new program as “coming full circle.” “It is very safe, secure and we’re going to be absolutely amazed this year of how fast and how easy it is for our poll workers to do,” she said, referencing the use of new digital devices called “poll pads” to help check in voters who are casting a ballot. Though there are less than two months until Election Day, Aguilar said he’s not worried. The state has already invested resources to train county elections teams and officials will continue to practice using the new program in the coming weeks, he said.“We know how important the Nevada vote is. We are a purple state. We are a battleground state. We are a swing state,” Aguilar said. “We have to make sure Nevada votes count.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/walz-tours-reno-wildfire-command-site-after-canceling-rally,True,"Democratic vice presidential hopeful Tim Walz postponed a planned Monday evening rally in Reno after a massive wildfire south of the city launched Northern Nevada into a state of emergency and prompted the evacuation of thousands. Instead, the governor stopped by the Democratic Party of Washoe County headquarters, where volunteers had collected pet food, diapers, water and other supplies for displaced victims of the uncontained Davis Fire, which sparked Saturday at a regional park in Washoe Valley and has grown to about 10 square miles and required about 20,000 people to evacuate, including parts of South Reno. “The local, the state and the federal work hand in hand. It is really critical you’ve got partners working together,” Walz said. “The biggest thing is protection of life. And then a family loses their home, and it truly is a home, not a house, we know that is very challenging.” Though the rally didn’t happen as planned, Walz told visitors at the headquarters that he appreciated the efforts of first responders and the campaign “has an opportunity to come back again.” Walz then toured an incident command center at Galena High School, bringing pizza to first responders and visiting with local officials. Walz left Reno to attend a campaign fundraiser in Las Vegas on Tuesday. His visit to Nevada is part of a multistate swing of battleground states to drum up support for Democrats ahead of Tuesday night’s debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardovisitedthe site earlier in the day. During the nearly two-and-a-half-hour Reno visit, Walz made time to speak with Aaron Sims, the chair of the state’s rural Democratic caucus whose family home was burned in the fire. Though the Nevada GOP criticized the visit as a“political ploy” and a waste of resources, Sims said the presence of Walz showed a level of care that’s often lacking in politics. “Instead of canceling the entire trip, he chose to come out here. He could have gone to a different state last minute. They could have pulled together 10,000 people, probably in Arizona or something, and had a rally out there,” Sims said. “He decided to tour the fire area — to me, that speaks volumes.” As of Monday evening, the Davis wildfire had burned at least 14 structures and was 0 percent contained. Classes were canceled almost districtwide in the Washoe County School District on Monday, and nine additional schools near the fire will remain closed Tuesday. Conditions are expected to worsen Tuesday when a red flag warning goes into effect for the region, indicating that low humidity, high wind speeds and rising temperatures increase wildfire risk. When the plane carrying the governor landed, billowing clouds of smoke covered the horizon. At the incident command center in South Reno, the air quality monitoring service Purple Air showed an index of 156, an “unhealthy” rating where people may start to experience negative health effects. While Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill, a Democrat, visited the command center and later had a conversation with Walz, flakes of ash fell from the sky. Hill toldThe Nevada Independentthat with more than 600 firefighters on the ground, resources have poured into the region from nearby states, including Idaho, Utah and Oregon. The county is working through regional and federal requirements to ensure it can get resources to address its needs, she said. Hill added that she thought it was great that Walz saw the situation in person. She said he equated it to the floods Minnesota experiences and said it was vital to ensure efforts to address climate disasters are funded. Though insurance isn’t an immediate need right now, Hill said she brought up the rising costs of fire insurance rates and families who aren’t able to get coverage for their homes. “Insurance rates, fire insurance rates, are going to skyrocket … and it's going to make it unable for people to carry a mortgage,” Hill said. “We need to really talk about how we can support … the insurance piece, future policies and he was very open to that.” Hill also spoke with Walz about the county’s plans to seek legislation at the state level to give the insurance commissioner more support in ensuring home protection for residents. “We’re just dealing with bigger disasters in our communities, and it takes all of us coming together to find the solutions and support each other,” Hill said. “I’m glad he took the time to see what’s happening on the ground.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/a-pro-trump-restaurant-owner-may-explain-the-former-presidents-appeal-to-nevada-latinos,True,"When the Secret Service appeared at his restaurant, Javier Barajas couldn’t quite believe it. It was a Sunday morning and about 15 men had just walked into his newest restaurant, Il Toro E La Capra — a Mexican-Italian fusion spot in Spring Valley — asking if former President Donald Trump could host an event there the next week. “I thought ‘Oh my God, I forgot to write down a reservation for sure,’” Barajas, 65, recalled. That Friday, about 50 guestscrammed into Barajas’ restaurantto hear the former president speak on his economic agenda and attempt to woo service workers with his no taxes on tips proposal. There, Barajas endorsed Trump, won over by his economic messaging and what he calls his “nice but strict” personality. In an interview last week withThe Nevada Independent,Barajas said he’s felt increasingly alienated from the Democratic establishment and finds Trump’s candidness and economic messaging refreshing. He says Democrats such as President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama (who he voted for) delivered empty promises to immigrants such as himself, promising to create more pathways toward legal residency but failing to actually do so. Barajas is a clear example of shifting dynamics within Nevada’s Latino population — a demographic that makes up nearly 1 in 5 voters in the crucial swing state. Trump’s bombastic rhetoric on immigration and pledges to massively deport undocumented persons appear to not have affected his relative popularity among Latinos —2020 exit pollsshowed him doing better with Nevada Latinos than past GOP presidential candidates. Eating into Democrats’ historic level of support with Nevada Latinos helps explain why Nevada remains squarely in the toss-up category on the presidential level, and why Nevada Democrats have been eager to court Latino voters, opening field offices in areas where the majority of residents are Latinos and expanding outreach efforts. For Barajas, support for Trump also comes down to personal touch. In July, President Joe Biden visited Barajas’ restaurant, the Original Lindo Michoacan, as part of his final campaign trip (cut short by apositive COVID diagnosis) beforedropping out of the race. Barajas said Biden didn’t even speak to him, while Trump talked to him for about 10 minutes after his August event. Before he left, Trump promised to visit his restaurant again, Barajas says. Despite now mounting calls to boycott his restaurant for hosting Trump, Barajashas stood firmon his political beliefs, including in an interview on“Fox and Friends.” Since he arrived in Las Vegas more than 40 years ago, Barajas’ restaurants have become Las Vegas staples. Lindo Michoacan has beendubbedas having some of the best Mexican food in the city, and now has four locations: Desert Inn, Summerlin, Henderson and one in Downtown Las Vegas. But Barajas said he’s speaking out about his support for Trump now because rising inflation and economic conditions will probably force his business to substantially downsize. “If we keep going like this, I'd probably have to close all restaurants and probably keep one. I would have to fire 450 people. We need change,” Barajas said. Coming to Las Vegas Barajas never intended to come to Nevada. Originally from Michoacán, a verdant state in Central Mexico, Barajas grew up working in his father’s grocery store — an “old-fashioned” place with only one of each item. He enrolled in seminary, but after the economy got tough in the late ’70s, Barajas made plans to work in California with his uncle to send money back home. As the two were crossing the border, they were separated when caught by immigration authorities. After that, Barajas remembers finding himself outside a gas station in Downtown Las Vegas, crying and nervous. “I don’t even know how I got here,” he said. In Vegas, Barajas picked up a variety of odd jobs. First a stint at a “terrible car wash,” then as a dishwasher and gradually working his way up to chef. He describes those early years as difficult, not knowing English and nervous to talk to people. He was an unauthorized resident until the late 1980s and was granted legal status after Ronald Reagan — whom he calls his hero — signed theImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which granted amnesty and a path to legal status for more than 3 million undocumented people. Hebecamea U.S. citizen in 1992. For most of his early life, Barajas' love of cooking was a secret, apprehensive about how it would be received in a “macho culture.” At seminary, he watched the nuns cook and picked up their tricks. Working in Vegas restaurants, he noticed that Mexican food consisted mostly of tacos and burritos (which he had never even heard of). After members of the staff walked out at one restaurant, he stepped in to help in the kitchen. “I was a secret chef,” he said. More than 13 years later, Barajas opened his own restaurant, a cramped place with six tables and the only bathroom across the kitchen. To source some of his ingredients, he would go to Oaxaca, Mexico. “It was my dream to open my own restaurant,” Barajas recalled. Today, Il Toro e La Capra is adorned with gilded columns, lampshades and paintings Barajas had delivered from Italy. He owns five restaurants across Las Vegas and says he employs more than 500 people. Barajas’ brothers have also opened up their own restaurant franchise: El Bonito Michoacan. ‘We want to be able to make a life’ Barajas admits that things have been tough lately. Inflation and the pandemic put new financial strains on his businesses, each of which he estimates pay about $100,000 in payroll every two weeks. Asinkhole forcedone of his restaurants to temporarily close in 2020 and, in 2021, one of his children, son Javier Crescencio Barajas, who inherited Barajas’ love of cooking, died. Still, Barajas says that his businesses were all performing far better under the Trump administration. As someone who has been both an employee and an owner of a restaurant, he believes that the “No Tax on Tips” will be greatly beneficial. Trump’s proposal to launch mass deportations doesn’t fluster Barajas, who said that Trump told him that he won’t deport “hardworking” immigrants such as himself. If anything, he thinks Trump is more candid than Democrats such as Obama who “promised a lot,” butwhose administration ended up deportingmore people than any other president in history. Barajas isn’t alone in his beliefs. About 44 percent of Nevada Latinos believe that Trump will “bring safety to our border and solve the immigration crisis,” according torecent pollingfrom the media firm Entravision.Multiple surveysshow that many Latinos (such as Barajas) have increasingly warmed to more stringent immigration measures, finding the current system unfair. Obama, Barajas says, was particularly disappointing. Two of his brothers were hoping his administration would open a pathway for them to become legal citizens (the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill in 2013 that was thenblockedby House Republicans), but he still blames Obama, who “didn’t do anything.” Despite the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an executive action that protects some eligible immigrants who arrived as children from deportation, some of his friends’ children still don’t have legal residency — a fact that causes Barajas despair. “I want the people who really work to have the opportunity to legalize their status. The people that have been here for years and years, I want to give them the opportunity,” he said. Trump, he believes, will accomplish these legal pathways — a belief that runs counter to what Trump has promised in his campaign. On top of his pledge to launch mass deportations, Trump has proposedending birthright citizenshipand cracked down on visa renewals during his term. Project 2025 — The Heritage Foundation’s playbook for Trump’s second term — has called for a crackdown on temporary work visas and other avenues for employment authorization such as the H-1B program, which allows employers to petition for“highly educated"" foreign professionals. While Harris has not fully fleshed out her immigration policy, she’s also saidshe’ll crack down on illegal immigration. She said she will take a “pragmatic approach”and will push the U.S. Senate to pass a bill that would stop processing asylum claims if migrant encounters reached a certain threshold. Barajas ultimately believes the former president recognizes just how essential immigrants are to America and its labor force — that without immigrants the country wouldn’t run. Trump, he says,  told him he has Latinos working for him himself and promised only to deport “bad people.” “We want the economy to be fair. We want to be able to make a life. We want to live good,” Barajas said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-what-question-6-would-mean-for-abortion-rights-in-nevada,True,"For the first time in more than 30 years, abortion will be on the ballot for Nevada voters through a question to establish a state constitutional right to an abortion. In 1990, Nevadansoverwhelmingly approveda referendum that legalized abortion through 24 weeks into a pregnancy, a process that ensured any changes to the law would have to be done through the ballot. This Silver State law came into new focus after the U.S. Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wadetwo years ago, ending federal protections for abortion and allowing Republican-led states to outlaw the procedure. The overturning ofRoehas prompted a push by Democrats to shore up abortion rights state by state through ballot questions, andvoters in 10 stateswill vote in November whether to bolster abortion protections. Read below for more details on the ballot question, its implications and how we got to this point. Summary of what it does:Theproposed amendment to the state Constitutionwould protect the right to an abortion until fetal viability, which is generally considered about 23 or 24 weeks, or when necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient. Even though these protections are essentially the same as what is legal under Nevada law, a state constitutional right to an abortion would be harder to overturn. Because this is the first time that voters will weigh in on the ballot question, it must also be approved in the 2026 election for the Constitution to be amended. How did we get here?:Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, the group behind the ballot initiative, initially began its efforts to qualify an abortion rights question last September through a broader constitutional amendment.In addition to a constitutional right to an abortion, this proposal would have covered procedures such as vasectomies as well as infertility and prenatal care. In October, a new PAC called the Coalition for Parents and Childrensued to blockthe effort. The lawsuit said the petition violated the single-subject rule for constitutional amendments and would carry an unfunded mandate “to fund a board to review whether abortions or reproductive services were performed pursuant to standard of care.” In November, Carson City District Court Judge James Russellruledthat the initiative violated the single-subject rule and carried an unfunded mandate, prohibiting supporters from gathering signatures to qualify for the ballot. Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court and pivoted to a more narrowly tailoredballot questionsolely focused on abortion rights. This question faced another legal challenge on the grounds that it misled voters because abortion is already legal, but it received approval from Russell, a decision that has also been appealed and is still pending before the state Supreme Court. In April, the state Supreme CourtoverturnedRussell’s dismissal of the broader abortion rights ballot question. But because petition supporters were prohibited from gathering signatures after the judge’s order, they moved forward on the narrower question on abortion. In June, the abortion questionqualifiedfor the ballot after county election officials verified more than 127,000 signatures in support of the initiative. The Legislature also passed its ownconstitutional amendmentlast year to guarantee “a fundamental right to reproductive freedom.” The measure must be approved again in the 2025 legislative session to qualify for the 2026 general election ballot. What have other states done?:Abortion-related ballot questionswill appearon ballots in nine other states this year. All of these questions would protect abortion access, except for Nebraska, where signatures have been submitted for two measures: one to protect abortion access and another to curtail it. Pro-abortion ballot efforts have seen success across the country sinceRoewas overturned. Four states — California, Michigan, Ohio and Vermont — have established constitutional rights to reproductive freedom. In Kansas and Kentucky, voters also rejected anti-abortion questions. The arguments in favor:Supporters of the ballot initiative say every step should be taken to shore up abortion rights afterRoewas overturned. Thanks to the 1990 referendum, the right to an abortion through 24 weeks into a pregnancy can only be overturned by a one-time majority vote of the people. However, if the right is enshrined in the state Constitution, it would require majority votes in two consecutive elections, or the passage of legislation in two straight sessions, followed by a one-time majority vote of the people. Supporters have also argued the ballot initiative gives greater protections to doctors who provide abortions and keeps families in charge of their health care decisions, rather than politicians. The arguments against:Opponents of the initiative — including the anti-abortion group Nevada Right to Life —have arguedthat it misleads voters by not disclosing that approving the question would not change the state of abortion rights in Nevada. Opponents have argued it would cost taxpayer funds and make the state’s abortion laws more complicated. Primary funders:Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom has raised more than $4.6 million as of the end of June, much of which came from “dark money” groups, which are nonprofits that do not have to disclose their donors because they are not primarily political groups. The Nevada Alliance, aprominent Nevada-based dark money group, has given more than $1 million to the group. Two national dark money heavyweights, theTides FoundationandSixteen Thirty Fund, also gave more than $1 million combined to support the ballot question. Think Big America, a nonprofit connected to Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, has also given more than $1 million to back the effort. Guardians of the Young, a PAC opposing the ballot initiative, was registered in August and has not reported any money raised. Financial impact:Both sides disagree about the financial impact. The legal challenges to the initiative have argued that the question would create an unfunded mandate, which are provisions that implicitly require a funding source without such money being allocated. The latest appeal to the state Supreme Court argued that the state would be forced to cover the costs of abortions if the initiative passes because failing to do so would infringe on a person’s constitutional rights. Supporters of the initiative have said this argument “is entirely based on a wildly speculative argument regarding abortion-related funding.” The Legislature’s Fiscal Analysis Divisionsaidthe financial impact “cannot be determined with reasonable degree of certainty.” This is because the passage of the amendment may result in  legislation changes to comply with the amendment’s provisions, but it is unclear which current laws may have to be changed.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/green-party-will-not-appear-on-nevada-presidential-ballot-state-supreme-court-rules,True,"The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that the Green Party is ineligible to appear on the state’s presidential ballot after its petition failed to include the required language for minor parties to qualify for the ballot. In a 5-2 ruling released Friday, the high court’s majority agreed with lawyers representing the state Democratic Party — which filed the lawsuit — that the minor party’s petition contained the wrong affidavit language, invalidating the signatures gathered to land on the ballot. The legally deficient language used by the party was recommended by the secretary of state’s office, which led dissenting Justices Kristina Pickering and Douglas Herndon to write that they believe the ruling violates the Green Party’s due process rights. The decision reverses a lower court’s rulingthat allowedthe Green Party to qualify for the Nevada ballot for the first time since 2008. It is also a victory for state Democrats and ensures that only Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver will appear as a third-party candidate on Nevada’s presidential ballot after independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race last month. Democrats in multiple states have sued to keep the Green Party off the ballot, fearing dissatisfied left-leaning voters would not vote Democratic if the Green Party was an option. Jill Stein, the Green Party’s presidential candidate, has received around 1 percent of the vote in Nevada,polls show. In a statement, co-chair of the Nevada Green Party Margery Hanson did not address the ruling but said “I live in a swing state and I will not be voting this cycle.” Hilary Barrett, the executive director of the Nevada Democratic Party, said in a statement that the “ruling is a victory for Nevada voters and ensures that the Green Party plays by the same rules as other campaigns.” The Democratic Party hadamendedits original lawsuit because the affidavits signed by circulators included the language for initiative petitions to qualify for the ballot, not minor political parties, which omits a sentence stating the circulator believes all signees were registered voters in the county they reside. However, the affidavit language used by the party is the same as the one recommended by the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office in itsguidefor minor political parties to qualify for the ballot. The high court’s majority ruled that this error by the state did not absolve the Green Party’s legal obligation to use the right form. “The Green Party's failure to use the correct circulator affidavit cannot be excused by the Green Party's reliance on the sample petition received from the Secretary,” the opinion states. In their dissent, Pickering and Herndon were “deeply concerned that our decision today excuses an egregious error by the Secretary of State's office that will result in a significant injustice.” In a statement, the secretary of state’s office said providing “accurate information to the public is a priority for our office, and we will continue to review and improve all guides and documentation.” “The Secretary of State's office was involved in this case by necessity, and took no position on the legal sufficiency of the petition under Nevada law,” the statement said. “We respect the decision of the Justices, and are working with the counties to ensure the decision is carried out.” The high court’s majority reversed the initial decision by Carson City District Court Judge Kristin Luis and found that she had erred by determining that the Green Party had substantially complied with the requirements for circulator affidavits. “[T]he declarations provided by some of the Green Party's circulators … do not indicate that the circulators were asking signatories if they were a registered voter in the county of the signatory’s residence,” the ruling said. The dissent disagreed, saying that the majority’s view of substantial compliance was “too expansive” and that the declarations made by the Green Party were sufficient to show compliance with state rules.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/political-fight-over-nevada-voter-id-question-likely-to-heat-up-after-new-groups-formed,True,"Two new groups have formed on opposite sides of theNevada voter ID ballot question, heating up the political fight about an issue likely to be among the most competitive questions on the 2024 ballot. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo announced Thursday that he will be chairing a group called the Nevada Voter ID Coalition focused on passing the ballot question that would require voters to provide proof of their identities when voting either via mail or in-person. Meanwhile, Battle Born Progress — a progressive group — launched a PAC called the Nevada Voter Freedom Alliance opposing the initiative. Both PACswereregisteredlast month with the secretary of state’s office, but had not been publicized until Thursday. The announcements of the new PACs — exactly two months before Election Day — indicate that the partisan fight over voter ID will heat up in the home stretch of this election cycle. If a majority of voters support the question this year, it would be placed on the 2026 ballot, when another affirmative vote would amend Nevada’s Constitution. Until last month, the pro-voter ID group was named the Better Nevada Ballot Advocacy Committee, a PAC created earlier this year that was an offshoot of the pro-Lombardo Better Nevada PAC. The Las Vegas Sands has been aprominent donorto the voter ID effort, making a $1.5 million contribution to the Better Nevada PAC earlier this year, which then transferred $1.4 million to the offshoot PAC. The co-chairs of the newly named group are Sparks City Attorney Wes Duncan, real estate agent Tina Brown and businessman Tim Cashman, according to Thursday’s announcement. An official with the PAC declined to comment on what its campaign strategy would look like. Lombardo had tried to pass a bill requiring voter ID last year, but itstalledin the Democratic-controlled Legislature, leading the Republican governor to say Thursday that he “made a promise to voters that if the legislature would not support the will of the people, I would take the vote directly to them.” The Nevada Voter Freedom Alliance is hoping to “prevent the passage of undue burdens on Nevada voters,” according to itsregistration form, and plans to invest in digital and radio advertising, said Shelbie Swartz, the group’s secretary and the executive director of Battle Born Progress. Its announcement Thursday included support from officials affiliated with Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund and the Native Voters Alliance Nevada. “It is nothing more than a calculated effort to silence thousands of eligible Nevadans, especially seniors, people of color, rural voters, students, and low-income communities,” Swartz said in a statement. About the ballot question Theproposal— brought by a separate group led by former Clark County GOP Chair David Gibbs — would amend the Nevada Constitution to require all in-person voters in Nevada to present a valid photo identification (such as a driver’s license, passport, student ID card or concealed weapon permit) before voting. It would also require those voting by mail to include part of a personally identifiable number — such as their driver’s license or Social Security number — alongside their signature. Thirty-six other stateshave some form of voter ID laws, and the measure has bipartisan support in Nevada — aNevada Independentpoll last yearfound74 percent of respondents in favor, with just 8 percent opposed. Proponents say voter ID increases election security and would help rebuild trust in elections. Opponents of the measure say it would make it harder to vote and could amount to disenfranchisement, particularly affecting voters in rural areas and tribal communities because of the long distance to DMV offices. A 2022studyby University of California, Berkeley researchers found Black and Latino voters were most affected by voter ID laws in Texas, while voter impersonation isextremely rarein the U.S. A group of Democratic-linked attorneyssuedto block the voter ID effort last year — arguing its description was inadequate and that the costs of IDs mean the proposal is akin to anunconstitutional poll tax— but the suit failed indistrict courtand thestate Supreme Court.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-latinos-more-likely-to-vote-than-swing-state-peers,True,"More than 50 percent of Nevada Latinos voted during the 2020 election, the second highest rate among swing states but still significantly trailing white voters, according to new research from the University of Southern California’s Center for Inclusive Democracy. The report released last week found that Nevada’s 408,000 Latinos voters made up about 20 percent of the eligible voters in 2020, but represented only 15 percent of those who actually cast a ballot. With about 77 percent of Nevada voters casting a ballot in 2020, turnout was at least 50 percent higher among white voters compared to people of color. Nye and Storey counties had the highest percentage of Latino turnout that year, with the more populated Clark and Washoe counties lagging behind. Only Florida, with a 58 percent Latino turnout in 2020, had a higher rate than Nevada among swing states, according to USC. Michigan had the lowest, with only 33 percent of Latinos voting that same cycle. Looking ahead to the 2024 election, efforts to boost turnout rates for Nevada Latinos may prove key to the aspirations of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, both of whom are working to attract Latino support. Harris has helpedconsolidateLatino support in Nevada after replacing President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket, while Trump has made overtures to members of the Culinary Union Local 226 andtouted his proposalto end taxes on tips. Recent polling fromFox Newsindicatedthat Harris is winning Nevada Latinos by 13 percent over Trump, well behind Biden’s 26 percentage point lead with those voters in the 2020 election — a finding backed up by otherrecentpolls. Despite turning out at a higher rate than other swing states, Nevada’s Latino population still votes significantly less than white voters, especially as voters tend to skew younger and identify as independent — demographic traits that suggest a greater population of “low-propensity"" voters. In 2020, at least six states saw a lower presidential race margin of victory than the number of eligible Latinos who did not vote. Part of the problem is that campaigns will “parachute into” highly competitive states such as Nevada before the election, but often fail to make “deep contact” with communities, Mindy Romero, director of the USC Center for Inclusive Democracy, said in an interview. For more sustained Latino mobilization, Romero said she believes there needs to be more funding for “on-the-ground” community organizations that can form longer-term connections with voters. These groups, however, “don't have the resources to meet the scale of need,” Romero said. With many operating as nonprofits, they often rely on donations and government funding to get by. Campaigns often rely on something called “likely voter models,” Romero noted, to determine which constituents to reach out to. These “likely voters,” however,tendto be overwhelmingly white and make higher incomes, meaning that the electoral impact of people of color and those who are less affluent may beunderestimated. The Harris campaign toldThe Nevada Independentthat it has launched new Nevada field offices in areas where the majority of residents are Latino, using these spaces to host community service and cultural events, such as bilingual financial literacy workshops and family movie nights. The campaign says it launched these efforts in March, months before Biden dropped out of the race. The Trump campaign did not respond for comment. The USC research found that turnout rates aren’t just lower among Latinos. Only about 47 percent of Black voters in Nevada participated in the 2020 election, while 37 percent of Asian Americans did. But their turnout rates and overall population has been growing. Between 2016 and 2020, the number of Black and Latino voters in Nevada increased by more than one-third, with turnout rates growing by 6.7 percentage points among Black voters and 4.5 percentage points among Latinos, according to USC. Asian Americans in Nevada saw a turnout increase of more than 10 percentage points. “If investment and mobilization were to occur, then so many more Latinos and voters of color would have a larger, more representative say in the electorate,” Romero said. To compile the research, USC used voter files and publicly available eligible voter estimates from the U.S Census Bureau and from the political data vendor Catalist.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/brown-says-hes-not-for-changing-our-existing-law-on-abortion-ballot-measure,True,"Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown, who has declined to say publicly how he would vote on an abortion ballot question, said last week that he was not in favor of changing the law. Nevadans will vote this fall on aballot measureto add protections for abortion rights to the state’s Constitution. Abortion is already legal in Nevada through 24 weeks of pregnancy and, because it was approved in a 1990 ballot referendum, is only reversible through another vote of the people. In audio obtained byThe Nevada Independent, Brown, asked about where he stood on the ballot measure, indicated skepticism about the ballot question. “I'm not for changing our existing law,” Brown said in the clip taken at a campaign meet and greet in Las Vegas on Aug. 28. “Our existing law has been in place for over 34 years. The ballot measure would change the law and essentially [create] no limit on access to abortion.” Brown then said that the constitutional amendment would allow abortion up to 40 weeks — but did not answer a follow-up question on if he would suggest voting against it. If passed, the ballot amendment would protect the right to an abortion through “fetal viability” — considered to be near the 24-week mark — or when necessary to “protect the life or health of the pregnant patient.” It would apply the same standard that current Nevada law protects, with the only difference being that a constitutional amendment would be more difficult to overturn. Republicans have argued that the ballot amendment is redundant and misleading for a state that already has protected abortion rights. And groups such asNevada Right to Life, an anti-abortion organization, have argued that the fetal viability standard could be changed by doctors, who they claim have a financial incentive to do so. That has not occurred in several other states — from red states such as Montana and Wyoming to blue states such as California and Washington — whose law sets the “fetal viability”standard. Brownconsiders himselfpro-life — with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother — but has said he respects the will of Nevada voters and would not vote for a national abortion ban if elected. “I believe that we as voters should set the law around abortion,” Brown said in acampaign video. “In fact, our law has been in place for over 30 years, and no politician can change that.” Brown’s abortion stance has been a point of heavy scrutiny from his opponent, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Democrats, whohighlightedhis past support of a 20-week abortion ban in Texas during a 2014 state legislative run. If elected, Brownsaidhe would vote to confirm federal judges that “understand the importance of protecting life” and vote against bills that incorporate federal funding for abortion, abortions without parental notification or so-called “late-term abortions” — rare instances unavailable in most states in which abortions are performed beyond 21 weeks due to medical concerns. His campaign declined to comment on how he will vote on the ballot measure — a tack he haspreviouslytaken.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-nevada-voters-want-expanded-birth-control-access-oppose-abortion-criminalization,True,"As a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the Nevada Constitution goes before voters in November, a new poll shows Silver State residents oppose criminalizing the procedure. According to a survey conducted in Spanish and English by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy, more than 80 percent of Nevada voters across both major parties said they do not want to criminalize abortion before a fetus is generally considered able to survive outside the womb with support (about 24 weeks). That includes 69 percent of Republicans and 90 percent of Democrats. About 70 percent of Nevada respondents said they oppose criminalizing abortion at any stage of pregnancy. Pollster Steven Kull, a political psychologist at the University of Maryland and director of the Program for Public Consultation, said in an interview that the survey, which provides briefings and arguments for and against certain policies, centered on questions government officials are considering, which led to the focus on criminalization. “We want to zero in on what the government would do,” he said. “The government doesn’t ‘allow abortion,’ it doesn’t put out a sign that says, ‘We hereby endorse abortion.’ The real lever in the picture is to punish the doctor or the woman through criminalization.” Polls ahead of the 2022election showed abortion was one of the top issues motivating Nevada voters to cast their ballots. Democrats made abortion one of thefocal pointsof the state’s U.S. Senate race that year. U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-NV) campaign hammered her Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, on abortion, and his campaign responded with attacks centered on the economy. Cortez Masto won the election byless than 1 percentage point. Nevadastate lawhas protected abortion up to 24 weeks for more than 30 years, which could only be overturned by a direct majority vote from the people. Nevada’s lawmakers and governor have no power to restrict abortion access earlier than that time frame. The University of Maryland’s poll indicates that 78 percent of Democrats and 48 percent of Republicans in Nevada would support a federal abortion law that aligned with their preferred abortion policy, and majorities of Republicans and Democrats support policies expanding access to birth control. Those policies include requiring schools to provide education about birth control, ensuring access to birth control across the county, continuing the Affordable Care Act mandate that insurance plans cover long-term birth control options and increasing funding for health care clinics providing free or low-cost birth control. “People are uncomfortable with there being abortions and they're wanting to reduce abortions,” Kull said. “It appears that one of the directions they go is to support access to birth control to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies to begin with.” This year, as Democrats push a ballot measure to enshrine abortion access in the Nevada Constitution, they’re hoping the issue will once again help galvanize Democratic voters in Nevada to turn out and elect Vice President Kamala Harris as president, re-elect U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and win support for other Democrats down the ballot. Democrats have said enshrining abortion rights in the state Constitution is necessary after the fall ofRoe v. Wadetwo years ago led to states across the nation enacting abortion bans. The University of Maryland survey is one of six issue-focused polls the group is conducting in swing states ahead of the 2024 general election. In Nevada, 544 adults were polled in online opt-in surveys from June 18 to July 3, with a margin of error of 4.8 percent. In open-ended answers, respondents wrote about the need for people to make health-care decisions for themselves, the potential for unwanted pregnancies to lead to neglect for a child and the risks criminalizing abortion present to public health by forcing pregnant people to seek unsafe procedures. “I feel that a woman's right to choose to make her own decisions should be hers and hers alone,” wrote one survey respondent. “Legislatures who pass laws without regard to a woman's right are wrong. It is not the job of [the] government to legislate morality.” Across all six swing states surveyed, researchers indicated that the public overestimated nationwide support for criminalizing abortion, with the majority estimating 40 percent or more of Americans support criminalizing the procedure, whereas the actual level of support is 11 percent. From federal to local elections, abortion emerged as a bellwether issue following the end ofRoe v. Wadein 2022. The ending of the federal protections resulted in efforts to enact abortion bans by Republicans and efforts to protect abortion access by Democrats. Candidates have either latched onto abortion as a way to motivate voters or shied away from the subject altogether, downplaying the issue. While Rosen has made protecting abortion rights a visible part of her re-election campaign this cycle, her Republican challenger Sam Brown has been less firm on his stance, avoiding concrete answers to abortion-related policy questions. Inrecent audioobtained byThe Nevada Independent,Brown refused to say whether he would support the abortion protections going before voters in November. Though the survey focused on criminalization, it also assessed voters' perceptions of attempts to reduce abortions through mandatory ultrasounds, required waiting periods and bans on the federal government paying for abortions. About half of respondents indicated they disapproved of federal law that does not allow federal funds to pay for abortion costs, unless the pregnancy is a result of rape, incest or endangers the pregnant person’s life. More than 62 percent of Nevada Democratic respondents said they opposed the federal policy compared to almost 36 percent of Republican respondents. “Women should not be put in a position where they have to make a certain amount of money to be able to have the procedure done,” one respondent wrote. Respondents were less supportive of policies aiming to reduce abortion through mandatory ultrasounds and waiting periods. Though 56 percent of Nevada voters said they would oppose such policies, about half of Republicans (52 percent) said they were in favor of requiring doctors to show an ultrasound of a fetus to the parent before an abortion and 49 percent of Republicans said they would support requiring a one- to three-day mandatory waiting period before an abortion. A majority of Democrats opposed these policies.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/the-inflation-reduction-act-may-transform-nevada-will-voters-care,True,"About a month after President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — a landmark, multibillion dollar law making the biggest climate investment in American history — Lithium Americas opened the doors to its Reno-based lithium processing facility. The Canadian company began exploring northwestern Nevada for lithium — the soft, silvery element used to power batteries of electronic goods — nearly 20 years ago. By the time the law was passed in 2022, the company already had been through the federal permitting process to open a lithium mine at Thacker Pass, near the Oregon border. What it needed was funding; and with the IRA came an opportunity. Among the law’s many provisions was a tenfoldexpansionof a Department of Energy loan program with a mandate to front the capital required for massive clean-energy projects, including those that could mine and produce lithium batteries. With an expected $3 billion in capital costs, Lithium Americas applied for funding. This March, the Department of Energy announced a conditional commitment of $2.26 billion to fund the construction of an on-site lithium carbonate processing plant. The company expects to close on the loan soon (in advance of the 2024 election) and get to work. With a project-labor agreement already in place, Lithium Americas’ goal is to open its mine in 2027. And therein lies the promise — and the problem — for Democrats. The IRA has undoubtedly been a boon for Nevada, bringing in unprecedented federal dollars, spurring private investment and creating jobs. But with the landmark law hitting its two-year anniversary this August, the gap between its passage and tangible results — such as the opening of the Thacker Pass mine — could be its undoing. Republicans have threatened to revoke many of the law’s provisions if they take control of government, halting progress before it even begins. “We have all these burgeoning industries getting ready to just take off and totally transform Nevada,” said Rob Benner, the secretary-treasurer of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Northern Nevada, the union that has already secured a project-labor agreement to do construction for Lithium Americas. “That could all stop, and then we're back to square one, where we’re not getting the assistance from the federal government.” In interviews, more than a dozen industry players, lawmakers and environmental advocates touted the law’s transformational potential and existing impact in Nevada. But the bureaucratic and corporate timelines of the IRA’s funding provisions move much slower than the election cycle. One industry expert recalled a June interview meeting with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who put up a chart during a presentation at Truckee Meadows Community College showing the number of projects nationwide that had received funding from the IRA. Many projects would be getting loans from the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office (LPO) — which the IRAincreasedfunding for exponentially — but were years away from being operational. ""The LPO loan support has been tremendous for electrifying our economy,"" the expert, granted anonymity to discuss politics candidly, said. ""But will the president get credit for it?  Maybe not, because these projects are years away from actually producing anything."" ‘Extraordinary and game-changing’ When the Inflation Reduction Act passed both chambers of Congress — with no Republican votes and the support of all five Nevada Democrats — it authorized $783 billion in new spending to stimulate clean energy and combat climate change through a combination of tax credits for consumers and companies and new grant programs to fund states, localities and tribes’ clean energy-focused programs. In Nevada, where an abundance of natural resources and a business-friendly tax code had already attracted companies working in the lithium and solar energy spaces, the IRA has been a boon. Not all states are created equal in the IRA’s eyes — much investment, ironically, has been concentrated in red states across the South, but experts and industry watchers from Reno to Las Vegas to the White House say a perfect storm of factors makes the state poised to capitalize on the IRA. “Nevada is positioned to own the full finish line when it comes to the shift to clean transportation,” White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said in an interview. The lithium battery and solar industries already have a Nevada footprint, from Tesla and Redwood Materials in the north to an array of solar installation companies in the south. An existing union-ready workforce in both parts of the state gives it a leg up to compete for federally funded projects, where prevailing wage standards are baked into the investment formula — particularly in construction. The IRA’s role has been to provide the economic certainty for companies to conduct business in the state — and in that sense, it’s already proven successful. “Just looking at these federal investments — the size of the federal investments — in these companies within the lithium supply chain … it's been extraordinary and game changing,” said Caleb Cage, the coordinator of the Nevada Battery Coalition, a lithium industry trade group launched last year with many members who have successfully claimed the tax credits. The White House estimates that private companies, spurred by IRA incentives, have poured $10 billion into the electric vehicle, battery and clean-power industries in Nevada. Climate Power, a Democratic-aligned clean-energy advocacy group,estimatesthat nearly 20,500 clean-energy jobs have been announced in Nevada since the law’s passage two years ago, primarily in the battery sector. Despite being ranked 32nd among the states in population, more clean-energy jobs have been created in Nevada since the IRA’s passage than all but six states, per Climate Power’s analysis. Projects such as the Unimacts factory — a Las Vegas solar manufacturing facility thathired80 new people to triple production due to IRA incentives — have come online. NV Energy was able to fund 40 percent of the gross cost of its Reid Gardner Battery Energy Storage System northeast of Las Vegas through the relevant IRA tax credit, Cage said — and pass those savings onto utility customers. Stephen Hamile, the chief operating officer of SolUp, the state’s largest independently owned solar company, said the IRA has become araison d’etrefor the business. “It really legitimized the industry,” Hamile said. “Solar was kind of like cryptocurrency — you heard about it, some people adopted it, some people dabbled in it, but a lot of people were afraid of it.” With IRA tax credits incentivizing solar, there’s now an economic impetus to move toward solar that (especially with high interest rates) did not exist before — and with IRA-funded grants offering solar financial assistance to low-income residents, a burgeoning new market for solar companies and contractors. Hamile said his company has been able to hire more top-quality candidates looking for long-term careers in renewable energy this year than ever before. Benner said even though many of the IRA funds — including the loans to companies such as Lithium Americas and Redwood Materials — haven’t closed yet, the law has injected a level of certainty into the clean-energy economy in Northern Nevada. From his perspective, that creates a lot of construction jobs for his members — and a need for the level of workforce development and apprenticeships that unions are best equipped to provide. “Things that have started over the last 10 to 20 years have just been put on steroids,” Benner said. “It's just really been accelerated.” Timeline Despite an enormous push between universities, community colleges, industry and governments to begin bringing projects online, many of the law’s biggest impacts won’t be felt until after the 2024 election. “The full economic and employment benefits from these investments in this industry in our state are yet to be seen,” Cage said. “But I think they will be significant.” For example, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) is currently working to implement the Solar for All Program, after receiving $156 million in IRA grants to provide education and low-cost or no-cost loans and rebates for rooftop solar for low-income households and multifamily buildings. The money has been obligated, but the federal government — requiring detailed planning from each state — hasn’t released the money. Greg Zegas, the NCEF director of investments, expects the money to be available by the end of September — insulating that program from any legislative changes in the next Congress, and giving the agency time to budget out program funds and identify project contractors. But as a five-year program, the move toward solar energy in low-income communities (and any potential bill savings) will largely be felt in the future. But all of that potential is contingent on the money still being there past this election. The same dilemma is playing out on the county level — there’s plenty of money out there, but the speed at which it can be deployed into communities is running up against the electoral timeline. Brian Beffort, the Washoe County sustainability manager, has a mandate to ensure the county does not leave any federal money on the table — no small task, he says, because there is so much of it and grant writing takes capacity and staff. But as he chases down federal funds to electrify the county’s vehicle fleet, build out an electric vehicle charger network, implement community forestry plans and bring solar panels to municipal buildings, many grants have not yet been obligated or are reimbursable, meaning it won’t arrive until the next tax year. The county’s plans are measured in years; the election, of course, is in less than three months. “That's the glacial speed of government,” Beffort said. “It takes time to apply for these grants, [and for] the decision making for them to go through.” Is Nevada ready? Everyone from industry leaders to labor to politicians agree — the key to Nevada unlocking the potential of the IRA lies in its ability to conduct sustainable workforce development, long a policy goal in a state still heavily dependent on gambling and hospitality. Skilled workers are needed to do rooftop solar installations; workers need to be trained on clean-energy systems eligible for IRA tax credits such as heat pumps and other energy-efficiency technology. Nevada’s clean-energy industry is clearly growing — the Department of Energy’sannual employment reportfound that Nevada had the second-highest growth rate for energy-efficiency jobs between 2022 and 2023, at nearly 7 percent, and the state increased its overall clean energy jobs total by nearly 4 percent. But the industry remains small — less than 3 percent of the state’s total jobs in 2023, per data from DOE and thestate. Forty-one percent of employers across the energy sector reported difficulty hiring — a significant percentage, but good for 12th lowest among states. Beyond the typical challenges of lower educational levels and a transient population, Nevada faces workforce development challenges amid the rush of new technologies in the battery recycling sector, where Nevada companies such asRedwood MaterialsandAmerican Battery Technology Company— IRA loan beneficiaries — are pioneering the process. Cage compared training the workforce for the lithium battery industry to “building an airplane in flight.” And the majority of the job growth in each clean sector DOE measured came in construction — illuminating that much of the state’s new clean-energy projects are in an incipient phase. “Everybody in this landscape in Nevada realizes that in order for Nevada to fully take advantage of all these federal funds, there has to be a larger workforce,” said Zegas. “Whether it's solar or home energy upgrades, like heat pumps, there needs to be a sort of rising of the tide.” But the tide takes time. In Southern Nevada, for example, Perry Ursem, the senior vice president of business development for the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance, said he expects it will take two to three years to set up and begin graduating workers through an education pipeline for jobs in the lithium battery sector “just because we don't have a depth of industry,” he said. So what is the state doing about it? Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has made a point to show up at federal clean-energy events including Redwood Materials’loan announcement, to hit on an electoral theme of his — that Nevada is open for business. To fully live up to that credo, the administration understands that it needs to prepare and train the right workforce to take those jobs of the future. “The energy industry is growing,” Dwayne McClinton, the director of the Governor’s Office of Energy, said in an interview. “We must have the workforce to support the growing energy industry needs.” Still, Lombardo’s administration has neither embraced theideological oppositionto clean energy that has taken root in parts of the Republican Party nor the enthusiastic embrace of emissions targets championed by his Democratic predecessor. Lombardo and McClinton have advocated for an “all-of-the-above” energy approach. While that language is common among climate-conscious Republicans, Nevada has little to no oil and produces relatively small amounts of natural gas, importing much of its fuel from California. What it does have is significant amounts of solar, geothermal and other noncombustible renewable-energy sources. To that end, the state has continued to apply for federal grants, and McClinton says the office’s objective is to “leave no money on the table.” “The goal is the same — to decarbonize at the end of the day,” McClinton said. “We're taking steps to decarbonize. I think it just [has] to be a realistic, holistic and a sensible approach to that.” McClinton described a two-pronged approach of chasing federal funds and using policy to attract clean-energy developers and manufacturers. Nevada’s generous state tax abatements  — which incentivized companies such as Tesla to set up shop in Northern Nevada — are a prime example. But clean-energy advocates say more is needed at the state level to unleash the full potential of federal investments. The IRA was passed months before Lombardo was elected over then-Gov. Steve Sisolak (D), who had set up much of the state executive infrastructure around climate. And advocates were less than pleased with the governor’slong-anticipated state climate plan, which advocated for embracing electrification and natural gas and wanting Nevada to become a clean-energy economic engine without much specificity on how to get there. “I don't feel like the Lombardo administration is blocking anything,” said Jarrett Clark, an organizer with progressive organization For Our Future Fund Nevada, which focuses on climate. “But I don't think they're doing anything to speed it along.” Those working in clean energy described McClinton as a mostly willing partner who embraces renewable energy, but several said the Lombardo administration’s approach toward electrification is noticeably more hesitant than Sisolak’s. There’s a natural learning curve to an administration staffed with new employees — and a lack of staff capacity compared to blue state peers — that advocates say has made Nevada a less helpful partner to municipalities than leaders such as California and Colorado. “We need more capacity to roll it out faster,” Beffort with Washoe County said. “[We’re] still waiting for them to roll out some of their incentives — but I have other things to work on until that happens.” To that end, while Nevada has excelled in some grant competitions, such as bringing home the most funding per capita in Solar for All, it has missed out on other opportunities, such as funding to build outelectricvehiclecharging networks — one of just 15 states to receive no awards — and animplementation grantfor community-oriented climate solutions. Just the size of the GOE tells a story; the Nevada office has 11 employees, compared to Colorado’s 81 or Oregon’s 105. But industry players also said the business-friendly climate in Nevada, including the tax abatements, give the state a significant leg up versus more overtly climate-oriented states in the West, especially should elements of the IRA disappear under GOP control of Congress. Questions about how Nevada can best take advantage of the IRA — and where politicians fall on it — will likely come up at the Legislature in 2025, where solar advocates are hoping to rework Nevada law aroundrooftop solar and net meteringto better include low-income communities. “The IRA is phenomenal — it truly is,” Hamile with SolUp said. “But it's based on state adoption, and some states are much more restrictive that really don't allow us to take advantage of the IRA — especially here [in Nevada].” The electoral connection For elected officials, environmental advocates and other Democratic allies, the mission this fall is to convince voters to support a clean-energy agenda they may not yet feel but promises to have massive ramifications for jobs and energy prices — if it remains intact. It involves trying to convince voters of a double counterfactual: if Republicans take office, they will remove provisions of a law that voters likely don’t know about and won’t feel the full effect before November. Clark and his For Our Future Fund Nevada colleague Madison McGrath said that in door-knocking, voters are typically aware of the health care and economic portions of the Inflation Reduction Act — such as the cap on the price of insulin for seniors — but often have not heard of the clean-energy provisions. So, they’ve rebranded their pitch entirely, referring to “President Biden’s clean-energy plan” rather than the law itself and making an economic appeal to voters about their high energy bills. Clark said he’ll often tell voters that even if they’re not ready to replace their washing machine or dishwasher just yet, they’ll want the IRA tax credits available to them to get energy-efficient appliances a few years down the line. “[The] message that we're trying to really impress upon voters is you might not be feeling this right now, because those things take time, [and] it's a lot of money, and it doesn't just, unfortunately, show up as a wire transfer to your account,” Clark said. “But if you want it to be there even in just two years, we need to protect the progress that we made.” At the consumer level, the White House estimates more than $96 million is available in home energy rebates to Nevadans to replace appliances with energy-efficiency models, add solar panels and weatherize. Through tax filings, the Treasury Department found that between 44,000 families in the state, Nevadans claimed over $137 million in IRA clean energy tax credits in 2023. McGrath said it’s critical to do voter education on who voted for the clean-energy incentives — which in Northern Nevada, means reminding voters that Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) was a yes while Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) was a no. Amodei — whose district has been among the law’s biggest beneficiaries — has been put in a tricky spot by the IRA. While he’s maintained that his “no” vote on the 2022 legislation was based on serious issues with the structure of the bill and its level of spending, he was one of 18 House Republicans towriteto Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) urging him to leave the law’s tax credits in place if Republicans get a government trifecta come 2025. The letter is an acknowledgment of the investment and jobs the credits have brought to Republican districts and a warning that Republicans are indeed planning to target them — House Republicans’ 2025 budgetincludesa provision to repeal $250 billion worth of IRA clean-energy spending. Every Republican in Congressvoted againstthe bill, criticizing the price tag, decrying an energy strategy that favors renewables and claiming it could raise energy prices and even benefit China. Former President Donald Trump himself hasrailedagainst clean energy and promised to “terminate … all new spending grants and giveaways … like the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.” And Project 2025, the conservative policy framework created by Trump allies,pledgesto eliminate IRA-created clean-energy tax credits. But the jobs benefits accruing in red districts such as Amodei’screatesat least some Republican constituency for leaving the law intact — their letter said a full repeal would “create a worst-case scenario where we would have spent billions of taxpayer dollars and received next to nothing in return.” In Southern Nevada, organizers are working with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the building trades to make an economic development pitch to voters — particularly those who have been burned before by Las Vegas’ fragile, tourism-based economy. “These are good things, union jobs, jobs that can sustain a family, as opposed to cobbling together a living off of two or three,” Clark said. “We're trying to make that pitch that these are stable jobs that aren't subject as much to the fluctuations in our market.” For Benner, union member education and political mobilization go hand-in-hand. He plans to counteract messaging that union members see on social media and inform people who may not know which party authorized the funding for the clean-energy projects they’re working on. “All these investments that you know are creating the jobs that you're working on have the potential of going bye-bye,” Benner said. “That’s the big one this cycle.” In a state — and a country — where the presidential and congressional elections will be decided by a handful of swing voters, the fate of the IRA could lie in Democrats’ ability to convince those voters of its transformational power. But it hasn’t proven as powerful a message as abortion or drug pricing for Democrats. Republican-aligned organizations haveaired adsattacking Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) on gas prices and support for electric vehicles — Rosen has talked about bringing funding for workforce development in herads, but has not mentioned clean energy yet. It’s a dynamic the White House is acutely aware of. While Zaidi noted the progress of job creation, new construction, enormous clean-energy capacity added to the grid and the presence of tax credit-eligible appliances and vehicles from Home Depot to car dealerships, he knows unlocking the IRA’s potential will take years. It’s why the tax credits were made to last 10 years in the first place — and why the possibility of repeal remains stressful to industry figures and advocates alike. “Winning the clean-energy future is a long game,” Zaidi said. “We can either lean into a massive economic opportunity for our workers and communities, or we can pull the rug out from under them.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-no-sales-tax-on-diapers-question-5-on-the-2024-nevada-ballot,True,"Nevada voters will have the opportunity this November to vote on whether to exempt diapers from the state’s sales tax. If passed, how would it work? Summary of what it does:The ballot measure would amend the state’s1955 Sales and Use Tax, which established state sales tax on revenue from personal property. The law has several exemptions baked in, many through recent ballot initiatives. Items that are not subject to sales tax include food, farm equipment, feminine hygiene products and prosthetic devices. Question 5 would apply to child and adult diapers. The state sales tax rate is 6.85 percent, though the rate varies by county. The exemption would begin Jan. 1, 2025 and last through the end of 2050. How did we get here?The question was placed on the ballot by the Legislature via a bill designed to amend the voter-approved 1955 sales tax law, which can only be modified by a vote of the people at the ballot. Unlike proposed constitutional changes, the question can proceed to the ballot after just one legislative session. Introduced asSB428in the 2023 Legislature, the bill passed each chamber unanimously and was signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo in June 2023, securing its place on the ballot. What have other states done?If passed, Nevada will join19 states— ranging from red states such as North Dakota and Texas to blue states such as California and New York — and the District of Columbia in exempting diapers from the sales tax. Argument for passing Question 5:In addition to unanimous support from state legislators, Question 5 is backed by local organizations. Nevada diaper bank nonprofit Baby’s Bounty and progressive organization Battle Born Progress are among its supporters. In aletterto lawmakers last year, Baby’s Bounty Executive Director Kelly Maxwell wrote that newborns can require eight to 10 diapers per day, costing as much as $1,200 per year. Removing the sales tax will help reduce those costs for families of young children, advocates say. A number of state and local elected officials wrotelettersin support as well, including state Treasurer Zach Conine and Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar, both Democrats. “As Nevada’s chief investment officer, I see firsthand how much strain Nevada families are currently under as a result of changing market conditions, inflation and rising costs for everyday essentials,” Conine wrote. “Nowhere is this more evident for new parents in our State, than with diapers.” Arguments against passing Question 5:In the secretary of state’sballot question summary, the law’s expected fiscal impact is noted as an argument against passage. Throughout the 25 years during which the exemption would be in effect, the state estimates that $400 million in tax revenue would be lost between state and local governments. The argument against it notes that other essential items such as soap and toothpaste are subject to sales tax, and a diaper exemption favors specific groups of people. Primary funders:There were no political action committees registered to support or oppose the measure. Financial impact:The state’sfiscal noteestimates that had the diaper exemption been in effect in fiscal year 2024, the state would have lost $7.9 million revenue. In addition, 14 of Nevada’s 17 counties impose an additional sales tax — the state estimates those counties would have lost out on an additional $1.6 million in revenue. But the analysis notes that it does not incorporate the possibility that Nevadans will spend more on other taxable products due to their sales tax savings on diapers.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-majority-of-nevadans-support-nato-continuing-aid-to-ukraine,True,"Nearly two-thirds of Nevada voters support continuing military assistance to Ukraine — a key political issue that has divided the Republican Party and will be a major international issue for the next president. Sixty-four percent of Nevadans, after being presented with arguments in favor of and against continued American support of Ukraine in its war against Russia, believe in continuing assistance to the country, according to a newpoll. Support for Ukraine varied significantly between Democrats and Republicans — 78 percent of Nevada Democrats want to see military assistance continue, only 50 percent of Republicans indicated the same. Nevadans’ agreement with aid for Ukraine skewed close to the national average of 67 percent, per the poll. Nevadans with a college degree and those younger than 29 showed the highest percentages of support, while white voters and women were among the lowest, though still above 60 percent. The poll is the latest to be conducted by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy, and is one of several issue-focused polls the group is conducting in swing states ahead of the 2024 general election. In Nevada, 604 adults were polled in online opt-in surveys from July 19 to Aug. 2, with a margin of error of 4.5 percent. Nevadans were also polled on their belief in collective security principles promoted by the United Nations, the U.S.’ continued involvement in NATO and participation in the global moratorium on nuclear testing, with majorities supporting continued U.S. engagement in each instance of multinational cooperation. While Democrats were more in favor of continued U.S. participation in collective security, NATO and abiding by the moratorium on nuclear testing than Republicans, the partisan gap was most stark on the issue of Ukraine — reflecting the national divide on the issue in Congress. President Joe Biden has forcefully made the case for continued military aid to Ukraine on the basis of the NATO agreement, meant to deter Russian aggression. While Ukraine is not a NATO member nation, its neighbors, such as Poland, are — meaning the U.S. has a duty to come to its defense if it were to be attacked. Biden and allies have argued that arming Ukraine, as it has since the Russian invasion began in early 2022, is a significant deterrent toward future U.S. military involvement. If Russia were to easily take Ukraine, they argue, Russian President Vladimir Putin could be emboldened to threaten a NATO country, obligating the U.S. to send troops. That line of thinking was persuasive to several respondents. “We can either spend blood or treasure,” one respondent wrote in an open-ended response supporting military assistance to Ukraine. “Spending treasure is preferred.” But with Ukraine having become a partisan flashpoint, the partisan gap was evident in the poll. While 84 percent of Democrats and 73 percent of Republicans favored the U.S. continuing to be part of NATO (an 11 percentage point difference), the gap swelled to 28 percentage points when respondents were polled on whether the U.S. should send military aid to Ukraine. “Americans really do respond, in general, to the whole notion of collective security and that countries should band together to protect nations from aggression,” pollster Steven Kull, a political psychologist at the University of Maryland and director of the Program for Public Consultation, said in an interview withThe Nevada Independent. “And then you get into the specifics of Ukraine and how long it's been going on, and then you have more of a partisan split.” The debate played out on Capitol Hill in the winter, after House Republicans held hostage a national security supplemental package providing military assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, in addition to stricter regulations at the U.S.-Mexico border, over a dispute about how to tackle the border. Eventually, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) brought each of the national security-focused parts to the floor in April. Nevada Democratic Reps. Dina Titus, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford, as well as the state’s two Democratic senators, voted in favor of the Ukraine supplemental, while Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), who had previously been in support of funding Ukraine,votedno. Among GOP House candidates, Drew Johnson, running against Lee, visited Ukraine in 2023 and hassaidthat the solution to ending the war is neither “blank checks” to Ukraine nor “looking the other way while a brutal dictator invades sovereign nations.” In an email toThe Nevada Independent, Republican candidate Mark Robertson (who is facing Titus) said he supports sending weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, but not financial assistance, for fear of corruption. “It is vital that we maintain and strengthen the NATO alliance, while insisting that all member countries contribute their agreed to amounts,” he added. Meanwhile, former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, running against Horsford, criticized his opponent for voting for Ukraine aid and referred to the war as an “endless foreign entanglement” that Congress had prioritized over domestic concerns. “We can’t keep writing blank checks overseas while our own borders and communities are suffering,” Lee said in a statement toThe Nevada Independent. The Republican Party has been split on the issue, with much of the opposition led by former President Donald Trump. Trump haspledgedto leave NATO if elected again and has suggested ending the Russia-Ukraine war by negotiating a peace deal that would allow Russia to keep parts of Ukraine. He has alsosaidhe would “encourage” Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” with NATO members who do not live up to the agreement’s spending targets. Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), his running mate, has been one of the strongest skeptics of the post-World War II international order in Congress. Vance hasarguedthroughout the course of the war that the U.S. has already spent too much money on Ukraine and that he “[doesn’t] really care” what happens to the war-torn country. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has expressed positions in line with Biden,pledgingat the Democratic National Convention to “stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.” The poll found Trump’s position on NATO is out of step with the majority of Nevadans. While majorities found arguments against continued NATO participation convincing, when asked to make a decision, 76 percent of Nevadans favored staying in NATO — including 73 percent of Republicans. “It’s eight in 10,” Kull said. “We're talking really robust responses. And we put in front of them [that] the U.S. has been spending tens of billions of dollars on this. But in the end, it's quite strong.” Down the ballot, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) has continuallyvotedin support of continuing Ukraine assistance. Her Republican opponent Sam Brown’s position on Ukraine has been moremurky; he has called for “no more blank checks” to Ukraine and said that more accountability is needed, while saying after winning the nomination that the U.S.should not “turn off”military assistance. Nevadans polled also broadly agreed with abiding by the international moratorium on nuclear testing (73 percent) and that Congress should have to authorize an offensive nuclear strike (63 percent). In the mid-20th century, the U.S. military conducted nuclear tests in the desert in Nye County, raising environmental and public health concerns for those who lived through it. “We still do not know the long term effects of the testing that was done previously, let alone what future weapons could do,” one respondent wrote. “Why mess around and mess up the planet even more?” This story was updated at 8 a.m. on 8/28/2024 to add a statement from John Lee.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rfk-jr-wont-appear-on-nevada-presidential-ballot-after-agreement-with-state-dems,True,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will not appear on Nevada’s presidential ballot as an independent candidate after reaching an agreement with the state Democrats, who had sued to kick him off the ballot. Kennedy suspended his campaign for president last week and sought to remove himself from the ballot in swing states — presumably including Nevada — but his campaignmissed the deadlineto withdraw from the Nevada ballot. That meant the only way for him to stay off the ballot was the ongoing lawsuit brought by the Nevada Democratic Party. Both sides reached an agreement this week to drop the lawsuit and remove Kennedy from the ballot, said Todd Bice, one of the lawyers representing state Democrats. Theagreementwas signed Tuesday by former Carson City District Court Judge William Maddox on behalf of Judge James Russell, who presided over the case. The agreement outlines that Kennedy and his running mate Nicole Shanahan had filed a petition to gain ballot access, that they will now no longer appear on the ballot and that the lawsuit is dismissed with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought back to court. “Withdrawing our objections to the petition … was the easiest way to come off the ballot, which is what we wanted,” said Paul Rossi, a Kennedy campaign ballot access attorney. The Nevada Democratic Party’slawsuitto kick Kennedy off the ballot argued his affiliation with other political parties violates the state’s legal requirements for independent candidates. At the time of the lawsuit, Kennedy was a registered Democrat in New York (he now has no party affiliation) and is running as a member of a third party in a host of other states. Hilary Barrett, the executive director of the Nevada Democratic Party, said in a statement that removing Kennedy “from the ballot is the right way to move forward in the state.” “As we have said repeatedly, every candidate should play by the rules. RFK Jr.’s campaign did not meet the requirements necessary to run as an Independent non-affiliated party candidate in Nevada,” the statement said. The agreement marks the presumed end to a monthslong, chaotic legal battle surrounding his ballot access in Nevada. His initial ballot petition was consideredinvalidfor not including a running mate, as required under Nevada law — which his campaign saidamounted to corruptionbecause it was operating on faulty advice from the secretary of state’s office — and his campaign is still engaged in a now effectively mootlawsuitrelated to that decision. Its second petition wasrescindedafter misspelling “United States” and the third petition gathered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, which the campaigncelebratedas having defeated an “attempt to block ballot access in Nevada.” The electoral implications of Kennedy’s removal are not immediately clear. When third party candidates are included, former President Donald Trump’s lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in Nevada increases from1.4 percentto2.2 percent, according to data from poll aggregatorRealClearPolitics.Kennedy has hovered around 5 percent of the Nevada vote share. An internalcampaign memofrom Trump’s pollster last week — released after Kennedy endorsed Trump — found that Kennedy supporters supported Trump over Harris in Nevada more than any other swing state. The data, which did not include a source, found 66 percent of Kennedy supporters in Nevada breaking for Trump and 16 percent backing Harris, with the rest undecided. Kennedy, the environmental lawyer nephew of John F. Kennedy who rose to prominence for promoting anti-vaccine conspiracies during the pandemic, has run a freewheeling independent campaign for president after initially running as a Democrat last year. He made two stops in Las Vegas, one at aFebruary rallyand theotherat the annual FreedomFest conference, which is billed as the ""world's largest gathering of free minds.” On Tuesday, TrumpnamedKennedy as a co-chair on his transition team.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/as-race-narrows-trump-campaign-ramps-up-in-nevada,True,"Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is ramping up its presence in Nevada on the airwaves and through volunteer efforts as the race tightens, closing the gap with Democrats’ more established ground game in the Silver State. The Trump campaign now has five Nevada offices open — four in Southern Nevada and one in Northern Nevada — and is relying on its“Trump Force 47”program to recruit volunteers, a nationwide effort thatbegan in late May. It is hosting weekly events that include door knocking, new volunteer orientation and training on election integrity, and a campaign spokesperson said additional staff hiring is underway. “For many years, Americans have asked where can I help and the answer has not always been clear,” a campaign spokesperson wrote. “This year we have an answer, and it is to sign up at Trump Force 47 to get involved.” Trumpand his running mate, Sen.JD Vance(R-OH) have held public events in Las Vegas in the past month, and pro-Trump advertising in Nevada has recently skyrocketed, though Republicans have not reserved any ad space beyond the week of Sept. 3, while Democrats have reserved more than $14 million worth of space through the election. In the past four weeks, pro-Trump groups have spent $9.7 million on ads airing in Nevada, while pro-Democratic groups have spent $10.2 million, according toAdImpact,an ad-tracking organization. Before Biden dropped out, Democrats spent more than $21 million on presidential election ads in Nevada, while Republicans spent about $2 million. It all signals the Trump campaign’s heightened focus on Nevada and its six electoral votes after it reportedly viewed the state as asurefire winwhen President Joe Biden — who had not led in a singleNevada pollthis year — was still in the race. Since replacing Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris has generallypolled evenlywith Trump in Nevada. But Trump’s campaign infrastructure still lags behind Harris’ campaign, which inherited all of the Biden campaign’s ground game when he dropped out. In conjunction with the Nevada Democratic Party, the Harris campaign is operating 14 offices across the state and has more than 100 full-time employees, a campaign official said. From Aug. 17-25, the campaign held 377 events, and volunteers knocked on nearly 19,000 doors, the official said.  The Trump campaign, meanwhile, has about 24 full-time staffers in Nevada, a spokesperson said. The five Trump campaign offices are in central Las Vegas, Spring Valley, Henderson, Centennial Hills and Reno, with the Henderson office opening most recently on July 1. A campaign spokesperson said these locations operate as hubs for supporters to stay informed on how to participate in Trump Force 47. There are 16 events scheduled within the next week, including a Lake Mead boat parade. Still, the campaign has two fewer field offices in Nevada than it didin 2020, when Trump lost to Biden by about 34,000 votes, and the Republican National Committee’sonce-touted minority outreach centerswere not reopened after the 2022 midterms. But at an event in Las Vegas on Friday, Trump appeared unconcerned about the state of the race, again referring to false claims that the only way Democrats could win the election is by cheating. “I don’t know how we can lose it,” he said. “We win this state, we win the whole thing.” Election optimism Optimism was prevalent among attendees of Trump’s Friday event. The Nevada Independentinterviewed eight attendees at the Il Toro E La Capra restaurant, many of whom expressed confidence about Trump’s chances and deep skepticism about recent polling trends showing Harris making up ground. Read More: In Vegas, Trump touts proposal to end taxes on tipped wages Justin Franks, a 52-year-old who works in construction, dismissed any notion that Harris had momentum coming out of the Democratic National Convention last week, adding that he thinks any poll showing otherwise is biased. “The state of the race is Trump is leading by a mile,” Franks said. “When you look at all of the sentiment in the country, everybody wants Trump, anybody with half a brain wants Trump.” Nancy Hamilton, a 55-year-old real estate photographer, was also skeptical about polls showing Harris’ recent spike in popularity. “I don't know how much we believe the media,” Hamilton said. “She wasn't too popular.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/d-c-download-three-nevada-takeaways-from-the-dnc,True,"Happy post-Democratic National Convention Saturday, where we have 73 days to go until the election. I wasn’t in Chicago this week, but Lil’ Jon’s voting-themed performance of “Get Low” is still stuck in my head and there are plenty of Nevada highlights to go through. As I did for theRepublican National Convention, let’s jump right to The Nevada Angle and review how the Silver State made its mark on the convention. The Nevada Angle: DNC A train of up-and-coming Democratic stars stopped by the Nevada delegation’s breakfasts in Chicago this week to address the Silver State delegates whose influence will be paramount come the next competitive Democratic presidential primary. Among the ambitious electeds who stopped by: Of course, delegates were addressed by their Nevada elected officials too. Those who spoke used their times differently — some fired up the crowd, while others introduced themselves and gave a rundown of their accomplishments. A group of speakers that included four people who have already run for president know better than anyone how critical the Silver State is to their political ambitions, and flattered the crowd as such. Alluding to their shared status as second-in-the-nation primaries, Booker — who was not on the schedule — told delegates that he had spoken to the New Hampshire delegates that morning and therefore had to talk to Nevadans too. Mentioning that his mom lives in the state, he also called party Chair Daniele Monroe-Moreno his “favorite party chairwoman,” joking with the crowd to not tell the Democratic Party of New Jersey. Su pledged to return to Nevada on the campaign trail soon; Beshear said Nevada needs to elect a Democratic governor come 2026. Samantha Crunkilton, a Nevada delegate and DNC committeewoman, said Buttigieg, Beshear, Moore and Pritzker were highlights but acknowledged that the energy needs to be translated into turning out voters. “Our delegation had a ton of fun at all the breakfasts and being on the floor and hanging out — being around everyone, and all the energy,” she said in an interview. “Every morning it's like, 76 days, 75 days [until the election]. We're ready to get home and do the work and knock doors and talk to voters and get people out.” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV)took the stagefor a primetime speaking slot Wednesday night to boost Vice President Kamala Harris — whom she’sknownsince their attorneys general days and who has emerged as aclose allyin the Senate. The speech was pretty classic CCM, a lawyer known more for deft policymaking than loquaciousness. She used examples of their experiences working together as attorneys general on the foreclosure crisis, human trafficking and transnational criminal justice at the border, punctuating each anecdote with a takeaway and a “That’s Kamala Harris!” “Trust me when I say I know she will fight for our families and our freedoms,” Cortez Masto said. “Now, we must fight for her!” Nevada’s senior senator has a unique vantage point to do that because she is the only member of the congressional delegation not running for re-election in 2024. Notably, her counterpart Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), skipped the convention to hit the campaign trail. Cortez Masto told the convention about her own 2022 re-election bid, delivered by fewer than 8,000 voters, as a testament to how Harris can win the state. It also served as a reminder to Democrats about how narrow the margins can be in Nevada — Republicans recalling that figure are surely thinking the same thing about their own prospects. In their 90 seconds to make their case during the DNC roll call, Nevada Democratshit a reliable theme— representing America. “Nevada is the most diverse battleground state in the country,” Monroe-Moreno said on the convention floor. “Home of the late great Senator Harry Reid, the only Latina ever to serve in the U.S. Senate — Catherine Cortez Masto — and we are the first and only women-majority state Legislature.” It’s the same pitch that Nevada Democrats are using to explain why they believe Harris can win, and one they’ve relied on to try and elevate the Silver State to be the first-in-the-nation primary. Crunkilton said other Democrats understand Nevada’s importance — and that the delegation thinks of themselves as “messengers” to that effect. She said multiple delegates from other states pledged to hold volunteering and phone banking events for Nevada. “There's just a lot of attention on Nevada,” Crunkilton said. “I think that's really important [to] continue that energy.” Around the Capitol 🏘️Millions for veteran housing —The Department of Veterans’ Affairs is sending $8.7 million to two Nevada organizations for veteran housing.

CCM says no—In aninterviewwith Nexstar stations, Cortez Masto continued making the case for her friend Harris by saying she better understood the economic issues that matter to Nevada voters. That includes ending taxes on tips, a policy first floated by Trump — which Cortez Masto said was unserious (while adding that she supports the policy). “He’s bluffing!” Cortez Masto said. “And he’s a political opportunist, and the Culinary members know that.” What I’m Reading Bloomberg Tax:In Vegas where tips rule, distrust mounts over tax-free pitches As everyone rushes to embrace “no taxes on tips,” a view from the ground in Las Vegas.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-banning-slavery-question-4-on-the-2024-nevada-ballot,True,"Nevada voters will have a chance this election to remove language from the state Constitution that allows for slavery or indentured servitude as criminal punishment. Advocates say that Question 4 on the 2024 ballot would help the state advance civil rights for all. But what would the measure actually meanfor the roughly 10,000incarcerated people in Nevada? Summary of what it does:The amended text would read: “Neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever be tolerated in this State.” This scratches the original language, which prohibited involuntary servitude except “in the punishment for crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.” That language appears in other state constitutions and is often referred to as the “penal exception” to the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude in the United States except as punishment for a crime. Southern states took advantage of this loophole in the 19th century to adopt punitive Black codes that allowed authorities to incarcerate Black people for petty crimes, such as vagrancy, and force them to work. Since 2018, several states and members of Congress have pushed to remove penal exception constitutional language, includingseveral measuresthat were approved by voters in Colorado, Nebraska, Utah, Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont. Notably, prison work programs will continue if the measure passes, some which pay aslittle as $0.25 per hour. How did we get here:For the Legislature to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot, the amendment must first pass the Assembly and Senatein two consecutive legislative sessions. The amendment was introduced to the 2021 Legislature asAJR10,and passed unanimously in both chambers during the 2021 and 2023 legislative sessions, securing its place on the 2024 ballot. What have other states done? Eight states have passedballot measuresbetween 2016 and 2022 that removed language in their state constitutions that allowed for enslavement or servitude as punishments for crimes. Similar measures were rejected by voters in Colorado and Louisiana. Argument for passing Question 4:Question 4 received unanimous support from legislators. Civil rights groups such as the Las Vegas NAACP said that it will help promote the rights of Black Americans and other people of color within Nevada. Assemblyman Howard Watts (D-Las Vegas), who sponsored the bill in 2021, said during a legislative hearing last year that the passage of the measure would ensure that nobody will ever have to endure state-sanctioned slavery again, opening a “new chapter” in Nevada history. “We have seen over the last year that the scars of slavery and racism still cause pain throughout this state and our country,” Watts said. “Changing this language is important to help us all heal and demonstrate our commitment to the concept of justice for all.” Arguments against passing Question 4:No arguments against the measure were presented during either legislative session. Ina summary of the ballot questionprepared by the secretary of state’s office, a section titled “Arguments Against Passage” warned that the measure may have “unintended consequences” within the criminal justice system relating to prison work requirements, community service and parole. The passage argues that the measure could create “legal uncertainty” around prison labor. Primary funders:There were no political action committees registered to support or oppose the measure.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-touts-proposal-to-end-taxes-on-tipped-wages-in-las-vegas,True,"Former President Donald Trump touted his proposal to remove taxes on tipped wages while repeating his typical freewheeling campaign messaging and attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris during a campaign stop in Las Vegas on Friday. The event — held at the Il Toro E La Capra restaurant — marked Trump’s fourth appearance in Las Vegas this year and first since Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket last month, upending the presidential race and prompting a surge of Democratic enthusiasm. Trump hadled in Nevada pollsall year before the Democrats replaced President Joe Biden with Harris, and his campaign had considered Nevada aforegone conclusion, but polls have since shown avirtual tie. The former president — whocriss-crossed battleground statesacross the nation this week during the Democratic National Convention — appeared unconcerned about the state of the race in Nevada, saying “I don’t know how we can lose it.” In his 30 minutes of remarks before a group of about 50 invited guests (with hundreds of supporters gathering at a lower level of the restaurant), Trump championed the economy while he was president, pledged to not tax Social Security benefits and made a direct pitch to members of the Culinary Union, the labor organization that represents about 60,000 Nevada hospitality workers andhas endorsedHarris. “Can we get the Culinary Union to maybe vote for Trump?” the former president said to cheers from the crowd. “Because they're great people. They always have a head [who’s] a Democrat … even if the Republican [is] better — and a lot of the Republicans aren't better — but I'm a lot better, and I'm the one that got this thing done.” Despite the polling lead, Trump’s campaign has long trailed Democrats’ in staffing and physical infrastructure, but is expanding its presence in Nevada. A campaign spokesperson said the Trump campaign has five offices in the state (central Las Vegas, Spring Valley, Henderson, Centennial Hills and Reno) and is partnering with the Republican National Committee on “Trump Force 47” to match volunteers with local organizations and campaign activities. The Harris campaign has 14 offices throughout the state. No tax on tips Trump first floated ending taxation on tips at aLas Vegas rallyin mid-June, saying a waiter at his property on the Stripgave himthe idea. Nevada politicians also rushed to embrace it. Sam Brown, the Republican candidate for Senate, said Trump had “scooped” his idea. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226 — while calling Trump an unserious messenger attempting to curry favor with voters —endorseda congressional proposal championed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to deduct their federal income tax for tipped wages. Nevada Democrats, including Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV),signed onas well in mid-July. Trump — mispronouncing Harris’ first name repeatedly — said Harris was unserious about the proposal. “She’s a copycat,” Trump said. “She’s a flip-flopper. She’s the greatest flip-flopper in history. She went from communism to capitalism in about two weeks.” That sentiment was echoed among attendees. Krista Logue, a 45-year-old Starbucks barista, emphasized that “Trump proposed it first.” She believes the extra money from the tax cut would go a long way for her and her husband, who also works in the service industry and mainly relies on tips — especially now that the couple has a child. Logue found Harris’ embrace of the proposal a bit opportunistic, but still appreciated that the idea was gaining traction. “When he was president before we had a good economy,” she said. “Everything was going really well, and now we struggle.” The electoral implications of the policy proposal are enormous in Nevada, which has thehighest percentageof tipped workers of all states, let alone political battlegrounds. Trump released a new ad Friday— “Here’s A Tip” — attacking Harris for “weaponizing the IRS to confiscate your tip money.” The ad language is disingenuous, referring to an early 2023 IRSproposalthat would allow employers, already operating under tip compliance agreements created with the IRS more than 20 years ago, to voluntarily use new technologies to streamline compliance. Tips are already subject to federal income tax — hence both candidates embracing the idea of ending that policy. Getting the credit Trump wants the credit for the policy — and the votes of tipped workers, including rank-and-file members of the Culinary Union. In 2020, en route to a loss in Nevada by approximately 2.5 percentage points, he lost voters earning less than $50,000 annually by 16 percentage points, and union households by 18, perexit polls. Trump said his internal polling shows “a lot” of Culinary members would be supporting him, and pitched a meeting with union leader Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge. A Culinary spokesperson declined to comment. While political opponents have come together in support of ending taxes on tips, labor economists havewarnedthat benefits could be concentrated among the highest tip-earners — such as waiters at high-end restaurants — while giving companies more incentive to keep wages low. Neither Trump nor Harris have offered many details, such as whether payroll taxes are included, if there should be an income cap, whether the benefit will be restricted to certain industries such as hospitality and if it should be structured as a deduction or exemption. But Nicole Williams, a bartender on the Las Vegas Strip for the past 15 years and mother of seven who attended the Friday event, said it would help people like her. Rising prices have forced her to cut back on activities, such as gymnastics and flag football for her children. Removing taxes on tips, Williams said, would offer a lifeline. “When I look at my check and see that not only am I getting taxed on my wages, but I'm getting taxed on tips, it's so frustrating,” Williams said. “It’s going to provide immediate relief to my pocketbook and my seven kids.” On Friday, Trump was still mum on specific policy details, saying that the plan would benefit employees and employers and that workers will be happier due to the tax relief and therefore do a better job. On the border and other topics Trump also used the opportunity to make a direct appeal to Hispanic voters, saying the household wealth of the median Hispanic family grew 65 percent during his administration and that Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low. Data from theCensus Bureaushows that median Hispanic household income rose about 8 percent between 2016 and 2020. While Hispanic unemploymentdid fallsignificantly during the Trump era, hitting a 3.9 percent mark that Biden tied in 2022, the pandemic caused it to rise to a 50-year high, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Beyond tips, Trumpdoubled downon a proposal to end federal taxation on Social Security benefits, which about 40 percent of Social Security recipients pay — a concept popular among retirees but one that economistsfearwould accelerate the program’s insolvency. And he also pledged to cut energy prices in half, offeruniversal school choice, which would permit any student to attend private school through taxpayer-funded vouchers, and conduct the “largest deportation in the history of America.” He said migrants coming over the border — including prisoners from the Democratic Republic of Congo, whichis false— have taken away jobs from Black and Hispanic people, and that union jobs would be next. While his advisers haveurged himto focus on the economy, Trump took multiple asides to bash Biden and Harris, calling each the worst president and vice president in the nation’s history, referring to Biden as angry and confused and making fun of the way Harris said “Thank you” at the Democratic National Convention. He also took questions from reporters after speaking, including one about the release of federal land in Nevada for affordable housing (which hasbipartisan support), to which he responded: “we want to have land, so we can have housing.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rfk-jr-still-likely-to-appear-on-nevada-ballot-despite-rumored-withdrawal-from-race,True,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will likely still appear on the Nevada ballot in November even after hesuspendedhis campaign Friday. Statelawrequires any request for a candidate withdrawal to be made in person by the candidate seven business days after the filing deadline — which was on Aug. 9 for independent presidential candidates — meaning Kennedy would have had to withdraw by Tuesday, Aug. 20, to get off the ballot. The secretary of state’s office said Thursday that it had not received any such request from Kennedy’s campaign. A still-pendinglawsuitfrom the Nevada Democratic Party to kick Kennedy off the ballot would presumably be the only way he would be removed from the ballot. In a speech announcing his campaign’s suspension, Kennedy said he would be withdrawing from the ballot in 10 battleground states but would remain on the ballot in other states, encouraging his supporters there to still vote for him. “Our polling consistently showed that by staying on the ballot in the battleground states, I would likely hand the election over to the Democrats,” Kennedy said. Kennedy’s potential inclusion on the ballot means he could still play spoiler in Nevada’s expected nail-biter of a presidential race. While his polling has taken a hit since President Joe Biden exited the race last month, he is stillpolling at around5 percent in the Silver State, a margin large enough to affect the results. State and national surveys have tended to show Kennedy’s presence on ballots helping Vice President Kamala Harris more than former President Donald Trump. It also serves as an ironic coda to the monthslong legal saga related to Kennedy’s ballot access in the Silver State. His initial ballot petition was consideredinvalidfor not including a running mate, as required under Nevada law — which his campaign saidamounted to corruptionbecause it was operating on faulty advice from the secretary of state’s office — and his campaign is still engaged in a now effectively mootlawsuitrelated to that decision. Its second petition wasrescindedafter misspelling “United States” and the third petition gathered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, which the campaigncelebratedas having defeated an “attempt to block ballot access in Nevada.” The Nevada Democratic Party has led an effort to kick Kennedy off the ballot on the grounds that his affiliation with other political parties violates the state’s legal requirements for independent candidates. At the time of the lawsuit, Kennedy was a registered Democrat in New York (he now has no party affiliation) and is running as a member of a third party in a host of other states. A hearing on that case was held Thursday. A ruling was not issued, but District Court Judge James Russell asked the parties whether the case should be rendered moot given Kennedy’s campaign suspension. Kennedy, the environmental lawyer nephew of John F. Kennedy who rose to prominence for promoting anti-vaccine conspiracies during the pandemic, has run a freewheeling independent campaign for president after initially running as a Democrat last year. He made two stops in Las Vegas, one at aFebruary rallyand theotherat the annual FreedomFest conference, which is billed as the ""world's largest gathering of free minds.” Updated at 11:20 a.m. on 8/23/24 to include details from the hearing on the lawsuit to kick Kennedy off the ballot and at 12:15 p.m. on 8/23/24 to include details on Kennedy's campaign suspension.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-nevada-colleges-and-universities-are-encouraging-students-to-vote,True,"Nearlyone out of every four votersin Nevada’s 2022 midterm elections was younger than 29 — highlighting the importance of young voters in the swingy Silver State even as they have adisproportionately low turnout ratecompared to other age groups. That’s why several higher education institutions in the state, including UNR and Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC), are launching programs this fall that aim to increase turnout and make it easier for college students to vote. At UNR, campus officials are working to make it easier for students who live in dormitories to vote. Since the United States Postal Service doesn't deliver to residence halls, students can use addresses listed on the university’s Center for Student Engagement’swebsiteto register to vote and receive their mail ballots. UNR dorms have a capacity of more than 3,100 students. Dillon Moss, the director of government affairs at the Associated Students of the University of Nevada, said university officials are hoping to again have an on-campus polling site for the general election and that his department in student government is working to have employees trained to help students register to vote. “We want to engage [students] in a fun way so they get a positive experience out of engaging civically and democratically with the process,” he said. TMCC’s Student Government Association (SGA) is also working on a similar initiative to educate students and help register them to vote. The community college’s goal for the 2024 election is for at least 50 percent of students to vote, and for at least 55 percent of students to vote by 2026. “[We’ve] got a couple of really wonderful instructors in history and political science that will be talking about the importance of voting, they'll talk about some of the issues and try to present facts in a way that's not biased. They're just trying to encourage votes and help students understand what they're voting for,” TMCC President Karin Hilgersom said. TMCC is also working to again become a polling station site for the 2024 election. “College is the perfect place to not just encourage but to learn about the issues. That's what higher education is all about — we really are the cornerstone of what constitutes a civil and engaged society. [Our job is to] raise graduates who are really well equipped to be part of their region, their communities, their society,” Hilgersom said. At UNLV, university officials havepartnered with TurboVote— a service that aims to make it easier to register to vote or update registration, and to receive election reminders — and offer it to all students and staff. TurboVote offers free pre-addressed and postmarked envelopes for any election-related paperwork that needs to be mailed. UNR, TMCC and UNLV are all consideredvoter-friendly campuses. Voting in college With a sizable population of out-of-state students, it’s important to know the rules around who can cast a ballot in Nevada. University students are entitled to vote in Nevada as long as they have been a resident of the state for at least 30 days before the election, be 18 years of age by or on Election Day and be a U.S. citizen. Students attending a Nevada university or college from another state can vote in the state’s elections, as long as they have a permanent residence in the state and don’t intend to vote in their home state. They need to register eitheronlineor in-person and follow the steps set out for all voters. Out-of-state students who wish to cast an absentee ballot in their home state’s election are also allowed to do so, depending onindividual state rules and policiesfor absentee ballots.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nv-supreme-court-declines-to-weigh-in-after-washoe-county-recount-controversy,True,"The Nevada Supreme Court has denied a request to compel the Washoe County Commission to certify the June primary recount results, opting not to issue an advisory opinion that could provide more legal guidance on the role of county commissions in canvassing elections. In a Monday order, the Supreme Court judges wrote that the “matter is moot” because the commission voted 4-1 to certify the election results after the initial writ was filed. The court’s role is not to render advisory opinions, the judges wrote, adding that while they can weigh in on “a matter of widespread importance capable of repetition,” this case did not clear that judicial bar. “While we agree the issue is important and perhaps capable of repetition, petitioner's argument that the issue is evading review falls flat,” the order read. “Should the Washoe County Board of County Commissioners refuse to canvass election results again in the future, petitioner may seek relief on an expedited basis.” Thepetition, filed by the attorney general on behalf of the secretary of state, followed anunprecedentedvote by Washoe County Commissioners not to certify the June primary recount results. Three of the commission's Republican members voted not to certify the election, while the two Democratic members voted in opposition. The commissionlater votedto certify the recount, with one Republican in opposition. In late July, the court had issued a show cause order asking the state to provide arguments why the matter should not be dismissed as moot. In a filing, attorneys for the state suggested that the issue would likely arise again in the November election and that an advisory opinion would answer a question with “high precedential value.” Attorney General Aaron Ford said in a Tuesday statement that while he respects the Supreme Court’s decision, he strongly believes that “legal uncertainty in this matter contributes to unfounded distrust in our elections.” In a separate statement, Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said he is “hopeful that the Court will do the right thing should we find ourselves in a worst case scenario, but it's disappointing that we have to wait for a true crisis to have this matter heard.” The decision arrives as electionexpertsfear that conspiracy theories on massive voter fraud translating into what happened in Washoe could be a precursor to other similar attempts in Nevada. Read more: After Washoe recount and revote, experts say commission’s action undermined democracy Nevada lawspecifies that a recount must be conducted in the same manner as the original vote tabulation. Any losing candidate can seek a recount, but state law requires them to front the cost and receive a refund only if the recount changes the outcome in their favor. Recounts can be requested within three working days of the county or statewide canvass and must start within five days of receiving the demand. A recount must be completed within five days once it has commenced. Nevada Administrative Codeoutlines counties' statutory obligation to certify election results, specifying that any recount election “must be canvassed within 5 working days after the completion of the recount.” Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, toldThe Nevada Independentin July that although Nevada law clearly states that counties have an obligation to certify the votes, the consequences of not doing so are unclear. In a Tuesday statement, he said he understood the legal basis for the high court’s decision but warned that it could lead to Nevada serving as a national focal point for certification issues come November. “We have warned of this over and over and will be prepared to take action when this likely arises again in November,” Haseebullah said. “But certification issues throughout Nevada are about to make the paper ballot/hand counting issues of 2022 seem like a distant memory.” This story was updated on 8/20/2024 at 3:11 p.m. to include statements from Attorney General Aaron Ford and Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar and again at 3:40 p.m. to include a statement from Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of ACLU Nevada.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-will-campaign-across-the-country-this-week-as-he-struggles-to-adjust-to-harris,True,"By Jill Colvin, Associated Press BEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) — As Democrats kick off their convention in Chicago,Donald Trump's campaign is trying to regain its footing after weeks of struggling to adjust to Vice PresidentKamala Harrisat the top of the opposing ticket. Trump will attempt to undercut the Democratic celebration with a jam-packed schedule that includes daily events in battleground states tied to subjects where Republicans think they hold an advantage. It's his busiest campaign week since the winter, when he faced challengers in the Republican primary. But when Trump has held events billed as policy speeches throughout the campaign, they have often resembled his usual, rambling rally remarks. And as has long been the case during his political career, Trump has undercut his own message with outbursts and attacks that drown out anything else. The former president and Republican nominee has appeared at times in denial about the reality that Harris, and not PresidentJoe Biden, is now his rival. He's launched deeply personal attacks, lied about her crowds by claiming images of them were generated by AI, and played on racist tropes by questioning her racial identity as she runs to become the country’s first Black female and first South Asian president. The outbursts have alarmed allies, who worry Trump is damaging his chance in what they believe is an eminently winnable race. Privately and publicly, they have urged him to focus on policy instead of personality, and to do more to broaden his appeal with swing voters as they grow more nervous about Harris’ competitiveness. “If you have a policy debate for president, he wins,"" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press.” “Donald Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election.” Trump is scheduled to appear on Monday in Pennsylvania to talk about the economy and energy, on Tuesday in Michigan to talk about crime and safety, and on Wednesday in North Carolina to talk about national security at a joint appearance with his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. On Thursday, he'll travel to the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona to talk about immigration before going Friday to Arizona and Nevada. Graham said he wanted Trump to focus on what he would do on the economy and the U.S.-Mexico border, arguing, “Policy is the key to the White House.” Some people at his rallies agreed with that advice. “He needs to quit talking about Biden other than Harris piggybacking on those policies,” said Kory Jeno, a 53-year-old from Swannanoa, North Carolina, who was waiting to see Trump speak last week in nearby Asheville. “He needs to keep the conversation on the issues and what he’s going to do for Americans instead of running off on tangents where he’s just bashing her and that sort of thing.” The challenge for Republicans was on display last Thursday, when Trump invited reporters to his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, to talk about the economy. As he stood before an assortment of grocery store items, Trump largely stuck to his intended message during the first half-hour, talking about rising prices and blaming Biden and Harris for enacting policies he blamed for spiking inflation. He was unusually diplomatic, including in responding to criticism from former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who said last week that Trump should be spending his time working to appeal to suburban women, college-educated voters, independents, moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats instead of his base. “I want this campaign to win. But the campaign is not going to win talking about crowd sizes. It’s not going to win talking about what race Kamala Harris is. It’s not going to win talking about whether she’s dumb,” Haley said. But Trump didn't take Haley's advice when asked separately whether he needed to run a more disciplined campaign and pivot away from personal attacks against Harris. “I’m angry at her,” he said. “I think I’m entitled to personal attacks. I don’t have a lot of respect for her. I don’t have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she’ll be a terrible president.” He then gave Democrats new fodder at an event later that night with Miriam Adelson, the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson who is expected to spend tens of millions of dollars helping Trump regain the White House. As he described giving her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian award, he said it was “much better” than the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military honor. “Everyone who gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, that’s soldiers, they’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets, or they’re dead,” Trump told an audience. “She gets it, and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman.” The comment was immediately blasted by the Harris campaign and by some veterans as disrespectful to service members, just as Trump and Vance have tried to raise doubts about the National Guard record of Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. On Saturdayat a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump repeatedly swerved from a message focused on the economy to personal attacks against Harris, including a declaration that he is “much better looking” than she is. Trump's struggles come after an extraordinary stretch that has completely upended the campaign. Just one month ago, Republicans gathered at their national convention in Milwaukee were elated about their chances. Trump had justsurvived an assassination attemptand was being hailed by his most ardent supporters as a messiah-like figure protected by God to save the nation. Biden, his opponent, was facing growing pressure from his party to exit the race after a disastrous debate performance in which he struggled at times to complete sentences. His campaign signaled it would pull back from Sun Belt states like Arizona and Georgia that it had flipped from Trump four years ago. But just three days after the Republican convention closed, Biden ended his bid and endorsed Harris, who quickly aligned the party behind her. Some polls show Harris performing better than Biden in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, though most still suggest a tight race. “We just watched a rocket ship take off with Kamala Harris,” Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio said during a briefing with reporters earlier this month, pointing to a wave of media that, for a rare moment, eclipsed the attention Trump generates. About half of U.S. adults — 48 percent — have a very or somewhat favorable view of Harris, according to a new poll fromThe Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That's somewhat better than the 41 percent of adults who say they have a favorable opinion of Trump. The former president’s advisers remain bullish about his chances. They insist that Harris and Democrats are caught up in a fleeting moment of excitement with their new nominee, and are confident voters will sour on the vice president as they learn more about her past comments and positions. They intend to spend the race's final stretch painting her as a liberal extremist and contrasting the candidates' differing approaches on the economy, crime and immigration. “President Trump has continued to speak about sky-high inflation that has crushed American families, an out-of-control border that threatens every community, and rampant crime while Kamala Harris continues to hide from the press,” said Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung, adding that Trump “will be barnstorming battleground states all across the country to prosecute the case against a weak, failed and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris.” In Asheville, North Carolina, where Trump used an event billed as a major economic speech to go on tangents about Harris’ laugh and Biden’s son Hunter, 75-year-old Mary Ray said Trump “needs to stop the personal attacks.” Asked whether she was referring to Trump’s most incendiary comments — calling Harris a “nasty woman” and questioning how she discusses her biracial heritage — Ray furrowed her brow and pursed her lips. “It hurts him with other voters,"" Ray said. ___ Associated Press writers Michelle L.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-question-3-would-see-ranked-choice-voting-open-primaries-in-nevada,True,"Voters this November will have an opportunity to vote on a ballot measure that would fundamentally change Nevada’s election system. The measure, Question 3, would change the Nevada Constitution in two big ways — it would allow all voters to participate in primaries regardless of party affiliation and implement ranked-choice voting in general elections. It’s the second time Question 3 will appear before voters after it narrowly passed in the 2022 election. Read below for specific details on what the ballot measure would do, who supports it and how much it would cost. Summary of what it does:Question 3would require most partisan elections in Nevada to move to a ranked-choice voting system, excluding presidential and local government elections but affecting contests for U.S. Senate and congressional races, legislative elections and statewide office positions. If passed, primary elections in the state would open up to all voters regardless of party registration starting in 2026, with the top five vote-getters (regardless of their political party) advancing to the general election. Nevada currently operates under a “closed primary” system, where only registered voters of the same political party can participate in a primary and, thus, help determine who moves on to the general election. Registered nonpartisans or people affiliated with minor political parties do not get to vote in most contests on the primary ballot. At the general election, voters would rank candidates by order of preference. Voters could mark as many as five preferences among candidates but could also choose to rank only one candidate or any number less than five. Under this system, any candidate who receives a majority of the votes (more than 50 percent) would be declared the winner. If no candidate wins a majority, the candidate with the fewest first-preference votes would be eliminated and their votes would be redistributed to the candidates listed as voters’ second preference. This shuffling and vote reallocation process would continue until one candidate reaches a majority. Votes for “none of these candidates” would be required to be calculated, reported and made public, but would not be otherwise counted to elect or rank any candidates for partisan office. Nevada law dictates the ballot order. If Question 3 passes, the Nevada ballot would list the ticket as president (unranked and by party), federal and state partisan races (ranked), local government races (unranked and by party) and nonpartisan (unranked). On a given ballot, a voter would switch between the traditional and ranked-choice voting methods. Read more: Indy Explains: Question 3, open primaries and ranked-choice voting How did we get here?:The ballot question is formally known as theBetter Voting Nevada Initiative. Its journey began in November 2021, when Nevada Voters First, a political action committee,filed the initiative petitionseeking a constitutional amendment to make the proposed election changes. TheInstitute for Political Innovation, a nonprofit founded by author and philanthropist Katherine M. Gehl, financiallybackedthe measure. Gehl pioneered the concept of “final-five voting,” which is what the ballot question would implement in Nevada. For a breakdown of how “final-five” ranked choice voting works, watch this explainer: What is Question 3 on the Nevada 2022 ballot? Survivinga legal challenge, the measure passed in November 2022 with the support of about 53 percent of voters, despiteopposition from prominent elected leadersof both major parties. Though Nevada Voters First filed the initial initiative petition,organizers registereda new PAC,Vote Yes on 3, Inc., with the secretary of state’s office March 15, 2024. Representatives of the new PAC said everything will be branded “Vote Yes on 3” for the 2024 campaign. What have other states done?:Maine and Alaskaarethe only two states that have adopted ranked-choice voting for statewide elections, and some municipalities have also adopted the system — including New York City. Maine votersadopteda ranked-choice voting system for state and federal primary elections and general congressional elections in 2016, implementing and using the system in 2018. The state started using ranked-choice voting in presidential general elections in 2020 and the presidential primaries starting in 2024. Voters in Alaskaadoptedranked-choice voting in 2020 and began using it in 2022 for all state and federal general elections. In 2020, Democratic parties in Hawaii, Alaska, Kansas and Wyoming and early voters in Nevada used ranked-choice voting in their presidential primaries. The arguments in favor:Supporters say Question 3 would allow more people to participate in the election process, especially as the state’s share of nonpartisan voters grows. Since 2023, nonpartisans haveoutnumbered registered Democrats and Republicansin the state, making them Nevada’s largest group of registered voters. Advocates argue that allowing nonpartisan voters to weigh in during primaries could potentially temper the success of more extremist candidates, while giving nonpartisan voters a greater voice and allowing candidates who appeal to a broad audience to advance to the general elections. “Under Question 3, the need to pick the ‘lesser of two evils’ in the general election is something that Nevada voters will never have to contend with again,” A’Esha Goins, the founder of Black Joy Consulting and the outreach director for the Yes on 3 campaign, wrote in aDecember op-ed. Sondra Cosgrove, a professor at the College of Southern Nevada who has advocated for the measure as a volunteer, toldThe Nevada Independentthat voters are tired of political parties controlling election options, but the ballot question would solve the issue of voters fearing a spoiler effect if they support their preferred, but less likely to win, candidate. “Ranked choice voting’s instant runoff feature gives us more choices in the general election without splitting the vote and electing someone most of us did not want,” Cosgrove said. In response to criticism that ranked-choice voting is confusing for voters, proponents of the ballot measure have said there is plenty of time to educate voters about the changes given that it wouldn’t go into effect until the 2026 election. The arguments against:Nevada’s two Democratic senators — Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen — havesharply criticized the proposalas confusing for voters, warning the process could lead to errors that cause eligible votes to be thrown out. Other top officials who oppose the proposalincludeRep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), state Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) and Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas). The Nevada GOP and Nevada Democratic Party also oppose the ballot measure. Nevada Policy Research Institute, a conservative policy research organization, has also opposed the measure, publishing an opinion piece last yeararguingthat ranked-choice voting leads to delays in ballot tabulation, among other issues. Alongside elected officials, several nonpartisan and left-leaning groups have opposed the initiative. The Let Nevadans Vote coalition, which includes representatives from more than 20 groups, including Silver State Voices and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, has denounced the measure and argued that the system could lead to confusion about how to vote and how votes will be tabulated for those who are casting a ballot for the first time or who do not speak English as their first language. The Nevada State AFL-CIO also declared itsopposition to the initiative. Primary funders:Almost all of the money supporting Nevada Voters First in 2022 came fromout-of-state donors, led by a $5 million contribution from Gehl. Alongside Gehl, the group alsogarnered financial supportfrom the Realtors, a teachers union and the gaming industry. Other major contributors included: In its firstofficial finance reportsince its formation, the new pro Question 3 PAC reported more than $5.7 million in donations, $4 million of which came fromArticle IV, a nonpartisan organization focused on Democracy based in Arlington, Virginia. Another $1.5 million came from Unite America, a venture fund in Colorado supporting election reform, and $250,000 came from Wynn Resorts. Financial impact:Theimplementationof ranked-choice voting would cost approximately $3.2 million ahead of the 2026 general election, as well as an additional $57,000 per year moving forward,per a financial analysis of the ballot measureconducted by Legislative Counsel Bureau fiscal staff in 2022. The two-page fiscal report does not break down individual costs, but said expenses would be driven by “voter outreach and education, increased ballot stock costs, personnel expenses, equipment, software and programming costs for voting machines and updates to training materials.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-harris-leads-trump-among-nevada-latino-voters,True,"Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald Trump by 18 percentage points (53 percent to 35 percent) among Nevada Latino voters, according to a new poll from the media firm Entravision that shows the Democratic nominee shoring up her support with a key voting bloc. The survey, released Wednesday, found that Harris is viewed favorably by nearly all Latino demographics groups in Nevada. Sixty two percent of respondents said she has a better chance than President Joe Biden at defeating Trump, though Trump is slightly favored (34 percent to 32 percent) among self-described independent Latino voters. It’s the second poll this week to find Harriswinning overmore Nevada Latino voters than Biden, after the presidentdropped out of the racein July facing pressure from sagging poll numbers and a faltering debate performance. Harris was favored by 51 percent of Nevada Latinos surveyed with a positive approval rating (+13) — higher than the approval ratings for Biden (-7) and Trump (-13). The poll, fielded from July 24th to Aug. 6th in collaboration with BSP Research, surveyed 800 registered voters across Nevada and South Texas, 400 of which were in Nevada. It was conducted online in both English (80 percent) and Spanish (20 percent) with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points. Making up roughly one in five of the state’s eligible voters, Latino voters are a crucial voting bloc in the state, but withnearly halfregistered as independents, they are an especially “persuadable electorate,” said Marcelo Gaete, Entravision’s Executive Vice President of Public and Governmental Affairs. Entravision owns Univision affiliates in both Las Vegas and Reno. Nearly 50 percent of Nevada Latinos have changed their mind on a candidate after watching an ad, and more than half said they do not have all the information they need to make their vote this November, according to the poll. Latino voters’ top issues this cycle — like other demographic groups —  are economic concerns, principally inflation, the economy, and health care costs, the poll found. Project 2025 —  a proposed policy agenda for the next Republican presidential administration   — is  among Latino’s largest concerns about Trump’s candidacy. A majority of Nevada Latinos surveyed (55 percent) say that Trump should not be elected due to his role in the January 6th insurrection. But Trump’s platform is attractive to a sizable chunk of those surveyed. Forty four percent of those surveyed agreed that Trump would be better on border security and on immigration than Harris, and another 46 percent said he would be better on economic issues. The Trump campaign has blamed Harris for the surge in border crossings, and labeled her as the Biden administration's “border czar.” A plurality of poll respondents (44 percent) said Trump — who has pledged todeport millions of peoplenot legally in the country — agreed that he will “bring safety to our border and solve the immigration crisis.” The Entravision poll found 53 percent of Latinos support Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) compared to 22 percent in favor of Republican candidate Sam Brown. Interparty support may play a role — 60 percent of Latino Republicans say they are voting for Brown versus the 85 percent of Democrats who say they will vote for Rosen. About a quarter of Latinos remain undecided about the U.S. Senate race. “Nevada is right at the center of the political universe in 2024,” Gaete said. “Because it is such a crucial state, Latinos are pivotal in both determining who the next president will be and determining who can hold the majority in the Senate and in the House.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/harris-unveils-policy-proposals-to-address-affordable-housing-crisis,True,"Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled her housing policy plan Thursday that includes a pledge to construct three million new housing units in her first term as president and to create an expanded version of down payment assistance for homebuyers. The Democratic presidential nominee’s plan, shared withThe Nevada IndependentandThe Wall Street JournalThursday afternoon, seeks to address housing shortages and soaring rental prices — building off plans pushed by President Joe Biden by calling for more home construction and greater financial relief for homeowners. It also calls for federal lawmakers to pass stalled legislation seeking to address the rise of corporate housing purchases. Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are rolling out their policy planks during an accelerated campaign after Biden stepped down from the top of the Democratic ticket last month and immediately endorsed Harris. On Friday, Harris is expected tounveilthe campaign’s economic policy platform. Notably, the housing plan did not include anycalls to free up federal land for affordable housing development, a topic that is a rare source of agreement for Nevada’s Democratic congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. Some housing advocates have argued that simply providing land is not enough to address the state’s housing crisis, especially in a state where expanding outward requires additional, often costly, infrastructure. Prior to Harris’ rise as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, Biden hadembracedhousing language on the campaign trail —holdinga housing-focused event in Las Vegas earlier this year that underscored his commitment to the issue in a swing statewith a particularly acute housing crisis. The National Low Income Housing Coalitionestimatesthat Nevada is nearly 80,000 affordable rental homes short of meeting the needs of extremely low-income renters — those who are at or below the federal poverty guideline or earn less than 30 percent of the area median income. The average home sale price in the state hasrisen dramaticallysince the pandemic, from about $300,000 in 2019 to nearly $460,000 today — one of the main cost of living challenges that have votersfeeling pessimisticabout an economy that metrics show is generally strong. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign also includes aplanto address housing affordability — calling for reducing mortgage rates to help new home buyers, transferring federal land for home construction, offering tax incentives for homeowners and first-time homebuyers and cutting “unnecessary regulations that raise housing costs.” Construction of new housing units To aid in the construction of 3 million new units — 1 million more than Biden pledged in his 2024 State of the Union address — Harris plans to establish a new tax incentive for building starter homes sold to first-time buyers. Her policy plan also calls upon expanding existing tax incentives for new housing development — an action the Biden-Harris administration also proposed — and establishing a new federal housing innovation fund. The fund would be about $40 billion, twice what was proposed under Biden. However, in differentiating the innovation fund proposal, Harris’ campaign says the money would “empower local governments to fund local solutions to build housing.” Down payment assistance Congressional Democrats havetried to passlegislation providing down payment assistance worth up to $25,000 to first-generation home buyers, which are people whose parents did not own a home, but those efforts have stalled whileother Democratshave pushed for more expanded relief. Under the campaign’s proposal released Thursday, the down payment assistance would be expanded to include families who have paid their rent on time for two years and are buying their first home. The campaign estimated this would benefit more than one million home buyers annually. The plan also called for “more generous support for first-time home buyers” but did not elaborate. “Many Americans work hard at their jobs, save, and pay their rent on time month after month. But they can’t save enough after paying their rent and other bills to save for a down payment—denying them a shot at owning a home and building wealth,” the campaign said in an announcement. “This plan will significantly simplify and expand the reach of down-payment assistance.” Reducing rental prices The campaign’s efforts to lower rent prices revolve around pushing for existing legislation to crack down on policies benefiting corporate investors and major landlords. The plan calls for Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act,legislationthat would prohibit investors who acquire 50 or more new single-family rental homes from deducting interest or depreciation on the properties. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) introduced thebillin April, but it has stalled in the Senate. The issue of cracking down on predatory investing is well-known in Nevada, where Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) has repeatedly called for crack downs on corporate investors buying up limited housing stock, thereby driving up rents and squeezing out potential first-time home buyers. Following the 2008 Great Recession, and again after the COVID-19 pandemic, private equity firms and subsidieshave floodedNevada’s single-family housing market. Ascash prices have reigned supreme, data from the real estate website Redfin shows that 75 percent of homes were purchased with cash across the country in2021, giving more power to larger, corporate investors and leading to more cries from advocatesfor reform measures. To address these calls for reform, the campaign said it supports for the passage of the Preventing the Algorithmic Facilitation of Rental Housing Cartels Act, a Senate billintroducedin January that aims to crack down on companies that allow landlords to collude to set high housing prices via software and price-setting algorithms. “Corporate landlords are using private equity-backed price-setting tools to jack up rents dramatically in communities across the country,” the Thursday announcement said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-harris-winning-back-nevada-latino-voters-who-soured-on-biden-trump,True,"Vice President Kamala Harris is outperforming President Joe Biden by 12 percentage points among registered Hispanic voters in Nevada, but still lags behind his 2020 level of support with Hispanic voters, according to a new poll from the Democratic firm Equis Research. The firm’s report,released Wednesday, found that Harris has had the most success in pulling back support from Nevada Latinos who held an unfavorable view of both Biden and former President Donald Trump. The poll found Harris leading Trump by 19 percentage points among registered Hispanic voters in the seven battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — a 14 percentage point swing from Biden’s lead over Trump among those same voters in the firm’s last poll. “We found that the shift in support cuts across ideology,” Maria Di Franco Quinonez, a research director at Equis, said in an interview on Wednesday. “Liberal, moderate and conservative voters are supporting Harris at higher rates than they were previously supporting Biden.” Making up roughly one in five of the state’s eligible voters, Latino voters are a crucial voting bloc in the state. But a memorandum accompanying the Equis poll found that even though Harris’ support among Latino voters is about 5 percentage points shy of 2020 levels in Nevada, she has “some wiggle room if non-Latino support levels remain relatively stable.” Equis’ report, released Wednesday, is the first major poll of Latinos since Harris became the Democratic nominee. The poll was conducted July 22 and Aug. 4 via phones and web-to-text in English and Spanish with 2,183 registered voters who identify as Latino or Hispanic across 12 battleground states, including Nevada. The margin of error is 2.9 percent for the full, 12-state sample, and 3.7 percent for individual state results. Harris has been aggressively campaigning in the Sun Belt, finishing off a tour of battleground states this weekend in Las Vegas. Herrally on Saturdayattracted more than 12,000 attendees, making it one of the largest political rallies in modern Nevada political history Up until now, Latino support for Democrats in Nevada has been less clear-cut, especially in comparison toother minority groups. In June, 33 percent of registered Latino voters in Nevada “definitely” supported Biden and 30 percent definitely supported Trump, according to a poll from TelevisaUnivision.In 2020, exit polling indicated more than a third of Nevada Latinos voted for Trump, signaling that Republicansupport among the demographic group is growing. While Democrats have hoped that they could continue to rally Latino support with a more liberal immigration platform,multiple surveyssignal that Latinos are warming to more stringent immigration measures and increasingly trust the GOP to handle the issue. The Trump campaign has made Harris’ role in investigating border crossings a focal point of his attacks by labeling her as the administration's “border czar,” and blaming her for a surge in border crossings. But, Di Franco Quinonez says that such messaging falls “a bit flat.” Some of Equis’ latest polling shows that Trump’s more stringent immigration policies — in particular theidea of mass deportations—  are viewed very unfavorably among Latino voters, especially those that are undecided.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/why-trumps-and-harris-proposals-to-end-federal-taxes-on-tips-would-be-difficult-to-enact,True,"By Dee-Ann Durbin, AP Business Writer Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris agree on one thing, at least: Both say they want to eliminate federal taxes on workers’ tips. But experts say there’s a reason Congress hasn’t made such a change already. It would be complicated, not to mention enormously costly to the federal government, to enact. It would encourage many higher-paid workers to restructure their compensation to classify some of it as “tips” and thereby avoid taxes. And, in the end, it likely wouldn’t help millions of low-income workers. “There’s no way that it wouldn’t be a mess,” said James Hines Jr., a professor of law and economics and the research director of the Office of Tax Policy Research at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Both candidates unveiled their plans in Nevada, a state with one of the highest concentrations of tipped service workers in the country. Trumpannounced a proposalto exclude tips from federal taxes on June 9. Harrisannounced a similar proposalon Aug. 10. Details have been sparse. Neither candidate's team has said whether it would exempt tips only from income taxes, only from payroll taxes or both. The payroll tax funds Social Security and Medicare. Harris’ campaign has said she would work with Congress to draft a proposal that would include an income limit and other provisions to prevent abuses by wealthy individuals who might seek to structure their compensation to classify certain fees as tips. Her campaign said these requirements, which it did not specify, would be intended “to prevent hedge fund managers and lawyers from structuring their compensation in ways to try to take advantage of the policy.” Trump's campaign has not said whether its proposal would include any such requirements. Even so, Hines suggested that millions of workers — not just wealthy ones — would seek to change their compensation to include tips, and could even do so legally. For example, he said, a company might set up a separate entity that would reward its employees with tips instead of year-end bonuses. “You will have taxpayers pushing their attorneys to try to characterize their wage and salary income as tips,” Hines said. “And some would be successful, inevitably, because it’s impossible to write foolproof rules that will cover every situation."" Republican supporters of Trump argue that Hines' concerns are overblown. Darin Miller, a spokesman for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said the Internal Revenue Service has a precise definition for tips and contended that reclassifying wages would be considered fraud. Miller noted that some Democrats have signed on to co-sponsor a bill Cruz introduced in June that would exempt tips from federal income taxes. A bill exempting tips from payroll and income taxes has also been introduced in the House. Though supporters say the measures are designed to help low-wage workers, many experts say that making tips tax-free would provide only limited help to those workers. The Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research center, estimates that there were 4 million U.S. workers in tipped occupations in 2023. That amounted to about 2.5 percent of all employees, including restaurant servers and beauticians. Tipped workers tend to be younger, with an average age of 31, and of lower income. The Budget Lab said the median weekly pay for tipped workers in 2023 was $538, compared with roughly $1,000 for non-tipped workers. As a result, many tipped workers already bear a lower income-tax burden. In 2022, 37 percent of tipped workers had incomes low enough that they paid no federal income tax at all, The Budget Lab said. “If the issue is you’re concerned about low-income taxpayers, there are a lot better ways to address that problem, like expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit or changing tax rates or changing deductions,” Hines said. In her speech in Nevada, Harris also called for raising the federal minimum wage. (The platform on Trump’s campaign site doesn’t mention the minimum wage.) Changing federal tax policy on tips would also be costly. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan group, estimates that exempting all tip income from federal income and payroll taxes would reduce revenue by $150 billion to $250 billion between 2026 and 2035. And it said that amount could rise significantly if the policy changed behavior and more people declared tip income. Whether Trump or Harris wins the presidential election, tax policy will be high on Congress’ agenda in 2025. That’s because Trump-era tax cuts, passed in 2017, are set to expire. But Hines said he thinks Congress will be in no hurry to add “vast amounts of complexity” to the tax code. “A presidential candidate can say whatever they want, but it's the House and Senate that have to do it,” he said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-posts-big-lead-over-brown-in-latest-nevada-senate-poll,True,"A new poll of likely Nevada voters shows Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) with a 12 percentage point lead ahead of her Republican opponent Sam Brown. Rosen received 51.7 percent of support in the poll, while Brown received 39.7 percent. Another 2.8 percent of respondents indicated they would vote for another candidate, and the remaining 5.8 percent said they would support none of the candidates. Though Rosen hasconsistently ledBrown since he announced his bid for Senate, the poll released by Republican political strategist Woodrow Johnston and Decipher Ai’s David Wolfson, a pollster and Columbia University lecturer, is one of the best polls for Rosen this cycle. The poll sampled 991 likely Nevada voters from Aug. 3-5 using SMS and text-to-web. The statewide margin of error is 3 percentage points. The same poll showed Vice President Kamala Harrisclosing the gapbetween herself and former President Donald Trump in the Silver State, leading her opponent by 6 percentage points. Johnston and Wolfson have consulted and worked for Republicans, but did not receive a commission. Johnston toldThe Nevada Independentthat he did not anticipate Rosen’s lead to be as wide as it was, but he attributed it partly to a “huge spending disparity” and Trump’s declining popularity. “When President Trump was leading in the polls, Capt. Brown was still consistently behind, now that President Trump has dropped, it appears Capt. Brown has dropped even lower,” Johnston said. “There appears to be a correlation at least. Both campaigns have in their communications anchored themselves somewhat to the top of their tickets.” Johnston said Brown and Trump still have time to make up for lost ground, noting that many voters choose their preferred candidate after Labor Day. “Most of the media attention has been on Vice President Harris ever since the switch was announced,” Johnston said. “President Trump appears to perform best under pressure; with the sentencing coming up Sept. 18, I expect his numbers to bounce back up.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/were-happy-again-harris-and-walz-bring-new-enthusiasm-to-presidential-race-in-nevada,True,"After watching President Joe Biden’s faltering debate performance in late June, 69-year-old retiree Mary Criswell said “the whole mood just went in the tank.” But six weeks later, Criswell was among the more than 12,000 people cheering on Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday during their first rally in Las Vegas since becoming the Democratic ticket for president. It was Criswell’s first time attending a political event since Barack Obama ran for re-election in 2012. “The energy level, the excitement, everybody's just so excited for her to be here,” Criswell said. Saturday’s rally — an hourslong affair at UNLV’s Thomas & Mack Center that was bigger (and louder) than any Nevada event held by Biden — captured the wave of enthusiasm that has supercharged the Harris campaign in recent weeks. In the first three weeks after Biden’s exit, the Harris campaign in Nevada recruited more than 10,500 volunteers, up from the roughly 2,500 volunteers recruited the three weeks prior. In that same period, the Harris campaign’s paid organizing program for high school students (which is predominantly Latino) saw a 1,400 percent increase in applications compared to the three weeks prior to Biden’s exit. And at Saturday’s rally — the biggest political event in Nevada in recent memory, even with about 4,000 people prevented entry for heat-related concerns — the campaign recruited more than 5,000 volunteer shift sign ups, the highest number of shift sign ups at any Harris campaign event to date, an official said. Of these sign ups, 1,000 were for events held Sunday. The momentum has shown up in other ways — Harris has posted better numbers in national and Nevada polls than Biden, and more elected officials are on board, with Nevada’s entire Democratic congressional delegation speaking at Saturday’s rally, which had not happened during Biden’s visits to Nevada this cycle. At aneventFriday at the Clark County Republican Party offices, Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald attacked Harris and Walz as being “the most liberal, dangerously liberal people ever to run for this office.” He accused Harris of being responsible for the surge in border crossings and called Walz “gutless” for his response in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. Many rally attendees who spoke withThe Nevada Independentsaid they typically aren’t active politically (some noted that this was their first political rally), but were excited enough about the Harris-Walz ticket to wait in the triple-digit heat for hours. The interviewees’ excitement did not arise from any specific policies, but rather centered around the potential for Harris to be the first female president, her ability to beat Trump and her background. The campaign has facedcriticismfor not releasing a policy platform, and Harris said it plans to release an economic platform in the coming days. Alexandra Freer, 35, said she wouldn’t have gone to a rally if Biden were still the Democratic nominee. As someone with volunteer experience, she said she thinks this energy is essential because it allows more people to specifically push for greater organizing in swing states such as Nevada. “It matters significantly in a campaign — how you rally, where you go and how you try to gain those independent voters, and those voters that are not Democrat but don't want to vote for Trump,” she said. That sentiment wasechoed on Xby Michelle White, a longtime Democratic political operative and former chief of staff to Gov. Steve Sisolak. “As someone who spent a good chunk of my career organizing events & rallies in NV, I can confirm that this is absolutely mind blowing,” she wrote in response to a video about the rally’s crowd size. “Vegas is notoriously difficult when it comes to building crowds.” When Biden was the Democratic nominee, some of Ibeth Soto’s friends were thinking of canceling their voter registration because they had no interest in voting, she said before Saturday’s rally. Now, the 23-year-old said she is finding it easier to convince her friends to vote, particularly because of Walz, who has been lauded by progressives for helping pass policies such asuniversal free school mealsandprotections for transgender youth. “Even convincing people to vote for [Biden] was like, ‘Oh just vote for him, because he’s not Trump,’” Soto said. “This, it has more points like, ‘Oh, she's so much younger than Trump. She has better things going on in Tim Walz.’” For a while, Michelle Tkacz, 49, said she became so disheartened with politics that she completely unplugged from social media. She only logged back on when she heard Biden wasn't going to run again, and was “shocked” (in a good way) after learning Harris had selected a fellow Midwesterner in Walz. “I feel he was a great pick,” Tkacz said. Laurie Solverson’s voice slightly shook as she reflected on the Harris campaign. Her father, who died last December, was a union member for the Teamsters. She said she thinks that if her father was still alive, he’d be ecstatic about the Democratic campaign. Solverson’s mom, who is in her 90s, is “also super happy,” she said. “It's affecting everyone,” she said. And for Kirk Anthony Ford, a 59-year-old educator, Saturday’s rally showed “we’re happy again in America.” Ford said he thinks part of the American identity was lost under Trump, especially after the Jan. 6 insurrection. While he greatly appreciated Biden — calling him the “greatest selfless leader of our generation — he, too, has noticed a change with Harris and Walz. “We're gonna get the culture back on track,” he said.",Error: Connection error.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-question-2-on-the-2024-nevada-ballot,True,"An estimated30 percentof Nevadans live with a disability related to cognitive, visual or auditory function. Advocates say that Question 2 on the 2024 ballot would update that antiquated language — that has been in the state’s governing charter since Nevada’s statehood in 1864 — to be more inclusive toward people with disabilities and their spectrum of needs. Summary of what it does:This ballot question would remove the terms “insane,” “deaf” and “dumb” from the Nevada Constitution, broadening the language so it applies to a wider range of people with disabilities. “Insane” would be replaced with “persons with significant mental illness”; “blind” to “persons who are blind or visually impaired”; and  “deaf and dumb” to “persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.” It would also replace the term “institutions” with “entities,” distancing itself from the term “institutionalized.” How did we get here:For the Legislature to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot, the amendment must first pass the Assembly and Senatein two consecutive legislative sessions. The amendment was introduced to the 2021 legislative session asAJR1, and passed unanimously in both chambers during the 2021 and 2023 legislative sessions, securing its place on the 2024 ballot. What have other states done?Other states have brought forward similar ballot questions or legal changes updating antiquated language related to people with disabilities in recent years. Michigan in 2014 approvedlegislationthat removed the terms “mentally retarded” and “mental retardation” from state statutes. North Dakota also has a proposedconstitutional amendmenton its 2024 ballot that would replace the terms “insane,” “deaf” and “dumb” with more inclusive language. Argument for passing Question 2:Question 2 receivedbroad supportfrom legislators and disability advocacy groups who said that the measure would help advance the rights of people with disabilities. State Sen. Robin Titus (R-Wellington), who sponsored the bill in 2021,said during a legislative hearing last year that different terminologies were used when the state Constitution was written nearly 160 years ago, but it was now an appropriate time to “to give these words a more critical look.” “We must do a better job in making sure we do not discriminate and stigmatize persons with disabilities or mental illness in our laws,” she saidduring a May 2023 legislative hearing. “A first step is to ensure none of this discriminative or derogatory language is in our Constitution.” Arguments against passing Question 2:There were no arguments against the measure presented during either legislative session. It twice passed unanimously in the Assembly and Senate. Ina summary of the ballot questionprepared by the secretary of state’s office, a section titled “Arguments Against Passage” says that amending the state Constitution “should be a rare occurrence” and that the language was acceptable at the time. “The Nevada Constitution is a historical document, and we should not expect it to keep pace with the ever-changing nature of language,” it reads. Primary funders:There were no political action committees registered to support or oppose the measure. Financial impact:The resolution’s fiscal note says that the Legislature has beenunableto determine the measure’s financial impact.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/harris-pledges-to-end-tax-on-tips-echoing-trump-in-massive-las-vegas-rally,True,"At one of the largest political rallies in modern Nevada political history, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz continued their barnstorming tour as the new Democratic presidential ticket on Saturday — one of the clearest signs yet of Democrats’ renewed hopes in the swing state. Campaign officials said more than 12,000 people attended the event at UNLV’s Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas — by far the biggest crowd for any campaign event in Nevada this election cycle. Local law enforcement prevented an additional 4,000 from entering the arena due to heat-related concerns. The rally marks the final stop on a weeklong tour of battleground states launched after Walz — the 60-year-old Minnesota governor and military veteran — was picked as Harris’ running mate last week. Nevada’s appearance on that campaign list was no mistake — Democrats are newly energized in their efforts to keep the Silver State blue after Harris replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket and seeing a corresponding surge in donations and poll numbers (including in Nevada). And it was in Nevada, amid the regular rhetoric of her campaign stump speech, that Harris made a new promise: to eliminate federal taxes on tips received by restaurant workers and others in the service industry. It marked a rare moment of political agreement — the idea wasfirst raisedby former President Donald Trump at his Nevada campaign rally in June andlater embracedby elected officials in the state, including Democrats. In apostto his Truth Social account Saturday, Trump accused Harris of copying his proposal, and that “she won’t do it, she just wants it for Political Purposes!” It’s a policy promise that was quickly lauded by the Culinary Union Workers Union Local 226, the politically powerful labor union that endorsed Harris and Walz late Friday ahead of their trip to the state. The union represents more than 60,000 workers in Reno and Las Vegas. As they have at other campaign events this past week, Harris and Walz touted their backgrounds — her as a prosecutor, attorney general and senator, him as a former teacher, National Guard member and congressman  — and outlined how their administration would protect people’s rights. Harris framed the election as an ideological struggle with Democrats pushing for “the future” and the Trump campaign stuck in “the past.” In response, the crowd chanted “we will not go back.” “If Donald Trump wants to pick a fight over our most fundamental freedoms, we say, bring it on,” Harris said. The excitement was evident among the more than 15 attendees interviewed byThe Nevada IndependentSaturday, many of whom said they felt more energetic and engaged with Harris leading the ticket and Walz by her side. The campaign recruited 4,300 volunteer shift sign-ups at the event, which was higher than any other prior rally, a campaign official said. Alexandra Freer, 35, said she wouldn’t have gone to a rally if Biden were the Democratic nominee. “I think he is a good guy in general, but we needed somebody new. I wasn’t very excited to vote for Joe,” Freer said. “It’s exciting. I’m way more excited.” Walz/Harris During her 27-minute speech, the vice president leaned into her record as a prosecutor, repeating a common phrase that she has used this week that she knows “Donald Trump’s type” through her record of prosecuting “predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain.” Harris highlighted access to abortion in her speech, saying Trump would sign a national abortion ban “but we are not going to let that happen because we trust women.” Walz told the story of his daughter — Hope — who was born as a result of  in vitro fertilization, a message implicitlycontrasting GOP oppositionto some fertility treatments. She also called the immigration system “broken” and pledged to pass a stalled Senate bill that would have beefed up Border Patrol funding and stop processing most asylum claims if the number of migrant encounters reaches a certain threshold. The billfailedafter Trump urged Republicans to oppose it. “He talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk,” Harris said of Trump. The rally marked Harris’ seventh appearance in Nevada this year — and by far the biggest — after previously stumping for Biden six times, including events to courtLatinoandAsian Americanvoters. Walz also made a brief stop in June to a Biden campaign field office in Reno. Unlike those previous visits, the scale of Saturday’s visit was unmistakably bigger. The state’s entire Democratic congressional delegation — Reps. Steven Horsford, Susie Lee and Dina Titus and Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto — preceded Harris and Walz, along with a casino porter and Culinary Union member as well as a campaign staffer from North Las Vegas. Saturday’s rally was also the first time many in Southern Nevada had a chance to hear Walz in person. Walz spent much of his speech outlining his background — he grew up in rural Nebraska and had 25 people in his graduating class, saying his parents taught him the importance of “generosity towards my neighbor and to work with the common good.” He highlighted his time serving on the House Armed Services Committee, during which he touted helping pass “the most extensive veterans package since the GI Bill” with Republican support. “I learned the art of compromising without compromising my values,” Walz said. He also leaned into the characterization of Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) as “weird” — a strategy he first deployed in a TV interview while vying to be Harris’ running mate that has since becomea focal pointof the campaign’s messaging. “Taking away reproductive freedoms, banning books, raising the price of insulin, trying to hurt labor unions, nobody’s asking for that weird crap,” Walz said. A campaign energized? Rochelle Jeter, said she could only think of one apt comparison to the level of enthusiasm she saw Saturday: Barack Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008. Jeter, 73, had not previously attended a political rally, but was among the first people who entered the Thomas & Mack Center, clad with a purple umbrella to protect her from the triple-digit heat. “I'm encouraged, and I pray that it'll continue,” she said. “I'm going to do what I can to contribute.” It’s comments like those from Jeter that have inspired more confidence among Democrats, especially given the surge of volunteer support and interest in the campaign in the immediate aftermath of Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race. But will this “Harrismentum” last until November? Polling has been relatively limited in Nevada so far, though ahandfulof pollsreleased since Biden left the race have shown a much closer contest. The Cook Political Report, a top election forecaster, this weekmovedNevada to a “toss up” after it previously leaned Republican. The state has not backed a Republican presidential candidatesince 2004, but the GOP has won other statewide contests and post-Obama margins of presidential victory in the state have grown increasingly slim. “This will be a tight race until the very end, and so let's not pay too much attention to the polls,” Harris said during her speech. Anne Yeh, a 75-year-old retired nurse, describes herself as a regular at political events, but described the energy she’s witnessed since the start of Harris’ campaign as unprecedented. “We're getting young people involved more,” said Yeh. “We're getting Black people involved. We've got women coming out of the woodwork. They're reaching the general public. ""For the first time, everybody doesn't have to be a CEO executive,” she said, citing Walz's background as a teacher and growing up on a farm. Lisa Agramonte, a 56-year-old teacher in Clark County, said Harris was the reason she showed up Saturday. “She's on fire,” she said. “I’m all for her.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-las-vegas-kamala-harris-sees-a-chance-to-improve-her-odds-of-winning,True,"By Rio Yamat and Josh Boak, Associated Press LAS VEGAS (AP) — Vice PresidentKamala Harrisis working to make Nevada look like less of a political gamble in November's election. The Democratic presidential nominee visits the state on Saturday with her running mate, Minnesota Gov.Tim Walz. It's the final stop of a battleground blitz in which Democrats are showing new energy after President Joe Bidenexited the raceand Harris replaced him at the top of the ticket. That new enthusiasm has enabled them to boost turnout efforts in swing states such as Nevada and Arizona, which Harris visited Friday. Magnolia Magat, a 59-year-old restaurant owner in Las Vegas who lives in the neighboring city of Henderson, said she’s now “more hopeful” about the election. “I am very happy that not only is our candidate a woman, she is Black and she’s also Asian,” said Magat, who is Filipino American. “And it’s not because Harris is a woman that I want to endorse her. It’s because she’s highly capable of running the country.” As part of the trip, Harris is hoping to build greater support among Latino voters. In 2020, Biden narrowly beat Republican Donald Trump by 2.4 percentage points in Nevada. Trump, the former president, is trying this time to create more support in a state that relies on the hotel, restaurant and entertainment industry by pledging to makeworkers' tips tax-free. But the union representing 60,000 workers in that industry, the Culinary Workers Union, announced Friday night its endorsement of Harris. About 54 percent of the union's members are Latino, 55 percent women and 60 percent immigrants. “The path to victory runs through Nevada,” the union said in a statement, “and the Culinary Union will deliver Nevada for President Kamala Harris and Vice President Tim Walz.” AP VoteCast found in 2020 that 14 percent of Nevada voters were Hispanic, with Biden winning 54 percent of their votes. His margin with Hispanic voters was slightly better nationwide, a sign that Democrats cannot take this bloc of voters for granted. Harris is hoping to drive a wedge with Republicans by focusing on issues such as access to abortion and repairs to the U.S. immigration system. Her message is that Trump killed a bipartisan deal this year to improve security on the southern border and address immigration issues, with Democrats saying he did so in hopes of improving his own political odds. Because Harris' portfolio in the Biden administration included the root causes of migration and due to some of her comments before the 2020 election, Republicans have sought to portray her as weak on the southern border and enabling illegal immigration. At a Thursday news conference, Trump said of Harris, “As a border czar, she's been the worst border czar in history, in the world history.” The Republican has proposed mass deportations if he returns to the White House, but AP VoteCast found in 2020 that nearly 7 in 10 Nevada voters said that immigrants living in the United States illegally should be offered the chance to apply for legal status. Harris and Walz over the past week have also visited the crucial midwestern “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Along with Nevada and Arizona, those five states represent 61 electoral votes that could be essential for reaching the 270 threshold required to win November's election. Harris had also planned to visit North Carolina and Georgia this past week — between them another 32 electoral votes — but those stops were postponed due to Tropical Storm Debby. In Nevada's rural Douglas County near the California border, Gail Scott, 71, serves on the central committee of the local Democratic Party and said she didn't initially agree with calls for Biden to leave the race. Trump won the county in 2016 and 2020, but trimming his margins there could lower his ability to compete in Nevada. Scott said it's impossible to miss the energy that Harris has created among younger voters who could help statewide. “Young people are embracing Kamala Harris and the enthusiasm and the joy that she’s brought to the campaign,” she said. Brian Shaw, a Republican from northern Nevada, said Harris’ arrival on the top of the ticket could make it harder for Trump to win because Biden was a “pitiful candidate” and there’s little time to expose the vice president’s “incompetence.” He said he attended Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s rally in Reno on July 30 and found him to be “likable, capable, polished as a politician, but not veneered.” He didn't have much of an opinion of Walz. ___ Boak reported from Washington.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/new-nevada-poll-sees-harris-with-biggest-lead-over-trump-yet,True,"A new poll of likely Nevada voters found Vice President Kamala Harris with a nearly 6 percentage point lead over former President Donald Trump — the largest lead for a Democrat in any presidential poll of Nevadans this cycle. While Nevada polls have been relatively scarce since Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, the vice president appears to haveclosed the gapthat existed between Trump and Biden, whohad not led Trumpin a single public poll taken in the state since October 2023. A Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll of Nevada in late July found Harris with a 2 percentage pointleadin the head-to-head matchup — Democrats’ first leading poll of the cycle — and the Cook Political ReportmovedNevada back into the “toss-up” category Thursday after previously categorizing it as “lean Republican.” This latest poll, conducted by Decipher Ai’s David Wolfson, a pollster and Columbia University lecturer, sampled 991 likely voters across Nevada from Aug. 3-5 in a SMS/text-to-web poll on the presidential and House races. The statewide margin of error is 3 percentage points and between 6 percentage points and 7 percentage points for House races. While Wolfson and political strategist Woodrow Johnston, who also worked on the poll, have been pollsters and consultants for Republicans, they received no commission for the poll. Wolfson and Johnston previously collaborated on a poll for the Nevada presidential primary race,correctly findingthat former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley would lose to the state’s “None of these candidates” option. On the presidential ballot, Harris garnered 49.2 percent support while Trump received 43.6 percent. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. received only 3.9 percent of the vote. Kennedy’svote shareis lower than the 8 percentage points to 10 percentage points he had been receiving, on average, when Biden was on the ballot. In an interview, Johnston said Kennedy’s polling fade reflects what typically happens to third-party candidates as the election nears. Harris’ lead in this poll may be an outlier, but it mimics Biden’s position at this point in the cycle in 2020 whenFiveThirtyEightpolling averagesshowedhe led in Nevada by about 6 percentage points. Biden ultimately won the state by about 2.4 percentage points. Johnston said Harris is riding a polling honeymoon since Biden dropped out — and that the poll reflects a more typical outcome for a Democratic nominee at this point in the cycle. “There's just been almost like a collective sigh of relief that Joe Biden is not going to be running and is not the nominee, that I honestly think that anyone would be polling as well at this point of the race,” he said. The poll also found Nevada’s three House Democrats leading in their re-election races — and Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) in a closer contest than he is used to. In Southern Nevada, Reps. Dina Titus (D-NV), Susie Lee (D-NV) and Steven Horsford (D-NV) led by margins close to the 6 percentage to 7 percentage point margins of error for their districts. In 2022, Lee had the closest race of the three, winning by 4 percentage points. But the poll found Horsford to be in the tightest race, with a lead of 4.3 percentage points over former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee. Horsford won in 2022 by 4.8 percentage points against Sam Peters, a relatively unknown Republican in a race that saw far less outside spending than Congressional Districts 1 and 3. Ultimately, all three seats remained in Democratic hands, and Republicans have been far morereluctantto spend in Southern Nevada — neither theNational Republican Congressional Committee(NRCC) norCongressional Leadership Fund(CLF) have made ad reservations in Las Vegas this cycle. But the NRCC did name John Lee to its “Young Gun” program, marking his race for extra support from the organization. Johnston said Democratic polling advantages reflect the lack of investment by national Republicans. “I thought Drew [Johnson] would be doing a little bit better, but he's just not,” Johnston said. “But it's somewhat reflective [of] Congressional Leadership Fund not, as of now, spending any money on either of these races.” Johnston said the poll shows that there is opportunity to flip Horsford’s district if Republican groups want to seize it — a chance for the GOP to flip the district for only the second time since the seat was created after the 2010 redistricting process. While Congressional District 3 is fairly suburban — a geographic area where Democrats have made gains in recent cycles — Congressional District 4 encompasses parts of rural central Nevada, where Trump has performed well when on the ballot. The poll found about 16 percent of voters remain undecided in Congressional District 4, with a margin of error of 6 percentage points. In Congressional District 3, the poll found Susie Lee with a 6.1 percentage point advantage over her opponentDrew Johnson, a tax analyst and conservative columnist. The margin of error for the district was 6 percentage points, and about 9 percent are undecided. Of the House members, Lee had the highest support — 48.5 percent. And in Congressional District 1, where Titus is in a rematch with her 2022 Republican opponent Mark Robertson, the poll found the incumbent leading by 5.7 percentage points — nearly identical to the margin by which she beat Robertson in 2022. The margin of error for the district was 7 percentage points, and nearly 17 percent are undecided. Finally, Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) has won every election in his Northern Nevada-based district by 15 points or more. But this cycle, rather than facing a Democratic challenger, he’s running against independent Greg Kidd, an entrepreneur who is self-funding his campaign and running an active ad campaign. The poll found Amodei up just 4.4 percentage points on Kidd — well within the 6 percentage point margin of error. But more than a third of the electorate remains undecided. Another third supported Amodei, with Kidd at 28.5 percent vote share. Republicans have controlled the district since it was created in 1983. Johnston cautioned that the poll was taken before this week’s Japanese stock marketcrashor Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV)endorsementof Kidd, both of which could affect the race. But even with a large percentage of voters undecided, he said the margin is a warning sign. “If I’m Amodei, I'm really worried right now,” he said. And while the poll reflects well on Democrats, Johnston cautioned against reading into the numbers too much. “I don't want to badmouth my own poll, but I don't think most polls should be taken that seriously until after Labor Day,” he said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/former-nv-gop-congressmen-elections-are-secure-but-chances-for-fraud-remain,True,"Two former Nevada Republican congressmen said Wednesday evening that they have faith in the sanctity of the state’s elections, but that recent changes could increase the public’s distrust in the election system. Reps. Joe Heck and Jon Porter joined former Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV) and Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat, on a panel that previewed how election integrity discussions may play out this year, with less than 90 days before Election Day. The roughly hourlong event at UNLV included discussions on political polarization, mail ballots, so-called “ballot harvesting” and foreign interference in elections. About two dozen people attended the event, with some appearing to doubt the security of Nevada’s electoral system. There is no evidence that widespread election fraud has occurred in Nevada or the rest of the country, despite myriad claims made by former President Donald Trump and other top Republicans. GOP officials have also tamped down their opposition to certain election procedures — particularly voting by mail, which has beenendorsedby Trump’s campaign this year — and most Republicans running in this year’s Nevada primaries havestayed awayfrom explicitly campaigning on election integrity. The panelists agreed that widespread fraud had not taken place in the 2020 presidential election, but Heck and Porter raised concerns about how recent changes to the state’s election system could upend public trust. “It does raise a lot of concern and suspicion for people for the sheer amount of opportunities for fraud,” Heck said during the panel. “I think one of the areas where people see a great opportunity for fraud is the widespread use of mail-in ballots.” Nevada lawmakers enactedseveral election rule changesin 2020 because of the pandemic, including sending mail ballots to all registered voters and allowing ballot harvesting, where people can drop off completed ballots of non-family members. In 2021, the Legislature permanentlyexpandeduniversal mail-in voting, while allowing voters to opt out of receiving mail ballots. In an interview after the event, Heck, who represented Congressional District 3 until he lost a 2016 bid for U.S. Senate, commended Aguilar and other state election officials in weeding out fraud in the state. He also said that as a former member of Congress, he sees his role as informing the public about how — even though new electoral processes could invite opportunities for fraud — there is no evidence of widespread irregularities. “Yes, there'll always be opportunity [for fraud],” Heck said. “But what it comes down to is how much actual fraud is really taking place. And I believe that in Nevada, steps are being taken to uphold the integrity of the election.” Meanwhile, Porter, who represented Congressional District 3 from 2003 to 2009, said he has concerns about ballot harvesting and rules on accepting ballots without a clear postmark. Porter, who is now a lobbyist, said that his views on election security are largely related to the national environment, rather than Nevada, which he said has done a good job of addressing election security. “I think Nevada has been so efficient and pragmatic in fixing any loophole, any problems,” Porter said. Other former Republican officials — including former Nevada Govs. Brian Sandoval and Robert List — have recentlyformed groupsseeking to restore public trust in elections. Last week, the Nevada Secretary of State’s Officereleasedits second quarterly report on election integrity investigations. The office has received 448 reports of violations so far this year, only two of which were found to be valid. There are 116 cases still open (26 percent), and 317 (70 percent) have been closed with no violation found. Since 2020, 20 cases have been referred for potential prosecution. Thefirst election fraud report, which was released in April, showed 14 prosecution referrals since 2020. At Wednesday’s panel, Aguilar defended how the state runs its elections and reiterated his push for more funding for local election offices, many of which also have other responsibilities on top of running their counties’ elections. “They don't have all the resources they need,” Aguilar said. “Elections have become so intense and so passionate they're spending the majority of their time on their elections, and still having to do their other jobs.” Aguilar also touted the upcoming release of a newtop-down voter registration system, which is set to be rolled out Aug. 17, and reminded voters it is their responsibility to maintain accurate registration information so that ballots are mailed to the correct address.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/is-nevada-still-a-swing-state-why-dems-gop-are-bullish-on-their-2024-chances,True,"When Vice President Kamala Harris took over from President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, the map of states that will decide the election remained the same — theoretically. Team Biden believed his best — and perhaps only — path to victory would be to win theblue wall statesof Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, plus Nebraska’s second congressional district. It was a narrow path to exactly 270 electoral votes. And while the Biden campaign had still put immense resources into its Nevada field operation, pollingpersistently showedTrump winning, to the point that the former president hadstoppedconsidering it as a swing state. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans have had Nevada circled and underlined for months. With Senate Democrats defending seven seats in red or purple states, Republicans have maintained that behind only Montana and Ohio, Sen. Jacky Rosen’s (D-NV) seat is their next best opportunity to flip. Harris’ ascendancy has key Democratic figures convinced that Nevada is now not only in play in the presidential race, but eminently winnable. But the new dynamic hasn’t dashed Republicans’ hopes. The conclusion? Between an interview with National Republican Senatorial Chair (NRSC) Steve Daines (R-MT) and new Democratic memos, it’s clear that both parties believe#WeMattermore than ever. Daines on NV Senate Daines took over the NRSC after a disastrous 2022 cycle for Senate Republicans in which they lost theoretically winnable races in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia (twice) and, by a margin of less than 1 percentage point, Nevada. As chairman, Daines and the NRSC got actively involved in primaries in order to avoid the “candidate quality” problem that plagued them in 2022, particularly in states such as Georgia and Pennsylvania where untested celebrities won primaries. In Nevada, they actively recruited and supported veteran Sam Brown, who challenged eventual GOP nominee Adam Laxalt, the state’s former attorney general, in 2022. In an interview last week with regional reporters, Daines was bullish on Brown’s prospects due to three factors — rising Republican voter registration, expected presidential year turnout and existing polling dynamics. “Sam Brown’s going to have a good chance to win that seat,” Daines said. When Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) beat Laxalt, Democratshada 9 percent voter registration lead among active voters in Clark County. Today, that figure hasfallento 7.4 percent. In a state where the final statewide margins can be incredibly slim, Daines believes that change is meaningful. “Laxalt lost by 8,000 votes,” Daines said. “It was the tightest Senate race in the cycle. That's four votes per precinct. That's not lost [on us] — and certainly on both sides of the ledger.” Secondly, Daines believes that while Democrats squeezed nearly every vote they could out of the blue-trending suburbs in 2022, there are more GOP votes to be found this fall in the rural counties. Daines said that most rural counties had turnout rates near 50 percent in 2022, but he expects around 70 percent turnout in 2024 — which might translate into a few hundred votes per county, but in the aggregate, could overpower Democratic advantages in urban areas. Lyon County, for example, had 54 percent turnout in the 2022 midterm but 75 percent in 2020. Elko County had 57 percent turnout in the midterm but 86 percent in 2020. “Had Laxalt run in a presidential year, Laxalt would have won that race in Nevada,” Daines said. Of course, Democrats believe they have turnout boosters of their own, particularly for the critical bloc of nonpartisan voters, who outnumber registered voters of either party. A constitutional amendment to codify the right to an abortion in the statequalifiedfor the 2024 ballot — a tactic that has amixed recordin turning Democrats out. The main dynamic souring Senate Republican dreams this cycle has been a stubborn polling split in the presidential and Senate races. Despite Trumpleadingby an average of 4 points in RealClearPolitics’ polling average, BrowntrailsRosen by an average of 4 points. Rosen has led in polls all cycle, with margins ranging from 2 percentage points to 12 percentage points. But Daines — like manypolitical scientists— believes that level of ticket splitting is highly unlikely once ballots are actually cast, and recent history shows that in swing states especially, the margins of the presidential and Senate races should be similar. In 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton won Nevada by a 2.42 percent margin; Cortez Masto (D-NV) won by 2.43 percentage points. “History shows in a presidential year these races will all start to track by the time they get to the end of October,” Daines said, noting that the same party won the presidential and the Senate race in 68 of 69 statewide races during the last two presidential election cycles. “And then on Election Day, importantly, we'll be tracking pretty close with the presidential ballot.” Still, Nevada has some semi-recent history of ticket splitting — in 2012, the state was the only one in the nation to elect a Republican senator (Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) while going for Barack Obama in the presidential race. Even though Brown trails in polls, Daines believes there are positive signs for Republicans. AYouGov pollfrom early July, before Biden dropped out, found Rosen with 47 percent of the vote, a full 7 points above Brown but a lower mark than fellow incumbent senators, suggesting to Daines that there is room for Brown to grow among undecided voters. In that same survey, Sens. Bob Casey (D-PA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) stood at 50 percent of the ballot share. “That's a big warning sign for an incumbent,” Daines said. “It also shows there's great upside for Sam Brown at the moment there — that's a name ID gap.” That dynamic isn’t universally true across public polling. An Emerson College poll from Junedid showRosen at 50 percent — the highest among Democratic Senate candidates in swing states. And Rosen is better positioned to win the name identification battle due to her vast war chest — to date, she’s outspent Brown on the airwaves by nearly $5 million despite not facing a competitive primary, and Democrats have a $30 million advantage in future television advertising reservations. Presidential dynamics On the other side, Nevada Democrats believe Harris’ candidacy has rejuvenated their expectations for Nevada — where no federal candidate has lost statewide since 2012. Democratic political consultant Rebecca Lambe — the late Sen. Harry Reid’s (D-NV) longtime right hand — in amemoreleased Monday laid out the case for a “Western Wall” of Nevada and Arizona that can provide Harris with multiple paths to victory. Lambe noted that pollster Nate Silver’selectoral modelingindicated that Harris has moved the needle for Democrats more in the Sunbelt than any other region. While Harris replacing Biden swung the polling average most significantly in Michigan, moving the needle 4.4 points in Democrats’ direction, Arizona and Nevada were second and third on that list. In Nevada, Harris’ candidacy moved polls 2.8 percentage points toward Democrats (though post-Biden dropout polling has been scarce in Nevada). Implicit in the Harris-focused analysis is that the previous Biden-led ticket was faltering in Nevada. But in arguing for a Western Wall path to victory, Democrats believe prior results were tied more to Biden’s unpopularity rather than being symptomatic of deeper issues in the state for the party. In the memo, Lambe argues that Harris’ strengths with key constituencies dovetails with Nevada’s electorate — making the state worthy of investment on the quest for 270 electoral votes. “Nevada is younger and more diverse than any other battleground, which is why it is experiencing a significant swing toward Harris,” she wrote.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/hospitality-workers-union-endorses-harris-dismissing-trumps-pledge-of-tax-free-tips,True,"By Josh Boak, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — The hospitality workers' union UNITE HERE has endorsedVice President Kamala Harrisfor president, a rejoinder to Republican Donald Trump's effort to woo restaurant and hotel workers by promising to make their tips tax-free. Gwen Mills, the union's president, said Trump was merely ""making a play"" for votes while Harris has credibility from having supported unions. She discussed the move with The Associated Press before the union's announcement of an endorsement. The endorsement includes a commitment by the union to have its members knock on more than 3.3 million doors for Harris in swing states that include Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina. Trump, the former president, proposed excluding tips from federal income taxes during a June 9 rally in Nevada. Both of Nevada's Democratic senators, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto, have supported Trump's idea, a sign of its potential popularity. ""To those hotel workers and people who get tips, you are going to be very happy, because when I get to office we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips,"" Trump said at the event. The Biden administration has countered that tipped workers would be better off with a higher minimum wage. President Joe Biden stepped down from the ballot roughly two weeks ago and Harris, whose portfolio as vice president includes organized labor, has embraced many of his existing economic proposals. In speeches, she also has pushed for rules to make it easier for workers to unionize. After replacing Biden, Harris has swiftly consolidated what can be a fractious Democratic coalition, including lining up support from labor unions. The AFL-CIO, which counts UNITE HERE as a member, has endorsed Harris after having backed Biden. The United Auto Workers on Wednesday formally backed the vice president. The Harris campaign and its allieshave previously indicated that the election's outcome will hinge on which side generates superior turnout, which is where UNITE HERE believes it can help Democrats. Rashad Eaton, 43, first canvassed for Democrat John Fetterman's successful campaign for a Pennsylvania Senate seat in the 2022 elections. A resident of Philadelphia and UNITE HERE member, Eaton works for the food vendor Aramark at basketball, hockey and football games. He said he hears from voters on a range of issues, like gun violence and corporate greed, but he'll be canvassing for Harris because ""Trump is trying to destroy everything.""",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-how-would-question-1-on-nevadas-2024-ballot-affect-the-board-of-regents,True,"It’s deja vu all over againwhen it comes to Question 1 on the 2024 ballot, as voters once more have a chance to remove the constitutional status of the elected Board of Regents who oversee higher education in the state. Voters rejected a similar effort on the 2020 ballot, but what’s different this time (if anything) and what would Question 1 actually do if passed? Summary of what it does:Question 1 would remove all references to the Board of Regents fromthe Nevada Constitution, nullifying its constitutionally established status. Instead, it wouldauthorizethe Legislature to “review, reform and improve the programs and operations” of public universities and require biennial audits of public higher education institutions. The amendment also removes references to the board as it relates to the proceeds of public lands donated to support public institutions of higher education. Though the proposed amendment would remove the constitutional language, it would not repeal or affect other existing laws applying to the Board of Regents, such as the board’s authority to govern and manage the Nevada System of Higher Education or the processes for electing board members. How did we get here?:Nearly four years ago, a similar ballot measure (which also appeared as Question 1) removing the Board of Regents from the Nevada Constitution narrowly failed by about 3,800 votes, or 0.3 percentage points out of the 1.2 million votes cast. Read More: How a multi-year push to remove the Board of Regents from the state Constitution failed at the ballot box In the 2021 legislative session, lawmakers restarted the process of getting another question on the ballot through the introduction ofSJR7— a legislatively referred constitutional amendment, meaning it needs to be passed in two consecutive legislative sessions and then approved by voters before taking effect. Supporters of the measure chalked up its earlier failure to confusing language — the version on the 2024 ballot no longer contains language enshrining protections for academic freedom, and includes a new requirement for biennial audits of the higher education system. SJR7 easily passed in the 2021 and 2023 legislative sessions, securing its place on the 2024 ballot. What have other states done?Nevada is among28 stateswith a single administrative board overseeing all higher education institutions within its borders. Nevada is the only one among those states that elects all members of its higher education oversight board through a general election. Most other state boards are filled by appointments by governors or legislatures, or sometimes a combination of the two. The arguments in favor:Supporters of Question 1 — a broad coalition of legislators, business interests and some higher education students and faculty — say the measure will help provide more oversight for the Board of Regents. The text of SJR7 cites legal casesfrom 1948 and 1981and incidents in which “the Board of Regents has asserted that its ‘unique constitutional status’ gives it ‘virtual autonomy and thus immunity’ from particular laws and policies enacted by the Legislature.” Sponsor Sen. Marilyn Dondero Loop (D-Las Vegas) said in 2023 that it would allow lawmakers to exercise “informed and measured governance of NSHE” and have more flexibility when considering reform proposals. Dondero Loop emphasized that the measure wouldn’t remove the public election of regents, and the measure is only focused on “taking [the Board of Regents] out of the Constitution.” Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas), who presented the bill with Dondero Loop, said last year that the board has “virtually unparalleled power within state government to control and manage higher education spending without the same level of legislative oversight typically applied to other executive branch agencies.” Kasama said the amendment's changes, including a biennial legislative audit, will bring an “enhanced level of transparency” and trust to the state’s higher education system. The measure passed with bipartisan support in the 2021 and 2023 legislative sessions. SJR7 cruised relatively easily through the 2021 legislative session, passing 20-0 (1 excused) in the Senate and 30-11 in the Assembly, with most opposition concentrated in the minority Assembly Republican caucus. In 2023, members of the Assembly voted 34-7 to pass it, with one lawmaker excused, and members of the Senate voted 20-1 to pass the measure. The Nevada Faculty Alliance endorsed the ballot measure in September,writingthat, if approved by voters, the union is “confident the Board of Regents will continue to govern the Nevada System of Higher Education but with great oversight by the legislature, especially over fiscal management.” Previously, the union was neutral on the ballot measure. The arguments against:Members of NSHE and the Board of Regents have staunchly opposed both attempts to take the board out of the Constitution. Many have complained that proponents have not adequately explained how it would address problems within the state’s higher education system in a way normal legislation would not, and have said lawmakers are infringing on the will of the voters who already voted down the measure once. Inhearing testimonyduring the 2023 legislative session, board Vice Chair Joe Arrascada likened the push to resurrect the failed Question 1 to 2020-style election denialism. “This new resolution is blatantly questioning the voters' will,” Arrascada said. “To many of your constituents, this do-over is similar to an election denier of the same 2020 cycle.” Primary funders:Data from political ad-tracking organization AdImpact indicates that almost no money has been spent on advertising for the ballot measure. When a similar ballot measure went before voters in 2020, nearly $1 million was raised in its favor, and no group mounted a coordinated opposition effort. Financial impact:No fiscal notes — a description of the anticipated financial effect on state agencies — were submitted in either the 2021 or 2023 legislative sessions for SJR7. However, theinitial fiscal noteon a bill (AB416) in 2021 setting up a three-year audit of NSHE was $699,000, not including regular Legislative Counsel Bureau or NSHE staff time. State lawmakers later amended AB416 to a partial audit of nonstate self-supporting accounts to reduce the cost. Intern Kelsea Frobes contributed reporting to this story.

Carson City District Court Judge Kristin Luis on Friday heard arguments from attorneys representing the minor political party and the Nevada Democratic Party — which filed the lawsuit — but opted not to issue a ruling from the bench. “Time is of the essence,” Luis acknowledged. “I would have to imagine that whichever way I decide somebody's going to appeal.” The Green Party, which has not been on a Nevada general election ballot since 2008, had appeared toqualifyfor the state’sballot in mid-June with about 15,000 valid signatures, well more than the requirement of roughly 10,000 valid signatures.

But Nevada Democrats quicklyfiled a lawsuitseeking to block the party’s efforts to land on the ballot, saying they had reviewed a limited number of signatures via a public records request and found most of the signatures were invalid. The lawsuit claimed that some of the gathered signatures had been obtained before its petition to get on the ballot was approved and should be considered invalid. The possibility of the Green Party’s inclusion as a qualified third party candidate on the 2024 ballot could potentially aid Republican former President Donald Trump by pulling dissatisfied left-leaning voters away from the Democratic Party in what is expected to be Nevada’s close presidential race. During the Friday hearing, Todd Bice, who represents the Nevada Democratic Party, argued that the minor party’s petition contained the wrong affidavit language, saying that the county clerks who validated the signatures were unaware of this until after they had validated the signatures. Bice said the Green Party’s petition appeared to use the affidavit language for initiative petitions, not minor parties, which omits a sentence stating the circulator believes all signees were registered voters in the county they reside. However, the affidavit language used by the party is the same as that recommended by the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office in itsguidefor minor political parties to qualify for the ballot. Greg Ott, an attorney with the attorney general’s office speaking on behalf of the secretary of state’s office, said during the hearing that the guide is not legal advice, and there are reminders within it to consult state law for the most accurate information. Kevin Benson, an attorney representing the Green Party, rebutted Bice and said that the missing statement is already accounted for in the verification process. He added that the secretary of state declared it to be qualified, and the plaintiffs did not produce evidence that enough signatures were invalid to not qualify for the ballot. “The Green Party made a good faith effort to comply with the law,” Benson said, adding that “circulating a petition is a human endeavor,” acknowledging that there will be mistakes, but that’s not any indication that anything nefarious took place. In response, Bice said the mistakes were not human error, but “shenanigans” and signature-gatherers were not following the law. “You cannot claim you substantially comply with law, because somehow you can just assume the signatures are valid,” he said. In 2016, a federal judgedenied ballot accessto the party after it had not gathered enough valid signatures in time. Minor parties must submit candidates for president and vice-president to the secretary of state’s office by the last Tuesday in August. The party has not yet submitted a candidate for the November ballot, but its former presidential candidate, Jill Stein, is running again this year. Stein, who is polling about1 percentin Nevada, called the lawsuit “outrageous” in avideoposted to her campaign website.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-denies-trump-gop-request-to-ignore-nevada-mail-ballots-with-unclear-postmark,True,"A Carson City judge denied a motion by former President Donald Trump’s campaign and state Republicans to stop counting mail ballots that lack a clear postmark and are received three days after Election Day. Carson City District Court Judge James Russell denied the request for a preliminary injunction Friday, a spokesperson for the Nevada Attorney General’s Office confirmed toThe Nevada Independent. The decision marks the third legal defeat for the Republican National Committee (RNC), Nevada Republican Party and Trump campaign in their efforts to challenge Nevada election laws before the 2024 election. The attorney general’s office did not offer any other details about the ruling. Thesuit, which challenges election procedures in Nevada, has not yet been dismissed. It hinges onApril testimonyfrom Mark Wlaschin, the deputy secretary of state for elections, who said during a public meeting that the office accepts and counts ballots received in the mail as many as three days after Election Day, even if it does not have a clear postmark. The Nevada GOP and the RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the decision or whether they plan to appeal. Wlaschin’s testimony and the lawsuit, however, did not indicate that this is an active practice in elections. State law requires election officials to count all mail ballots postmarked by Election Day up to four business days afterwards. The law alsoallowsofficials to count mail ballots postmarked with a date that “cannot be determined” and received within the three days following Election Day. The suit alleged that the state is too broadly interpreting the law by also counting received mail ballots that are not postmarked at all. A Maymemothe secretary of state’s office sent to local election officials notes that mail ballots received with “no visible postmark should be interpreted to have an indeterminate postmark,” and that those ballots can be counted as valid if received within three days of Election Day. The memo notes that it will seek to codify the guidance as a state regulation after the election cycle. Other lawsuits from the Trump campaign and RNC filed in Nevada were dismissed earlier this year, including anattemptto block the Nevada law that allows ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted up to four days afterwards, anda separate federal lawsuitalleging errors in the state’s voter roll maintenance.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-aligned-super-pac-boosts-brown-on-nevada-airwaves-with-4-million-ad-buy,True,"A super PAC affiliated with the fiscally conservative Club for Growth is dropping $4 million on a new ad campaign to boost Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown in Nevada. Win It Back PAC began airing its first Nevada ad Friday as part of an ad buy that will run through the month of August. The ad, titled “Six Years,” opens with a clip of a Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) ad in which she says she has put Nevada’s interest over her party’s, before pivoting to attack Rosen on how often she votes with President Joe Biden’s position and on rising costs. Club for Growth’s ad comes at a pivotal moment in the Senate advertising battle in Nevada, where Democrats have so far outspent Republicans by nearly $40 million in past and future advertising. Outside of the new ad buy, Republican-aligned groups only have $66,000 worth of ads airing in the Senate race this week, according to data from ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Democratic groups, led by the advertising arm of Democratic leadership-aligned Senate Majority PAC, have spent $2.1 million. Republican-aligned outside groups and Brown’s campaign (excluding Club for Growth) have made about $13.5 million in future ad reservations for the Nevada Senate race, compared to $47.3 million for Democratic-aliged groups and Rosen’s campaign. The ad attacks Rosen as having voted with Biden “99 percent of the time,” citing aFox Newsarticleanalyzing Rosen’s 2023 votes. That number fluctuates depending on the year and the vote. From 2021 to 2022, when Democrats had full control of Congress, Rosenvotedwith Biden’s position 93 percent of the time. In 2023, while she did vote with Biden nearly 99 percent of the time, she again stood at 93 percent whennomination voteswere not counted. The ad then details how the rising price of gas and eggs across the U.S. and housing in Nevada since January 2021 when Biden took office. And it accuses Rosen of sending stimulus checks to “illegal aliens” — a reference to the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which sent $1,400 checks to qualifying people with Social Security numbers. Most undocumented immigrants were therefore ineligible, though people whooverstayedtheir visas would have been eligible. “They got your money, we got higher prices, and Jacky Rosen should get a pink slip,” theadconcludes.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/harris-is-planning-a-tour-of-battleground-states-next-week-with-her-yet-to-be-named-running-mate,True,"By Bill Barrow, Steve Peoples and Zeke Miller, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris is set to launch a battleground tour next week with her yet-to-be-named running mate, with stops in seven swing states stretching from Pennsylvania to Nevada, her campaign said Tuesday. The planned tour is the latest sign of the whirlwind pace at which Harris has gone from President Joe Biden's supportive running mate to likely Democratic nominee ready to identify her No. 2 and take on Republican Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Harris said Tuesday she hadn't made a decision yet on whom she will select. Those who are under consideration have been demonstrating a time-honored tradition: summertime auditions in which vice presidential contenders walk the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss. READ MORE: Can Harris energize minority Nevada voters who had soured on Trump, Biden? To that end, Democrat Josh Shapiro told enthusiastic voters in suburban Philadelphia this week that Harris belongs in the White House — and then reminded them of all he's done as governor of battleground Pennsylvania. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, likewise, told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of ""a great president"" — and then highlighted the elections he's won as a Democrat in Republican territory. Harris' campaign has been vetting about a dozen potential running mates, according to people familiar with the search process. Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are seen as among the front-runners, according to the people. The campaign said Harris and her running mate will make stops next week in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas. In the meantime, Harris advisers, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, have been combing through reams of paperwork submitted by potential running mates, while the candidate herself is holding personal conversations with the finalists, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public. Harris, according to another person familiar with the matter, is seeking someone with executive experience who can also serve as a governing partner. Notions of a so-called short list have not stopped those on the Democrats' broader national bench from finding the spotlight. ""I'm not going to talk about the interactions I've had with the campaign,"" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declared recently on MSNBC. He added, though, ""Let's just say I'm aware that the vetting process is quite an in depth one."" Then he listed his accomplishments, offering that he was the only Midwestern governor to raise his state minimum wage to $15 per hour. Harris would be the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as president. Many Democrats have argued she should balance her ticket both demographically and politically. Shapiro, 51, is among the most popular U.S. governors, winning his 2022 election in a rout over a Trump-endorsed Republican. He's an outspoken supporter of abortion rights who has won three statewide elections in Pennsylvania. His speaking style draws comparisons to former President Barack Obama. But he has taken flak from the left for his support for Israel's war on Hamas, a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure.His allies argue that he would help Harris win Pennsylvania, complicating if not blocking Trump's path to an Electoral College majority. Like all contenders, Shapiro sidesteps questions about the vetting process and stresses Harris should not be pressured. But he's mentioned more than once that he's known her for nearly two decades. Beshear stands out in a heavily Republican state. During his weekend stop in Georgia, he talked of winning votes in ""tough counties"" but emphasized liberal bona fides: ""I am a proud pro-union governor. I am a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor."" Closest in age to JD Vance among the Democrats' possibilities, Beshear openly mocks Trump's understudy for presenting himself as a son of Appalachia. ""I mean, there's a county that JD Vance says he's from in Kentucky – and I won it by 22 points last November,"" he said. READ MORE: In first Nevada trip, Vance says Harris ‘owns every failure’ of Biden admin Beshear and Shapiro were both state attorneys general, like Harris, before becoming governors. But their tenures did not overlap considerably with Harris' service in California. She worked more closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper during his days as an attorney general, but Cooper on Monday said he had opted not to be considered for vice president. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, 60, is a favorite of some progressives. He brings an atypical national political resume: He was a non-commissioned Army officer, public school teacher and state high school championship football coach before entering politics. Before being elected governor, he was one of the last white Democrats in Congress to represent a mostly rural, small-town House district — a notable juxtaposition to Harris, the Bay Area Californian. ""She will make the best choice she's going to,"" Walz said Sunday on CNN, a day after Trump held a mass rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota. ""One way or another, she is going to win in November, and that's going to benefit everyone,"" Walz said, including ""a lot of those folks who were out in St. Cloud with the (former) president."" Kelly, 60, is the only top contender in Congress. He boasts an impressive military resume and experience as an astronaut. He has strong Latino support locally and solid relationships with Arizona officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. That balance could give him credibility on immigration policy as Republicans frame high numbers of migrant border crossings as a national crisis. But Kelly has had to shore up his credentials with labor, a key Democratic faction. He took heat from union leaders because he was one of just a handful of Democrats who did not sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would make it easier to organize workers. He said at the time he supported the goals but had concerns. Following pressure this month, he now says he would vote for the bill if it came up for a vote. While Harris considers her choices, everyone seems to have an opinion. Steven Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, laughed as he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday that his office has received thousands of recommendations from around the country. Donna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and was instrumental in urging Biden to pick Harris in 2020, said the selection process involves ""a lot of noise"" that underplays the complexity of the decision. READ MORE: Harris' longstanding ties to Nevada could benefit her 2024 run ""The most important stage is what the lawyers will do to you,"" she said, with a laugh and emphasizing the seriousness. ""It's worse than a dental hygiene check. … Before you get to suitability and other factors, before it gets to political people like me, they've done a forensic examination of your life.""

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/can-harris-energize-minority-nevada-voters-who-had-soured-on-trump-biden,True,"Lesile Swest says they started to support the Democrats after President Joe Bidendropped out of the raceand Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive nominee. At a campaign event in North Las Vegas this weekend, the 32-year-old Las Vegas resident wore a shirt that read “I used to be a victim until I voted. “We're looking for progressiveness,” Swest, who is Black, said. “We weren't getting progressiveness from Biden or Trump.” It’s dissatisfied voters such as Swest who the nascent Harris campaign is banking on mobilizing after the top-of-the-ticket shuffle, especially amid former President Donald Trump’spersistent polling advantageover Biden in Nevada (including better numbers with minority voters) throughout the 2024 campaign. In Nevada, nearlya fifth of registered voters identify as Latinoand thestate has the third highest growing Black population in the nation— making outreach to minority voting blocs a critical part of any campaign strategy in the battleground state. Already, Harris has more nationwide favorability with Latino andBlackvoters than Biden did, early polling data indicates. To that end, the Harris campaign held more than 50 events in Nevada last weekend, many aimed at attracting Black and LGBTQ+ voters. The campaign says the efforts reached nearly 50,000 voters and ​​were supported by more than 1,000 volunteers, surpassing any of the Biden campaign’s previous campaign efforts. Almost all of the attendees thatThe Nevada Independentspoke to at a canvassing event in North Las Vegas said that Harris’ vitality and entry into the race had inspired them to get out and canvass for the first time. Black voters Dina Piersawl, 61-year-old chemist who just moved from Chicago, praised Harris’ depth of political experience and said she can “run circles” around other candidates. For Piersawl and other voters and volunteers at a packed Black voters for Harris event in North Vegas on Saturday, there was a clear contrast between Harris, of an Indian and Jamaican background, and Trump, who she called an “obvious racist.” Harris’ favorability among Black voters already surpasses Biden’s by 7 points, according to a mid-July poll from the left-leaning pollsterData for Progress.The same poll foundonly 49 percentof Black voters nationwide believed Biden should have remained in the presidential race. Trump has publicly attempted to court Black voters — exit polls indicated that18 percentof Black voters in Nevada supported him in 2020, a 6 percentage point increase from2016anddoublethe support that GOP candidate Mitt Romney received from Black voters in 2012. As a professional Black woman, Piersawl said she relates to Harris and thinks the previous attacks on her performance as vice president and a U.S senator were unwarranted, calling them a result of racism and misogyny. “I understand the plight of being a Black professional woman,” Piersawl said. “You have to be twice as good.” Trump and those in his political orbithave not shied awayfrom attacking Harris based on her race and gender — a line of attack that Swest (who recently attended a Trump rally) said she was shocked to hear and contrasted poorly to Harris. “Harris represents the products of slavery in America in the best way,” Swest said. “She has our best intentions at heart.” Dylen Richmond, a 20-year-old Las Vegas resident and a student at Morehouse College, a historically Black college in Georgia, said he’s become increasingly hopeful about the Democrats’ chances in November as he’s seen more of his friends post online in support of Harris. The journalism and economics double major became a campaign volunteer the same day Biden announced the end of his re-election bid. “We got this thing in the bag, honestly,” a confident Richmond predicted. Polling has been scant in Nevada since Biden dropped out of the race, but Harris led Trump by 2 points in a recentBloomberg/Morning Consult poll. Another national poll releasedThursdaybyAxiosfound that Harris significantly leads Trump among 18-to-34-year-old voters. Yet, for Richmond, the threat of another Trump presidency andProject 2025— a conservative policy playbook assembled by the Heritage Foundation for the next Republican presidential administration — is more important than who is the Democratic candidate. “I’ve got some friends saying, ‘Hey, we have to fight against that.’ It's not just about her. It's about her supporting us.” he said. The surprise appearance of Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) at the North Las Vegas event on Saturday helped further rally support for Harris. The voters, Booker said, were “the foot soldiers for justice.” Latino voters Latino support for Harris, however, is a bit less clear-cut. Over a third of Nevada Latinosvoted for Trump in 2020, signaling that Republicansupport among the demographic group seems to be growing. While Democrats have hoped that they could continue to rally Latino support with a more liberal immigration platform,multiple surveyssignal that Latinos are warming to more stringent immigration measures and increasingly trust the GOP to handle the issue. Historically, Republicans have gained about a third of the Latino vote nationwide, said Clarissa Martinez De Castro, vice president of UnidosUS's Latino Vote Initiative. Support for Democrat’s among Latinos has slightly waned and right now, the GOP is on track to regain that percentage and maybe even improve slightly upon it, Martinez De Castro predicted. Last month, a survey fromTelevisaUnivisionshowed 33 percent of registered Latino voters in Nevada “definitely” supported Biden, with 30 percent definitely supporting Trump, well within the statistical margin of error. Harris, however, appears to be on track to winning back Nevada Latinos who had slipped away from Biden, according toan early readof a July poll from the Democratic firm Equis Research. Harris “notably pulls a chunk who said they would sit out a Biden/Trump rematch,” said Carlos Odio, the company’s co-founder, on X. “Republicans are regaining some ground, and they could potentially improve upon that,” Martinez De Castro said. “But they're not getting a majority, which is what some of the stories seem to imply.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-first-nevada-trip-vance-says-harris-owns-every-failure-of-biden-admin,True,"Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) made his first visit to Nevada on Tuesday since becoming the Republican nominee for vice president, attacking Vice President Kamala Harris’ immigration record and arguing the new Democratic frontrunner was responsible for rising costs. Vance’s two-city swing started off with a speech in Henderson and included a speech in Reno later in the day. Speaking to a crowd of hundreds at Liberty High School in Henderson, he accused Harris of being culpable for record-setting border crossings, a “cover-up” of President Joe Biden’s health and an economy that has suffered from high inflation (which has since eased). He also said electing his running mate — former President Donald Trump — is the only way America will regain its strength domestically and internationally. With a focus on Harris’ role in immigration policy and her record as a Democratic senator (shewas once ratedthe most liberal member of the Senate), Vance’s 25-minute speech offered a preview into how Republicans plan to reshift their campaign tactics after Biden stepped aside and Democrats coalesced around Harris. “Kamala Harris owns every failure of the Biden administration over the last four years,” Vance said. In Reno, Vance reiterated much of his earlier message to more than a thousand people who assembled at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center: “If we don't stop Kamala Harris, we are going to lose the American dream.” He emphasized that the United States needs a president who will tell energy workers to “drill baby, drill,” welcome fracking and “launch the largest deportation program in American history.” Since Trump tapped Vance as his running mate two weeks ago,polls have shownthe first-term senator to have historically low approval ratings for a running mate at this point in the election cycle. Vance, who rose to fame after the publication of his 2016 memoirHillbilly Elegy, has been hammered by Democrats about his resurfaced past remarks, includingreferringto Harris as a “childless cat lady [who] wants to make the rest of the country miserable too,” and 2022 comments supportinga national abortion ban. His appearance in Nevada comes as experts anticipate a close election in Nevada, after Trump routinely led Biden in polls of the Silver State throughout the year. National surveys show Harris making gains among younger voters and minority groups, and aBloomberg/Morning Consultpollreleased Tuesday afternoon showed HarrisleadingTrump by 2 percent in Nevada. Nevada has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 2008, but the margin of victory in the state has continued to shrink. Though the state has a Democratically dominated state Legislature and congressional delegation, Gov. Joe Lombardo and a handful of other Republicans won statewide races in 2022, growing Republican hopes of flipping the state in 2024. Vance was briefly joined by Sam Brown, the Republican candidate seeking to unseat Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV). Brown said that Vance and Trump show “what leadership looks like.” Vance’s speech Like he has at other campaign stops, Vance pummeled Harris for the Biden administration’s immigration policies. He referred to Harris as the administration’s “border czar,” atitlethatemerged regarding confusionon her role after being tasked by Biden to investigate the root causes of a surge of migrant crossings at the border, and highlightedcommentsshe made in 2019 supporting decriminalizing illegal immigration. “As America's border czar, Kamala Harris unleashed the worst border crisis in American history,” Vance said. Data shows asignificant dropin recent border crossings, with June marking the fewest monthly illegal crossings since Biden took office in January 2021. Illegal border crossingssoared to record-breaking highsfrom 2021 to 2023, but have since decreased after asweeping executive orderfrom Biden that allows border officials to remove migrants without processing their asylum requests once a certain threshold is met. “If you are in this country illegally, start packing your bags right now, because Donald Trump is coming back,” Vance said in his Reno speech. Vance also hit Harris on the economy, saying she supports closing American factories and is responsible for the country’s “affordability crisis.” “Higher groceries, higher energy prices, higher housing prices — it is destroying the American dream, and it is Kamala Harris' fault,” Vance said. He accused Harris of wanting to roll back gun rights (The New York Timesalsoreportedthis week that she supports an assault weapons ban but has walked back forcing owners to sell them to the federal government) and said Trump is the only candidate who supports police officers. Vance also leaned into his personal story and talked about being raised by his grandmother after his mother struggled with addiction and dad left when he was young. “That was the woman who gave me all the opportunities that I've had, and I'm so grateful for all the strong women out there, especially the strong grandmas and the strong moms,” he said. He also accused Harris and the media of covering up Biden’s fitness to be president. He called the push by top Democrats to force Biden, 81, off the ticket as a “coup” and suggested that Harris had been leading the country the past four years. “He didn't know what was going on, so somebody was calling the shots, and we know it was Kamala Harris,” Vance said. “Do you want a president who is disloyal to this country or do you want one who was willing to take a bullet for it?” What do voters think about Vance? While most votersThe Nevada Independentspoke to at the Henderson event said that they hadn’t previously heard of Vance, they’ve come to support him as someone who espouses working class and family values. More than any specific policies, attendees pointed out his blue-collar upbringing in Appalachia as what made him a good pick for vice president. Jason D’Souza, a 47-year-old who moved to Las Vegas from California after he had lost custody of his infant son, feels that Vance, who grew up with an absent father, will understand his struggle and those of other estranged parents. “That’s all I want is to be a dad. Then I see J.D. Vance and the same thing happened with his dad. He couldn’t be in his dad’s life. They said ‘oh child support,’” D’Souza said. D’Souza blames California Democrats such as Harris for waning “parental rights.” That, on top of the rising cost of living in California, pushed him to move to Vegas. Similar to D’Souza, Caylin Tyrell, 29, recently moved from her home state of Hawaii to Nevada last year because of rising costs. Tyrell had previously supported Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, but she says she increasingly found Clinton’s and Democrats’ political messaging hollow as she grew older. The media, Tyrell and her mother said, have unfairly censored Trump through sound bites and outsized focus on his former celebrity status. Recent criticism of Vance’s comments on women were likely just another attempt by the corporate media to sow distrust they contend. “People take clips of Trump and chop it up and make him seem like a bad person,” Tyrell said. For many attendees, economic woes were also entangled with concerns about border control. Stan, a 45-year-old who declined to give his last name, splits his time between Nevada and Arizona, where immigration is a hot button topic. He said that although immigration is a “wonderful thing,” it has further strained resources and raised prices. “I’m really for the America first agenda right now,” he said. “Not until we know what we’re doing here should we open up.” All the attendees thatThe Nevada Independentspoke to said they held favorable views of Vance. Harris' rising popularity won’t last long, many predicted. Reporter Tabitha Mueller contributed to this story.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/new-pacs-who-spent-big-on-nevada-primaries-finally-disclose-sources-of-income,True,"The primary standoff between Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) and longtime city officials was even more expensive than previously thought. North Las Vegas Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown and City Council members Isaac Barron and Scott Black all have ties to a new PAC behind the mailers that described Neal as “‘Dirty Deal’ Neal” and alleged that she has been “soft-on-crime for decades [and] has tried to destroy our police department and community.” The trio of officials — whofeudedwithNeal in the 2023 Legislature and publicly backed her state Senate primary opponent — collectively donated $16,000 that eventually went to thePAC. But the extent of those ties only became public last week with the release of campaign finance reports for the second quarter, which runs from April through June — more than one month after Neal cruised to re-election in early June. So why are we just learning about this now? A loophole in Nevada law allows PACs (and political candidates) to wait more than a month after the state’s primaries to disclose information about who's funding them and how much money they spent in the second quarter. A subset of PACs that register after March 31 can take particular advantage of this loophole because they are not required to report any campaign finance information until after the primary, leaving the public even more in the dark about their operations. ANevada Independentanalysis found that26 new PACs and political nonprofitswere registered between April 1 and the June 11 primary. Together, 10 of these groups raked in more than $1.6 million in that period and spent almost all of that money — transactions that only became public this month. Read More: Who’s funding negative campaign mail? Legal loophole helps some groups avoid disclosure The loophole stems from a 2017 law (AB45) that, in part, shifted state campaign finance reporting deadlines to a quarterly system, in line with the schedule followed by candidates for federal office, but without any of theadditional transparency requirementsfor reporting pre-election fundraising totals. The change was made viaan amendmentoffered by Sen. Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas), though the concept was never discussed during a billhearing. “It's an effective means to be quiet with your money,” said Ken Miller, a UNLV political science professor. “You can set up this PAC at the last minute, you can engage in whatever sort of advertising or advocacy you want to do, and then you can fold up, and no one's going to notice until after the election’s over.” The topline fundraising haul was almost entirely made up by the $1.4 million that was raised and spent by the Better Nevada Ballot Advocacy Committee, a new PAC that is an offshoot of the Gov. Joe Lombardo-affiliated Better Nevada PAC. This committee helped gather signatures for the ballot question to require voter ID, whichhas qualifiedfor the November ballot. The entirety of the $1.4 million fundraising haulcame in a roundabout wayfrom the Las Vegas Sands, which contributed $1.5 million to the Better Nevada PAC, which turned around and contributed a similar amount to the offshoot PAC. All of this money was spent on advertising and consultants. Otherwise, the most notable disclosures came from PACs involved in the North Las Vegas state Senate Democratic primary. The group behind the anti-Neal mailers — called North Valley — received donations from two other committees: the Moving Forward PAC ($13,000) and North Las Vegas Momentum PAC ($3,000). The Moving Forward PAC formed in April and isregisteredto Goynes-Brown under the email[email protected]. Within 10 days of being registered, the PACraised$14,000, with $7,000 each from Goynes-Brown and Black. All but $1,000 went to the North Valley PAC, with the rest unspent. The North Las Vegas Momentum PAC is registered to Black and has been active since 2022. Itraised$26,000 in the second quarter — with donations from Stations Casino, the city’s police supervisors PAC and supporters of North Las Vegas Councilman Richard Cherchio — and gave $3,000 to North Valley. The remainder of North Valley’s second quarter haul was a $350 contribution from Barron, who was listed as the PAC’s chair and wasappointedthis month to a nonvoting position on the Clark County School Board. Goynes-Brown, Barron and Black did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Miller, the UNLV professor, said the reporting loophole is particularly advantageous in lower-level races, such as Neal’s primary, because the campaigns are much shorter and involve less money. “The best use of your money [in lower-level races] is to just have a quick little burst of mailers or other communications at the very end, right when people are getting ready to fill out their ballots,” Miller said. Other new PACs Other new PACs also raised five figures between before the primary. Every Eligible Nevadan, which backed Washoe County Commissioner Clara Andriola’s re-election bid,raised$50,000, with all the money coming from the group’s national organization,Every Eligible American, which promotes voting access. Andriola, a Republican appointed by Lombardo, cruised to victory in a six-person primary in June despite facing an opposition funded by far-right activist Robert Beadles. Another group called New Voice PACraised$50,000, all from Lorenzo Fertitta, who is one of the majority owners of Red Rock Resorts, which operates Station Casinos. The PAC — which reported spending nearly $50,000 on consultant and advertising costs — is registered toShaundell Newsome, the founder of a Las Vegas marketing firm who used to work as marketing director at Station Casinos.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/were-first-cousins-harris-longstanding-ties-to-nevada-could-benefit-her-2024-run,True,"When Kamala Harris visited Reno and Carson City in the early days of her presidential campaign in 2019, she had high praise for her home state’s eastern neighbor. “We're first cousins,” Harris said duringa busy campaign daythat included two roundtables, a visit to the state Legislature and dinner hosted by a progressive group in Carson City. “I just left Sacramento and just drove in, and I'm reminded of the beautiful border we share and so many other things.” While the interstate relationship between Nevadans and Californians can be anything from symbiotic to resentful, Harris’ view of the relationship has always been familial. The feeling, for many Nevada Democrats, is mutual — at least toward Harris. The state’s Democratic delegates and elected officials werequick to embraceher once President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race Sunday and made Harris his heir apparent, unanimouslyvoting Mondayto pledge their votes to her at the Democratic National Convention. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), who met the now-vice president 15 years ago in California at a conference for current and prospective attorneys general and served alongside her in the Senate, lauded Harris’ long-standing investment in the Silver State. “One thing I know about Kamala Harris is that she understands what Nevada working families need, because of her relationship with Nevada over the years and her involvement working not just with me, but understanding the uniqueness about the two Western states,” she said in an interview. During the 11 months in which her 2020 presidential campaign was active — Harris ultimately dropped out before the Nevada caucus — she visited the state 10 times and hosted 27 events with a wide variety of demographic and interest groups, making her one of the most frequent visitors on the Silver State trail. She’s been to Nevada six times thus far in 2024, and 14 times since becoming vice president. Harris has done events with everyone from the state’s congressional delegation to Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve tostudentsat the College of Southern Nevada. In the past four years, she’s been toLake Meadto talk about climate change, Las Vegas union halls to champion theUnited Steelworkersand theCulinary Union, East Las Vegas torallywith Latino voters and theUniversity of Renoto speak about abortion. Will that familiarity matter come November? Jeremy Hughes, a Republican strategist who was the Pacific regional director for the Trump campaign in 2020, doesn’t think so — especially because Harris is inheriting Biden’s campaign team in Nevada, not coming in with her own organization. “It doesn’t matter one bit,” he said. “They could have picked anybody, and all the Democrats would have got up on stage and said, ‘This is the greatest person of all time.’” Trump wasfavoredin most state-level polls over Biden — and Hughes said he does not think the fundamentals of the race have changed. Two polls of the state released after Biden dropped out of the raceshow Harris trailingTrump by 2 and 10 points, respectively — though they were conducted before Biden dropped out. But Harris supporters say when it comes to Nevada, the vice president hasn’t exactlyfallen out of a coconut tree— she’s put in the legwork to make herself familiar to a wide swath of voters. “I've seen her talk to constituents from every background, from every community — from hospitality workers to nurses to teachers to first responders to business leaders,” Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) said. “I'm confident that with her at the forefront, we are going to do very well up and down the ballot in Nevada.” History in Nevada Much of Harris’ bond with Nevada comes through her long standing affiliation and similar career path with Cortez Masto. The two overlapped for four years as attorneys general of their respective states. Their relationship was forged in the fire of the foreclosure crisis, when they teamed up to investigate big banks. Numerous states were pursuing a settlement with the nation’s largest banks for instances of mortgage fraud and other abuses — a broad approachfavoredby then-President Barack Obama, who sought quick action on the issue. At the time, Harris was in her first year as attorney general, while Cortez Masto was in her fifth. Nevadarankedfirst in the nation for the percentage of housing units in foreclosure, with California second — making the issue all the more potent. Harris and Cortez Masto instead took the risk of pursuing a wider investigation for their states than the federal-state coalition planned to touch, based on their shared conviction that they could deliver more for distressed California and Nevada homeowners. “We had a lot in common, because at that time — particularly when it came to the big banks — we saw a lot of, unfortunately, fraud and scams that were harming our constituents in our states,” Cortez Masto said. “In Nevada and California, as you well know, so much overlaps across the borders.” The two deepened their bond in the U.S. Senate, both winning elections in 2016 and serving together for four years — where they worked on issues of mutual interest such as the restoration of Lake Tahoe. If elected, Harris would be the first Western president since Ronald Reagan, and the first ever Democratic president from west of the Rocky Mountains. That perspective gives her experience with a number of factors — mainly environmental — that affect California and Nevada, from wildfires to water shortages to states dealing withhigh percentagesof federal land. “She'd be good as president for the state of Nevada, because the Western issues are so unique,” Cortez Masto said. Harris has also maintained loyalty from Nevada state legislators over the years. She came to the Legislature in 2019 while running for president, where now-State Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) remembered her taking genuine interest in Nevada-specific issues. “She was authentically interested in what was going on during the legislative session at that point, and what was going on in Nevada, and what we were hearing from Nevada families,” Cannizzaro said in an interview. “That was a question that she asked — ‘What do you hear from Nevada families?’” In an interview, state Sen. Pat Spearman (D-North Las Vegas) said she first met Harris at an Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority event in late 2018 and was impressed by her intelligence, courage and willingness to listen. She was an early endorser of her 2020 presidential campaign, and applauded Harris for maintaining her connections to the state. “We were one of the first places she came to when the Dobbs decision was handed down,” Spearman said, referring to anAugust 2022 event. “She met with electeds at that time and asked our opinion, what do you think about it? What should we do? How do we tackle this? Because this is something that's not right.” Harris alsospent timewith female state legislators in 2023, where she again made an impact on Cannizzaro. The State Senate Majority Leader, who was nine months pregnant at the time, recounted how she began to feel ill during the event. After excusing herself, she said Harris followed her and insisted Cannizzaro receive medical assistance. Harris called her the next day to ask how she was doing, and the next time she saw her, asked how the baby was doing. Cannizzaro, whosharedthe story on X, wrote that it was an example of how the vice president is “the kind of person we should have leading this nation.” Numerous veterans of Harris’ 2020 campaign in Nevada remain in her inner circle. Gabriel Uy, a former Nevada Army National Guard captain who served as her Nevada political director, went to Washington with Harris as her deputy director of public engagement. Ernesto Apreza, her Nevada state director, now works as a vice presidential press secretary. In an email, Uy recalled bringing Harris to his alma mater UNR and introducing her to his mother, who volunteered on the 2019 campaign — whom he noted Harris always remembered on subsequent visits. “VP does her homework and shows up for communities in their communities,” Uy wrote. “When the cameras are on and when the cameras are off, VP is an extraordinary leader and is clear eyed about building a better future.” Notably, Megan Jones, an adviser to Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) for 20 years, is a senior political adviser to Harris and has worked for her since2022. Democrats are banking on Harris’ age and race appealing to Nevada’s electorate — among the youngest and most diverse in the swing states. Even Hughes, the Republican strategist, did not disagree. “Everyone is making the broad assumptions that [since] she's younger, she's a woman of color, that she will do better with younger voters and people of color,” Hughes said. “I don't think that's a wrong assumption.” But the challenge will be activating those voters. Her staff and surrogates will need to work quickly — they only have about 100 days to make a dent in polling averages that show TrumpwinningNevada by nearly 6 percentage points. But that average is based on polling against Biden, and the Harris campaign is hoping that the coalition built by Nevada Democrats over the decades, and won by Biden in 2020, can rally to her cause once again. “As the late great Harry Reid reminded us, if you can win in Nevada, you can win anywhere,” Harris said at aJanuary rallyin East Las Vegas.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rfk-jr-has-enough-valid-signatures-to-make-nevada-ballot-officials-say,True,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s independent presidential campaign has gathered enough valid signatures to qualify for the Nevada ballot, the secretary of state’s office announced Friday. County election officials verified about 22,200 valid signatures in support of the campaign, well more than the roughly 10,000 needed to qualify for the ballot. The campaignsubmittedabout 30,000 signatures earlier this month. Now, the campaign must submit official and alternate slates of electors and a declaration of candidacy with state election officials, which are both underway, said Randell Hynes, the campaign’s Nevada coordinator. The only other obstacle is a still-pendinglawsuitby the Nevada Democratic Party seeking to block Kennedy’s ballot access as an independent. “We’re feeling pretty good about it,” Hynes said in a Friday interview. “Once we get that [lawsuit] behind us, we’ll be good.” The petition’s approval marks a key step for Kennedy’s campaign, which has for months feuded with state election officials over its efforts to land on the Nevada ballot. Its first petition was consideredlikely invalidbecause it did not list a running mate. This decision prompted alawsuitfrom his campaign, though that is now likely rendered moot because his now-approved petition included his running mate. The campaign alsoretractedits second petition after misspelling “United States” twice, an error that likely would not have invalidated the petition. The third petition was the one approved Friday. Kennedy’s entrance into the Nevada race threatens to play spoiler in the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. There has been limited polling since Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee earlier this week, but national pollingappears to showKennedy’s support slightly falling following President Joe Biden’s departure from the ticket. In Nevada,polls showedKennedy hovering around 6 percent of the vote in Nevada while Biden was still in the race. The lawsuit brought by the Nevada Democratic Party argued that Kennedy should be blocked from the ballot because he is running as a member of minor political parties in other states. Nevada law stipulates that independent candidates for any partisan office must not be registered with a political party or proposing to run with a political party. A hearing has not been scheduled in the case in Carson City District Court. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and nephew of John F. Kennedy, initially began his run for president last year as a Democrat before deciding to seek the office as an independent. In public, Kennedy has given no indication that he would leave the race after Biden’s departure. In private,The Washington Postreportedthat he had offered to endorse Trump in exchange for a public health position in his administration, but Trump’s team reportedly denied that offer. Health policy is a popular talking point for Kennedy, who rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic for floating anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. During acampaign eventin Nevada earlier this year, Kennedy pledged that as president, he would tell the National Institutes of Health to take a “break” on drug production and efforts to curtail infectious diseases and accused the “medical cartel” of intentionally making kids sick by shipping drugs to communities across the U.S. During aspeechin Las Vegas earlier this month at FreedomFest, an event billed as the ""world's largest gathering of free minds,” Kennedy said Trump and Biden’s response to the pandemic led to an erosion of free speech. His speech largely focused on being an “anti-establishment” alternative to Trump and Biden, an argument that polls show may be less convincing now that Biden is not in the race. His campaign otherwise includes other mainstream Democratic positions, including a federal $15 minimum wage, transitioning to cleaner energy sources and police reform.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-democratic-delegates-unanimously-back-harris-for-president,True,"Nevada’s delegation to the Democratic National Convention committed its 49 votes to Vice President Kamala Harris — securing the swing state’s slate of delegates for Harris as she attempts to rapidly consolidate support after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race Sunday. On a Monday night call, delegates agreed unanimously to throw their weight behind Harris, who had already garnered the support of a number of Nevada superdelegates — elected officials such as the senators, members of Congress and attorney general. “Vice President Kamala Harris understands Nevada — we were the first battleground state she visited this year — and Nevada Democrats know Vice President Harris has been instrumental to the Biden administration’s historic progress,” Nevada Democrats Chair Daniele Monroe-Moreno said in a statement. Nevada’s delegation now joins Tennessee, New Hampshire, North Carolina and South Carolina in announcing its intent to support Harris at the convention. Nearly all of theFloridadelegates have committed to Harris as well. All 49 of Nevada’s delegates had been pledged to Biden — the landslide winner of the state’s presidential primary in February — given that no other candidate reached the vote threshold necessary to garner the support of a delegate. With Biden exiting the race and releasing his delegates, they became free to vote for any nominee that could earn the support of at least 300 delegates at the Democratic convention. While not an official mechanism — the state party is waiting for guidance from the Democratic National Committee — its pledge moves Harris closer to the 1,976 she will need to become the nominee. As of Monday night, theWashington Postreportedthat Harris has reached the threshold — though no official vote has taken place yet. Nevada’s delegates are a mix of elected officials, party volunteers and local leaders. It includes the state’s two senators and three House members — each of whom endorsed Harris Sunday — as well as several state legislators and the state party chair. No other major candidates have announced an intent to challenge Harris. She can officially become the party’s nominee at the convention in Chicago, which begins Aug. 19.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/harris-mentum-nevada-campaign-sees-more-enthusiasm-volunteers-after-biden-withdrawal,True,"On typical Sundays, the Biden campaign recruits about 150 volunteers to the president’s cause between its 13 field offices in the Silver State. But July 21 was no typical Sunday. On the day that President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, more than 600 Nevadans signed up to help her win in November, according to the campaign. Dozens of first-time volunteers showed up at campaign events. Voters who had previously been unengaged answered texts from the campaign for the first time. Infrequent volunteers committed to more phone banking and canvassing shifts. And in East Las Vegas — where the campaign’s office focused on Latino voters, a group the president hadstruggled to connect with— 12 voters walked in and volunteered on the spot. “Yesterday was something we have not experienced before,” said East Las Vegas regional organizing director Xiomara Alfaro Martinez. “[They were] people we've never met before or interacted with before, but they came in and they were super excited to take action.” Call it Harrismentum, beingcoconut-pilledor just the excitement many Democrats now feel about a nominee unburdened by the fears of age, mental acuity and sagging polling numbers that convinced Biden to exit the race. But staffers for the now-Harris for Nevada campaign — renamed but still operating under email domains with Biden’s name — say the enthusiasm Sunday injected new life into a campaign that had beenlosingin state polls all cycle. While Nevada is a critical swing state that will be key to both parties’ ambitions in the presidential race and beyond, Democratic enthusiasm for Harris was widespread. The vice presidentraised$81 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign, the largest single-day haul in election history — and 60 percent of donors made their first donation of the cycle. Shelby Wiltz, who woke up Sunday as Biden’s campaign manager in Nevada but went to bed as Harris’ by the end of the day, said the campaign decided to keep all of its scheduled volunteer events in place after Biden dropped out. She was “pleasantly surprised” by the number of people who walked into those events “off the street” asking how they could help. “We saw just incredible engagement,” Wiltz said in an interview. “Even folks that we had texted two, three days ago responding saying, ‘Hey, I can come in and do that canvas. I can come in and do that phone bank.’ That's pretty atypical to see that type of response.” It proved to be a rejuvenating day for a Biden campaign besieged by Democratic infighting — if not in Nevada, where delegates and elected officials alike mostly stuck up for Biden, then nationally — for the three and a half weeks since his disastrous June 27 debate performance. On the ground Harris still has her work cut out for her in Nevada. Republicans have been narrowing in on Democrats’ historicvoter registration advantage, trailing by fewer than 30,000 active voters (in November 2020, that lead was nearly 87,000). And while the Trump campaign will need to pivot, it will attempt todefineHarris on the same issues that dogged Biden — inflation and the border. Trump has anaverage polling advantageof nearly 6 points in Nevada, per FiveThirtyEight. In a statement, the Nevada GOP previewed the kind of attacks it plans to launch, saying that Harris has “failed to address critical issues facing our country, from national security to economic recovery.” But Democrats believe the enthusiasm and engagement they saw Sunday portends a shift in their political fortunes. Campaign staff and delegates also say Harris — a Californian who has long had relationships with her eastern neighbors — has unique advantages in Nevada. Harris has already made six campaign trips to Nevada already this year. “There's a lot of energy,” said Tracey Ly, the campaign’s regional organizing director in Northern Nevada. “The rooms just feel like they're going to be fuller.” Ly said several new people in Northern Nevada committed to volunteering or donating, while existing volunteers — excited by the new dynamic of the race — committed to signing up for more shifts and bringing in friends and family members to future events. Others sent her pictures of new yard signs bearing Harris’ name. She expects the upcoming weekend to be one of the busiest of the cycle thus far. Of the six battleground states most likely to decide the election, Trump’s margins wereoften highestin Nevada — giving his campaign so much confidence that, when Biden was his opponent, the Trump campaignconsideredNevada a lock. The Biden campaign had alsoacknowledgedthat its best path to victory was in the Rust Belt. Now, Harris staffers and delegates believe the vice president, the first Black woman and Asian American to be a major party nominee, can activate a demographic that polls showed were hesitant to embrace Biden —votersof color. “[Nevada is] the most diverse battleground state,” Wiltz said. “We are made up of all folks from all walks of life and all backgrounds. And I think that people are particularly excited to elect a president who comes from their communities, who looks like them, who shares experiences with them.” Alfaro Martinez said that based on her conversations with new volunteers yesterday, she is also hopeful that Harris can better engage young voters — another group that Biden had beenstrugglingto hold. Even among Alfaro Martinez’s campaign team in East Las Vegas — which she said is almost entirely Generation Z and voters of color — the momentum shift has been noticeable. “We're all really pumped and excited,” she said. “This is such an amazing thing that happened yesterday.” Delegate takeaways To take advantage of the enthusiasm, Harris must first wrap up the nomination,winninga majority of Democrats’ nearly 4,700 delegates. Among Nevada’s 49 delegates — 36 pledged delegates and an additional 13 superdelegates who automatically get bids — Harris has already locked up numerous votes. More than 20 Nevada delegates have indicated as of mid-Monday they will support Harris, either via public statements, social media activity or in conversations withThe Nevada Independent. Harris’ support is even more concentrated among the elected officials and power brokers going to the convention as automatic delegates. Each of the five federally elected Democrats endorsed her, as well as the state’s attorney general, party chair and vice chair. The DNC ishostinga rules meeting Wednesday to discuss the framework for selecting a new nominee. But withstate delegationsalready committing all of their delegates to Harris, her road to the nomination is off to a quick start. Tanner Hale, a delegate captain and the executive director of Young Democrats of Nevada, said that given Nevada’s swing state status, the delegates would rather proceed slowly — including checking in with the party’s rules and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) — rather than coming out with aquick endorsementsuch as Tennessee Democrats, who unanimously voted to support Harris on Sunday. But he and other delegates expect the Nevada delegation to ultimately back Harris. “This is a really exciting change and I think it jolts us in every key demographic and puts us back into contention in this election,” Hale said. “The rhetoric has been nothing but pro-Kamala.” For Donna West, a delegate from Congressional District 1 who had vigorously defended Biden from age-based criticism online, the pivot to Harris was an easy one to make. She served as Clark County party chair in 2020, and thus was unable to endorse in the state’s highly competitive presidential caucus, but said she was “secretly a member of K-Hive.” Despite feeling sad over seeing Biden withdraw, West said she believes Harris’ candidacy will both energize volunteers and neutralize a key issue. “She’s the right person to take on Donald Trump right now,” West said. “The age issue has turned back now on Trump … so they’re going to now have to deal and grapple with that issue, which I’m kind of glad to see — because the conversation for the last three and a half weeks has been pretty one-sided.” And many delegates are not just supportive, but enthusiastic. Between reposting the president and vice president’s statements, sharing memes or, as one Nevada delegate did, retweeting pop star Charli XCX’sstatementthat, “kamala IS brat,” campaign staff say the momentum, physically and digitally, is palpable. “It's fun to see the excitement,” Ly said. “It's good stuff. We're pumped.” This story was updated at 3 p.m. on 6/22/24 to correct Tracy Ly's last name.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/biden-drops-out-of-presidential-race-nevada-leaders-react,True,"President Joe Biden has dropped out of the presidential race amid concerns over his age and sagging poll numbers, an unprecedented decision in modern American political history. In anannouncementon Sunday, Biden said he had decided not to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination and will “focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” He offered “my full support and endorsement” for Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him on the top of the ticket. In a statement of her own, Harris announced her intention to “earn and win” the nomination. All five Democrats in Nevada's congressional delegation endorsed Harris on Sunday Biden’s decision came afterhe cut a campaign visitto Las Vegas short last week after contracting COVID. But many Democrats publicly and privately had been openly calling for the 81-year-old to leave the race after a disastrous debate performance on June 27 in which he struggled to articulate his points clearly, bringing his age, mental acuity and ability to win to the fore. In recent polling of Nevada, the president hasgenerally trailedRepublican nominee and former President Donald Trump. Biden narrowly defeated Trump in Nevada in 2020, winning by just more than 33,000 votes. The Democratic National Convention, where Democrats will officially designate a nominee, will kick off in Chicago in less than a month. Nevada leaders react Reaction by top Nevada Democrats — who had largely stuck by Biden as others called for him to drop out — was swift. “Time and time again, he has delivered for hardworking Nevadans,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV)saidin a post on X. “I respect his deeply personal and courageous decision and look forward to working with him as he finishes his historic term.” Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) also praised Biden’s “remarkable legacy of accomplishment.” While Rosen and Cortez Masto did not immediately endorse Harris, they did so Sunday afternoon. RosensaidHarris is “highly qualified for the job, and she’s ready to lead on Day 1,” while Cortez Mastosaidshe “has the experience and proven record to be our next President.” Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), who appeared with Biden in Las Vegas on Tuesday even as other members of Congress avoided him on the campaign trail, thanked Biden for his service and tied himself to the president’s legacy. “From creating millions of jobs to tackling gun safety, President Biden has been an outstanding and important lifelong public servant,” Horsfordsaidon X. “I’m proud of all we’ve done together.” And in ajoint statementwith Rep. Greg Meeks (D-NY), Horsford, through the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, endorsed Harris, saying she would make an “excellent” president.  As the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Horsford will be a key political ally on Capitol Hill for the party’s eventual nominee. A Horsford spokespersonconfirmedthat Harris called Horsford shortly after Biden endorsed her. In a press call with reporters Sunday night, Horsford said that when he spent time with Biden in his district on Tuesday, he said the president had been committed to staying in the race — an attitude Horsford supported. But he said that he agreed with Biden’s decision to step aside, a choice that Horsford said reflected the very character and sense of integrity that had made him a Biden supporter. But he believes Harris is “prepared and qualified” to rebuild the coalition that Biden carried in Nevada in 2020, which he identified as including Latino voters, Black voters, the fast-growing Asian American population, organized labor, the white working class and policy-focused independents. Horsford added that Harris will inject new life into the race — which to this point had featured a rematch between two aging presidents. “This is a generational change that is going to create a level of energy, excitement and engagement with voters from across the spectrum — independents, nonpartisans, Republicans who are looking for a more pragmatic way and Democrats who are looking for a new vision,” Horsford said. “That’s what the Vice President is offering.” Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) also endorsed Harris, saying she “look[ed] forward to supporting her at the top of the ticket.” Lee, who had beenopenly skepticalof Biden remaining on the ticket after his debate performance, thanked him for his “impactful” presidency and for his decision to step aside, which she called an act of “immense patriotism and selfless leadership.” Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), a Biden-Harris National Advisory Board member, commended Biden for his service and decision in a statement. “Ultimately, he chose to put the interests of this nation above himself,” Titus, who went on to endorse Harris, said. “That is the essence of a great President.” Ina poston X, Attorney General Aaron Ford, a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, said Biden was “a patriot who puts country over self, and I'm so very grateful for his service.” In a separate post a few minutes later, FordendorsedHarris with two photos and the comment, “Let’s go!! #TeamKamala!” Nevada Democratic Party Chair Daniele Monroe-Moreno, who signed a letter with other swing state party chairs backing Biden just this morning, praised Biden as “transformational president” and affirming his choice of Harris as vice president. Monroe-Moreno is a delegate to the convention as well. State Treasurer Zach Coninealso wroteon X, saying Biden “is one of the most consequential leaders in American history,” crediting the president with bringing “our economy back from the pandemic.” The Nevada Republican Party said in a statement that Biden’s decision to leave the race “underscores the deep divisions and uncertainty within the Democratic Party.” Harris and Nevada In statements after Biden’s announcement, several Nevada Democrats thanked Biden for his service and quickly endorsed Harris — a fixture in neighboring California politics for decades who has maintained a frequent presence in Nevada as vice president. She has madesix tripsto the Silver State just this year. Recent polling from theAP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Researchshows that 6 in 10 Democrats believe that Harris would do a good job taking over Biden’s spot as the party’s presidential nominee. Harris has also been a longtime political ally of Cortez Masto. The two served as attorneys general of California and Nevada, respectively, overlapping for four years from 2011 to 2015. In that time, they partnered to negotiate mortgage settlements with banks after the foreclosure crisis. Both women successfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2016, serving together for four years until Harris became vice president. Megan Jones, a longtime Nevada operative for Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), is also among Harris’ inner circle, serving as a senior political adviser. Senate race With Biden off the ticket, the dynamic of the Nevada Senate race has been upended. Throughout the race, Biden’s polling numbers had remainedsignificantly belowRosen, inciting fears among Democrats that his presence on the ticket could drag her and other incumbents down. In a lengthy statement, Rosen praised Biden's record without endorsing Harris and while trying to keep the heat on her opponent, Sam Brown. She said voters would have a “clear choice” between the parties, one of which is “focused on restoring reproductive rights” while the other contained “far-right MAGA extremists like my opponent.” In a statement, a National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) spokesperson called Harris a “far-left radical” and implied she would have the same issues as Biden in swing states. Brown, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, said in a post on X that in not calling on Biden to resign, Rosen — who had not called for Biden to exit the race — fell short. “Jacky Rosen failed to use her position as a Senator to lead with common sense,” Brown said. “The whole world could clearly see he is not fit to be President and should never have run for reelection.” Brown, like many other Republicans, also called on Biden to resign immediately. What comes next? Nevada held its presidential primary in February, which Biden, running against no serious challengers, won with nearly 90 percent of the vote. Per Nevada Democrats’ delegate selection plan, each delegate signed a pledge to support the presidential candidate. As such, Nevada’s 49 delegates to the Democratic National Convention are pledged to Biden. While Biden endorsed Harris, delegates previously pledged to Biden do not automatically transfer to his preferred candidate. Once released, Nevada’s delegates are free to support any candidate on the convention floor who has qualified. Qualified candidates must receive the written support of at least 300 delegates or the votes of at least 600. Nevada’s 49delegatesare a mix of elected officials, party activists and volunteers that include the U.S. senators, members of Congress, attorney general, state party leaders, some state legislators and Democratic National Committee members. They make up about 1 percent of the 4,672 delegates who will attend the convention. Several Nevada delegates immediately expressed support for Harris, fromrepostingendorsementstochanging profile photosto include Harris.  Horsford, a delegate himself, said based on initial conversations following Biden’s announcement, he believes Harris will win the nomination. “I've heard from a ton of delegates and constituents and voters — people who have sent me texts and emailed, called me — who are energized, excited, engaged and want to know what they can do,” he said. If Democrats do not coalesce around a candidate before the convention and choose to vote among qualified nominees on the floor, the first ballot will only include pledged delegates, a group that includes 36 members of Nevada’s delegation and leaves out automatic or “superdelegates,” including federally elected Nevadans and the state’s DNC representatives. Ballot access Different states have different rules for when presidential nominees must be finalized in order to appear on the ballot. In Nevada, state law requires each major political party to provide their presidential and vice presidential candidates’ names to the secretary of state by 5 p.m. Sept. 3. Ballot access in Nevada, therefore, should not be a problem, so long as Democrats emerge with a presidential ticket by the end of the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 22. Campaign infrastructure Campaign infrastructure is a different story. Given that Harris’ name is on the ticket with Biden, Federal Election Commission rules dictate that the funds in Biden’s campaign account could be transferred to her easily. Biden’s robust campaign in Nevada — which includes more than 80 staffers and 13 offices — are paid by the campaign and the Democratic National Committee. If Harris takes over the ticket, they can simply continue working for the campaign and being paid for it.However, if another candidate besides Harris emerges at an open convention, the legal machinations of transferring funds becomes murky. Republicans would likely challenge any attempts to continue to use campaign funds, which might need to betransferredback to donors.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/d-c-download-how-sam-brown-nevada-fared-at-the-republican-national-convention,True,"Happy Saturday and a special shoutout to everyone who took the time to meet with me in Reno! I had an excellent reporting trip to the Biggest Little City in the World (and some lovely runs along the Truckee River and Lake Tahoe) — but it means I missed the party in Milwaukee, where Republicans formally nominated Donald Trump for president on Thursday. But there was still plenty of Nevada news to break down! So instead of the usual format, I’m going to jump right to The Nevada Angle: a few takeaways from the Republican National Convention. The Nevada Angle Sam Brown was one of several U.S. Senate hopefuls to take the stage Tuesday night in Milwaukee, providing him with a prime opportunity to introduce himself to a national audience — and donor base. Brown’s shortspeechfocused on themes of restoring hope, buoyed by his story of surviving an explosion in Afghanistan that burned 30 percent of his body. “I know the importance of hope in difficult times,” Brown said, before recounting getting severely burned after driving over an improvised explosive device in the Kandahar region while deployed with the Army in 2008. “Through the pain and anguish of recovery, and the years that followed, I never lost hope.” He presented his candidacy for Senate as an opportunity to bring hope to Nevadans suffering from rising inflation and anunemployment ratepersistently higher than the national average. And he dinged his opponent, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and President Joe Biden for “wanting to raise your taxes while dodging their own.” (Trump, of course, refused to release his taxes for years, andpaidno income tax in 2020.) Brown, as he has all year, tied himself closely to the party’s nominee, saying he would stand beside Trump as a senator to achieve his goals, including ending taxes on tips. Brown ended his speech with a national security appeal, urging audience members to look at his face, heavily scarred from burns. “This is the high cost of war,” Brown said. “If Joe Biden stays in office, more service members will pay this price.” It’s a line Brown has used before, toprotestSenate consideration of requiring women to register for the draft. This time, he deployed it to build a foreign policy case for Trump, saying that Biden’s leadership had made the likelihood of U.S. troops dying in battle more likely. More service membersdiedunder Trump’s term than Biden’s; however, the U.S. is providing weapons for conflicts in Ukraine and Israel. When Trump took the stage Thursday night, he began by recounting the assassination attempt and pledging to be a president for all Americans. What followed was more typical — a 90-minute speech, sometimes straight from the stump, often meandering, full of anecdotes, asides, criticism of Democrats and Trump-isms. But amidst diatribes on inflation and the border, Trump also took some time to talk about Nevada. Trump detailed his plan to endfederal taxation on tips— first announced in a Las Vegas rally. Trump had previously said he got the idea for the policy from a Las Vegas waiter, but he told the story in more detail on Thursday. He recounted that while dining at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas on the Strip, his waitress mentioned that the government was “after me all the time on tips.” When Trump asked how the government was able to track her cash tips, he learned from her that most tips were added to the check these days. “Everybody, everybody loves it,” Trump said of his proposal, which issupported by both of Nevada’s senators. “Waitresses and caddies and drivers and everybody. It’s a large, large group of people that are being hurt badly. They make money, let them keep their money.” Trump also promised to return to Nevada soon and mentioned he is up 14 points in polls — an exaggeration overpolling averagesbut in line with an early May poll byThe New York Times. Trump also seemed to briefly go off-script to talk about the Nevada Senate race during a section on Afghanistan, pivoting to Brown when mentioning injured troops from the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. “[Brown] paid the biggest price probably ever paid by anybody that is running for office, and I think he is going to do great,” Trump said. “He’s running against a person that is not good, not respected. A total lightweight.” We won’t know of the financial ramifications of this shout-out until next quarter’s campaign finance reports, but I can imagine that Brown will be able to fundraise significant sums — particularly from people who are not closely following Nevada’s Senate race but tuned into the convention — from his moment in the spotlight. Trump said his name six times. He did not mention Rosen by name, but still referred to her as a “total lightweight” — giving Rosen an opportunity to fundraise off of Democrats’ Trump fury, their biggest source of money and votes since 2016. Rosen alreadypostedabout the line on X with a fundraising appeal and sent one to supporters via email as well — meaning she thinks she can bank on the moment. Around the Capitol 💰What to do about Menendez —Should Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) be allowed to collect his government pension after a felony conviction? Rosen has a bill that would stop that. TheNo Corruption Act, passed through the Senate last year, would prevent members of Congress from taking their pensions if convicted of felonies related to their time in office. The bill got momentum last year because of trials and tribulations of former Rep. George Santos (R-NY); now Rosen and co-sponsor Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) are renewing their push in the wake of Menendez’sconviction. 🏘️Federal money for the Historic Westside—The Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority and the City of Las Vegas will receive $50 million in federal funds to create more housing in the Historic Westside’s Marble Manor Apartments. The grant takes a holistic approach to housing, funding a community garden, grocery store and other community improvement-oriented projects. What I’m Reading News 4 Nevada:Interview with Nevada Sen.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-voter-id-ballot-question-qualifies-for-2024-ballot,True,"The Nevada’s Secretary of State’s Office confirmed Friday that a proposed ballot measure that would require voters to show a form of ID before voting has enough valid signatures to appear on the November ballot. The office reported Friday that supporters had turned in 131,590 valid signatures, and passed the threshold of signatures needed from each of the state’s congressional districts (25,591) to qualify the measure for the ballot. Backers of the initiative had turned in more than 179,000 signatures to state and local election officials last month. ""We are elated to have met another massive milestone in this process; now it is up to Nevadans,” said David Gibbs, chairman of the Repair The Vote PAC, which is backing the initiative. The ballot question would amend Nevada’s Constitution by requiring in-person voters to provide valid photo identification and for mail voters to provide a personally identifiable number — such as part of a driver’s license or Social Security number — alongside their signature. Nevada does not require voters to provide any type of identification before voting, but each voter is required to provide a signature that must match the one in the state’s files. Opponents of the proposal have criticized the voter ID requirements as a de facto unconstitutional poll tax, because it typically costs money to obtain a form of identification. The measure survived a legal challenge filed earlier this year, with thestate Supreme Court in May rulingallowing the initiative to move forward but declining to address several of the legal arguments at the “preelection stage.” Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has publicly championed voter ID as a concept. A pro-Lombardo PAC, Better Nevada, reported contributing more than $1.5 million in the last quarter to anaffiliated PACthat worked to gather signatures for the initiative. Efforts to amend the state Constitution require two affirmative votes, so the measure would be placed on the 2026 ballot if it passes this year.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-tosses-gop-suit-that-sought-to-end-nevadas-post-election-day-ballot-counting,True,"A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by former President Donald Trump’s campaign and its allies that sought to end Nevada’s practice of counting mail ballots received up to four days after Election Day. In a Wednesdayruling, Chief U.S. District Court Judge Miranda Du dismissed the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs — which also included the Republican National Committee (RNC), Nevada GOP and a Nevada voter — did not have standing to file the lawsuit, which alleged the state is violating federal election law by accepting and counting mail ballots postmarked by Election Day but received as many as four days after the election. TheAssociated Pressfirst reported news of the dismissal Wednesday. “The Court finds that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Nevada mail ballot receipt deadline and dismisses this case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction,” Du wrote. Claire Zunk, the RNC’s spokeswoman on election integrity, said in a statement that it will be pursuing further legal action on the case and that “a liberal judge unjustifiably dismissed our case.” Du was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in a59-39 vote. Charles Lutvak, a Biden campaign spokesperson, said in a statement the lawsuit was “completely meritless” and the dismissal “protects eligible Nevada voters' right to vote and have their vote counted.” The Biden campaign had intervened in the case andcalled for its dismissal. The secretary of state’s office declined to comment. The dismissal marks the second legal defeat in the past month for the RNC and Nevada GOP. Another federal lawsuit brought by the groups alleging inconsistencies in state voter rolls wastossed outlast month, though that suit was amended and refiled earlier this month. These lawsuits are part of a push by the RNC to pursue court battles regarding election administration in swing states, largely by filing a deluge of lawsuits. The mail ballot counting suit relates to a2021 lawthat was staunchly opposed by Nevada Republicans. The law permanently expanded universal mail voting in the state and allowed any mail ballot postmarked on or by Election Day to be counted as long as it is received within four days of Election Day. In the 2022 election, more than 45,000 mail ballots were counted after Election Day in Clark and Washoe counties, the overwhelming majority of which were received the day after Election Day, according to data from thesecretary of state’s office. These totals represented about 6 percent of all Clark County ballots and 3 percent of all Washoe County ballots. In the race for U.S. Senate that year, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) defeated former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt by about 8,000 votes. Plaintiffs in the GOP lawsuit said they had standing to file the lawsuit because they alleged the law is harming them electorally, citing data that shows mail voting to be more popular among Democrats than Republicans. GOP politicians had discouraged mail voting in prior elections based on the false claims that the method is rife with fraud, but have reversed course and embraced a “bank your vote” strategy this election cycle. In Du’s dismissal of the lawsuit, she argued that the Republicans’ standing claims were unconvincing. First, she said that the GOP groups “failed to establish” that the mail ballot counting deadline gives Democrats an unfair advantage, and that any so-called advantage “appears to be equally available to, but simply less often employed by, Republicans.” Additionally, Du determined that the Republican groups did not sufficiently show that any electoral harm would be redressed by changing the deadline to count mail ballots. The lawsuit also alleged that the mail ballot deadline requires them to divert resources to conduct more election activities after Election Day, which would be more expensive and time consuming. Du was also unconvinced by this argument. “The record is devoid of evidence, however, that Organizational Plaintiffs would not round up mail ballots in substantially the same manner if they were due at county clerks’ offices on Election Day instead of four days later; they would just conduct those same activities a few days earlier in November or over a shortened period of time,” she wrote. Du also ruled the Republican voter who was also listed as a plaintiff lacked standing because the mail ballot counting deadline “does not specifically disadvantage any one voter.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/biden-tests-positive-for-covid-during-las-vegas-trip-cancels-speech,True,"President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19 Wednesday afternoon while visiting Las Vegas. Biden visited a restaurant in East Las Vegas early Wednesday afternoon, and was scheduled to later speak at a conference for UnidosUS, a Latino advocacy organization, but that was canceled after his diagnosis, the organizer of the event said. He was also scheduled to participate in a community event after the conference. The president visited the Lindo Michoacán restaurant for a planned exclusive interview with Univision. After reporters were ushered outside at around 1:30 p.m., they waited for more than an hour and a half in vans outside of the restaurant, far longer than had been planned. A White House statement said that the president was “experiencing mild symptoms” and will self-isolate at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where he will “carry out all of his duties fully during that time.” His doctor said he was given a dose of Paxlovid and that his temperature is normal but he had upper respiratory symptoms, including a runny nose and “non-productive cough.”. Janet Murguía, president and CEO of UnidosUS, said she spoke with Biden and he expressed “his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon.” “So of course we understand that he needs to take the precautions that have been recommended and he did not obviously want to put anybody at risk,” she said in a statement. Biden has been in Las Vegas since Monday andspoke at an NAACP conferenceTuesday and an economic summit with Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV). Biden lasttested positivefor COVID in 2022.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-legislative-fundraising-close-in-key-races-millions-pour-into-ballot-initiatives,True,"State campaign finance reports released by Monday’s deadline showed a tight fundraising battle across the races most likely to determine whether Nevada Democrats can secure a legislative supermajority. Across 10 contested legislative races throughout the second quarter, Democratic and Republican candidates each led the fundraising race in five of them. Meanwhile, PACs affiliated with Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo continued to pour money into the coffers of prominent GOP candidates, and those supporting ballot questions on ranked-choice voting, abortion rights and voter ID donated millions of dollars to the PACs behind the initiatives. The latest campaign finance reports offer the penultimate look at fundraising data for Nevada political candidates and committees ahead of the general election, covering April through June. It also provides more insight into the head-to-head fundraising data for key legislative races after last month’s primaries winnowed each race to one Democrat and one Republican. The stakes are high. Democrats control 13 seats in the 21-member state Senate (one short of the two-thirds supermajority needed to override a veto) and 28 seats — a supermajority — in the 42-member Assembly. The outcome of a few key races could change whether Lombardo’s ability to veto bills stands, as a veto can be overridden by a two-thirds vote in each legislative chamber. In total, more than $2.3 million was donated to the candidates running in the 10 most competitive legislative races — identified byThe Indybased on district partisanship — and groups poured more than $10 million into organizations either supporting or opposing the various ballot initiatives. This was bolstered by a $5.75 million haul by a group supporting the ballot question on ranked-choice voting and open primaries, and $1.4 million raised by a Lombardo-affiliated PAC supporting the voter ID initiative. Click below for a closer look at the campaign finance reports. Legislative races Pro-Lombardo PACs Ballot initiatives Other Across the 10 most competitive legislative races, six of the candidates who raised more money in the second quarter are of the opposite party than the seat is currently held by. Here’s a closer look at how it’s shaking out: Millions of dollars poured into Lombardo’s campaign machine through several PACs that support the governor and his slate of legislative candidates. The most public-facing one is the Better Nevada PAC — the group that in 2022 received millions of dollarsfrom Lombardo’s top campaign donor, hotel baron and space enthusiast Robert Bigelow — which last year unleashedattacks againstlegislative Democrats as being embroiled in a “culture of corruption.” Better Nevada PAC raised more than $2.3 million — bolstered by a $1.6 million donation from the Las Vegas Sands and The Venetian, a company founded by late GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson and is now led by his widow, Miriam Adelson. It also received $100,000 from Uber. The PAC spent $2 million in the quarter, mostly on its own consulting and advertising costs, but also contributed to Republican candidates running in nine of the 10 most important races (all except Ginsburg, whose race is among the more likely Democratic victories). Additionally, Better Nevada transferred $1.4 million to a new PAC called theBetter Nevada Ballot Advocacy Committee, which formed in May and is focused on supporting a voter ID ballot initiative. The initiative gathered more than 179,000 signatures in support and is awaiting approval from county election officials, which is due to state officials Thursday. Another Lombardo-affiliated PAC is theNevada Way PAC, which raised $630,000, with a $250,000 donation coming from Boyd Gaming Corporation. This PAC donated money to candidates in eight of the most important legislative races (all except Ginsburg and Buck). Stronger Nevada PAC, a pro-Lombardo group run by former Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, also paid for in-kind media production services — valued at $5,000 each — for 11 Republican candidates, including Washoe County Commissioner Clara Andriola and many of the legislative candidates. In addition to the Lombardo-backed group on voter ID raising $1.4 million, three other groups supporting ballot initiatives received at least $1 million in donations from April through June. Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, the group behind the ballot initiative to establish a constitutional right to abortion in Nevada,raisedabout $1.4 million, roughly the same amount raised last quarter. This included $550,000 from theTides Foundation, a powerful left-leaning philanthropic fund with ties to the Democratic megadonor George Soros, and $150,000 from Think Big America, a nonprofit tied to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker that had previously given $1 million to the initiative. Quinn Delaney, a prominent Democratic donor, also gave $250,000 to the group. Vote Yes on 3 — a new group supporting Question 3 on the November ballot, which would establish open primaries and ranked-choice voting for non-presidential races —raised$5.75 million in the quarter. The haul included $4 million fromArticle IV, a Virginia-based group that bills itself as a nonpartisan group focused on improving democracy. The group also received $1.5 million fromUnite America, a philanthropic fund dedicated to election reform, and $250,000 from Wynn Resorts. The other seven-figure donation was made by Uber, which gave $1 million to Nevadans for Fair Recovery, a group backing the ballot initiative that seeks tocap attorney feesin Nevada at 20 percent of all settlements and awards. The ride-sharing company previously gave $4 million to the group. This initiative is not vying for a spot on the November ballot, but is instead seeking to be addressed in the 2025 legislative session. If it gets enough votes to do so and the Legislature does not act on it, the question would be put in front of voters in the 2026 election. A group of Nevada trial lawyersfiled a lawsuitearlier this year seeking to block the petition, arguing its intention is to stymie sexual misconduct suits against Uber. Its initial effortfailed, but it has been appealed to the Nevada Supreme Court. Citizens for Justice, the political arm of the Nevada Justice Association (the group behind the lawsuit),raised$2 million and spent about $340,000 in the second quarter, but it’s unclear how much of this was related to the petition. This haul is six times as much as the group’s first quarter fundraising total.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/after-primaries-nevada-democrats-lead-fundraising-battle-across-congressional-races,True,"With the primary finalized and congressional contests now set, Democrats — and a self-funding independent — maintained massive financial leads over their Republican opponents through the end of June. As she has all cycle, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) led the pack,raising$7.6 million in the three months of the quarter, per Federal Election Commission filings — a record for the second quarter in Nevada. Her Republican opponent, Sam Brown, had his best quarter as well,pulling in$4 million. Each Senate candidate raised more than their 2022 counterpart, a portent for the 2024 cycle breaking the spending records set just two years ago. With several wealthy Republican candidates losing primaries in Congressional Districts 1 and 3, Democrats’ cash advantages grew exponentially. Reps. Dina Titus (D-NV) and Susie Lee (D-NV) raised more than 10 times more than their GOP counterparts in the quarter, while Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) beat Republican opponent and former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee in second quarter fundraising by a more than 5-to-1 ratio. Each of the three incumbent Las Vegas House Democrats posted their best fundraising quarters of the cycle. Lee raised about $1.09 million, with Horsford close behind at about $1.03 million. Titus was third with about $495,000 raised. None of the three  Republican challengers to the Las Vegas Democrats raised more than $200,000 this quarter. Congressional District 2 is a different story. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), who has represented Northern Nevada since 2011, is facing self-funded independent candidate Greg Kidd, after no Democrats filed to run for the seat. Kidd loaned his campaign $1 million this quarter. Unlike candidates who loan their campaigns large sums but are often hesitant to actually spend it, Kidd spent nearly $1 million this quarter as well. Senate Rosen’s financial advantage has allowed her to outspend Brown on the airwaves. Rosen — who did not face a competitive primary — has spent or placed $27 million in ads, per AdImpact, while Brown has booked over $1 million worth. Both have been and will continue to be supported by outside groups. Brown’s $4 million quarter was his best of the cycle — but the $3.6 million between his total and Rosen’s is the biggest gulf between them of any quarter as well. Rosen’s financial strength — as in other quarters — has come through small-dollar donations. Her campaign said 96 percent of donations were less than $100, with an average online donation of $37. Democrats across the country have typically outraised Republicans during the last several election cycles on the strength of ActBlue, their digital donation platform. Brown raised $1.46 million in unitemized donations — contributions of less than $200 — in the second quarter. Rosen has now raised just more than $2 million from Nevadans since entering office in 2019, which is less than her haul from California ($3.8 million) and New York ($2.4 million). Brown has raised $1.2 million from Nevadans, followed by California ($547,000) and Texas ($405,000). Democrats dominating in House races Lee and Horsford each raised more than $1 million in the second quarter, a significant sum for House candidates and a valuable asset inracesthat analysts say are competitive but should favor the Democratic incumbents — especially after redistricting gave all three seats a Democratic lean. All three Democrats are now financially dominating their races after independently wealthy candidates Dan Schwartz and Marty O’Donnell lost in the Congressional District 3 primary and Flemming Larsen fell short in Congressional District 1. Drew Johnson, thethink tank analystwho emerged from the crowded primary to take on Lee, reported raising nearly $105,000 to Lee’s nearly $1.1 million in the second quarter. The difference in cash on hand is even more stark. Johnson, who loaned his campaign $300,000 during the primary, spent more than he took in this quarter — leaving him with less than $50,000 in his war chest. Lee, by contrast, has nearly $3 million in available cash, which has allowed her to make a seven-figuread reservationfor the fall. To be competitive, Johnson — as well as his counterparts in Congressional Districts 1 and 4 — will likely need to rely on outside spending to even the advertising gap. But thus far, the major organizations associated with House Republican leadership haveyet to makeany financial commitments in Nevada and areskittishabout their prospects in the state. Of the three House Democrats, Titus has typically been the worst fundraiser. Her $495,000 haul was her best yet of the cycle, but less than half of what Lee and Horsford pulled in over the same timeframe. But Titus, who kicked up her fundraising last cycle in her first race under new maps that put more Republicans into her Strip-based district, faces the worst-funded major-party congressional candidate in Nevada: Mark Robertson. Robertson raised less than $50,000 this quarter, and has $100,000 on hand to Titus’ more than $1.3 million. The contest is a rematch of 2022, in which Tituswonby 5.6 percentage points. Robertson was boosted in 2022 by outside spending from groups such as House Republican leadership-connected super PACCongressional Leadership Fund, whichdropped$8.6 million to try to defeat Titus. CLF has made no reservations in Las Vegas this cycle, compared to $15 million made by this point in 2022. Of the Las Vegas Republican challengers, former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, running against Horsford in Congressional District 4, raised the most — $182,000. Despite being outraised, he outspent Horsford this quarter in large part because he faced a competitive primary against Air Force veteran David Flippo. Lee spent more than $780,000 this quarter, using his own money (he loaned his campaign more than half a million dollars) to go up on television. Horsford has been able to save his money for the fall and place $1.6 million in ad reservations. His war chest sits at more than $2.2 million, while Lee is down to less than $39,000 — the lowest total of all congressional candidates. Finally, Amodei, who has won seven straight elections, is facing a unique election this year against a self-funded independent. Kidd, a pro-business, pro-choice entrepreneur, immediately started airing ads after Amodei easily won his primary. Per AdImpact, Kidd has spent nearly $240,000 on three television ads, touting his political independence and support for abortion rights. Amodei, who raised nearly $330,000 and has an $100,000 cash on hand advantage, has not made any ad buys. Amodei has never exclusively faced a nonpartisan candidate in a general election, but he has handily beaten Democrat opponents at every opportunity. He won his last election by nearly 22 percentage points.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-vegas-biden-woos-black-voters-with-promises-of-economic-equity-civil-rights,True,"President Joe Biden kicked off his Tuesday visit to Nevada by courting Black voters — a vital voting bloc —  at the NAACP conference and an economic summit with Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV). Members of the NAACP crowd cheered Tuesday afternoon as Biden made his entrance at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, chanting “four more years.” During his speech, Biden emphasized the importance of economic equity and civil rights, promising to protect them during his presidency. He criticized former President Donald Trump for stripping Black Americans of health care, minimizing the Black workforce and fostering white supremacy nationwide. If re-elected, Biden said that he would call on Congress to enshrine into law theJohn Lewis Voting Rights Actand restore Roe v. Wade within the first hundred days of his presidency. “I’ll do everything the NAACP stands for,” Biden said. Biden’s visit arrives at the heels of the attempted assassination of Trump, the most serious attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate since 1981, and a shaky debate performance that’s called his leadership into question and prompted calls to replace him on the top of the ballot. Following the shooting, Biden called for updated security measures at campaign events and postponed his Monday visit to Austin, Texas. “It’s time for an important conversation,” he said. “The politics in this country have gotten too heated. We must reject not only political violence, but violence of any kind.” Although 92 percent of Black Nevadans supported Biden during the 2020 election,enthusiasm for the president has dwindled.  Nevada has the third highest growing Black population in the nation; a population that has become an increasingly important constituency during this year’s nail-biter race. Trump has also made attempts to court Black voters, ​​having the most success with the youngest. In the morning, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), the chairman of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, kicked off the president's second event of the day — an economic summit in North Las Vegas. The congressman has stood behind Biden as other Democrats have questioned his ability to lead, calling such doubts “ageist” and “ableist.” Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), up for re-election, notably did not appear alongside Biden today, similar to other major Democratswho’ve sidesteppedthe president in recent weeks. Horsford lauded a new affordable housing plan announced by the Biden administration this afternoon. The plan would place a cap on rents for major landlords and build 2 millions homes nationwide. Horsford said the plan had a special significance to him with funds going to build homes “half a block away” from where he grew up — a neighborhood that he called “overlooked.” Biden’s proposal could help secure as many as 15,000 additional affordable housing units in Nevada and would include awarding a $50 million housing grant to the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority and the City of Las Vegas. Biden’s housing announcement was thesecondtime he has delivered a second-term housing vision this year while in Las Vegas, an apt place for such policy discussions. Nevada isshortof nearly 80,000 affordable units and Las Vegas is among the cities with thehighest percentageof rent-burdened residents in the country. The president’s plan was aimed at a national audience and a Nevada-specific one. He called for a 5 percent cap on rent increases for corporate landlords, with violators losing access to certain federal tax breaks available to rental property owners. Such a policy would require an act of Congress, likely necessitating a Democratic trifecta — but the Biden campaign is hoping it can inspire voters in a time when Biden’s age, rather than his policy agenda, has been garnering more attention. “We are sending a clear message to corporate landlords,” Biden said. More affordable housing needed Less likely to make national headlines but of paramount importance to the Las Vegas Valley is Biden’s plan to use federal land for affordable housing. Growth in the West, and particularly in Nevada, has often been limited because of the high proportion of public lands — about 80 percent of land in the state is owned by the federal government. Las Vegas is encircled by public land, and the Southern Nevada Home Builders Associationestimatesthat it will run out of new land to build housing in eight years. While environmentalists have protested that the region should prioritize denser housing on existing land,DemocratsandRepublicansalike have been interested in using public land for new housing. The White House also announced Tuesday that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the primary landowner in Nevada, will move into the public comment period on selling a 20-acre parcel to the county at $100 per acre, the largest sale of land dedicated to affordable housing in the nearly 26 years since the passage of the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act (SNPLMA), which governs public land disposal in the Las Vegas Valley. The sale is made possible because the administrationstreamlinedthe sale of several public parcels in Clark County earmarked for affordable housing. Clark County estimates that 150 affordable homes could be built on the land, located on the north side of Cactus Avenue between Buffalo Drive and Rainbow Boulevard, for households earning less than 80 percent of area median income. In addition, BLM will soon propose an 18-acre sale to the City of Henderson, which estimates the parcel could hold 300 new affordable units. It will also consider an additional 562 acres for an estimated 15,000 units that Southern Nevada municipalities have identified as having affordable housing potential within the SNPLMA boundary  where the BLM already has the right to facilitate land sales. The announcement was met with cheers from congressional Democrats and aligned groups, including immigrants rights’ group Make the Road Nevada and the Nevada Housing Justice Alliance. Meanwhile, the Nevada Realtors and former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, who is running for Congress against Horsford, criticized the proposal, saying rent control is a failed idea and that more public land needs to be made available for all forms of housing, not just those that are deemed affordable. “While I appreciate the release of some federal land, this is not enough,” Lee said. Trump’s agenda criticized Biden also repeatedly called out Project 2025 — a proposed policy agenda for Trump's presidency — suggesting that it would lead to the erosion of worker’s rights and civil protections. The project proposes to cut federal funding for schoolsteaching “critical race theory,” and de-emphasize the role of white supremacy and slavery in U.S. history. The plan would alsodeport undocumented people en masse and place them in campsas they await departure. It would “repeal all we’re doing,” Biden said. His NAACP speech was sprinkled with references to episodes of racial violence such as the murder of George Floyd and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The Trump rallying cry of “MAGA,” Biden said to the audience, “want to deny you your freedom.” Yet, despite such messaging and a chaotic campaign month, Biden ended on a positive note. “I’ve never been more optimistic than I am now about the nation,” Biden concluded. “We just have to remember who we are.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/washoe-county-certifies-recount-after-refusing-to-do-so-last-week,True,"A week after the Washoe County Commission made national headlines for refusing to certify the results of a primary election recount, commissioners reversed course and approved them Tuesday. Washoe County Commissioner Clara Andriola, a Republican who was appointed by Gov. Joe Lombardo to the board last year, initiallyvoted against the certificationlast week, citing “a lot of hiccups” with the process. Facing backlash and guidance from state officials and the district attorney’s office, Andriola requested the reconsideration. She and Commissioner Mike Clark, a Republican, joined the board’s two Democrats to certify the recount results in a 4-1 decision late Tuesday. Andriola, reading from prepared remarks, said she met with the interim registrar's office and her previous concerns had been addressed. Andriola added that the district attorney's office had provided clarifying direction on the nature of her duties as commissioner to canvass the election returns, making it clear to her that the “action is ministerial only and required.” “It is my crystal clear understanding that canvassing elections, whether it's a primary, general or a recount, as defined in statute, is a legal duty and affords no discretionary provision to refuse,” Andriola said during the meeting. “In America, Nevada and right here in Washoe County, we can and must do everything we can to restore faith and confidence in our elections.” Clark said he received similar guidance from the district attorney's and attorney general's offices that certifying the vote was a mandatory ministerial function, and that he could otherwise face criminal prosecution. He added that he was “forced to vote to certify this election” even though he views it as “nonsensical.” “There is nothing in the statute that allows a commissioner to question the validity of the results, whether there was any irregularity in the recount,” Clark said. “I must follow the law.” Voting rights advocates andseveral state officialshave criticized the county’s decision not to certify the recount results as an act that could fuel the election denialism movement. The recounts stem from the state’s June 11 primary election. Three losing candidates requested a recount in their races, which were paid for by far-right provocateur Robert Beadles, who spent about $150,000 to fund the recounts (one of which was canceled after a candidatewithdrew her request). The recount results did not change the outcome of any of the races, but under Nevada law the results still needed to be certified within five working days of the recount’s completion. This “canvassing” of votes — the process of declaring, examining and certifying election results — has historically been noncontroversial, but election conspiracy theorists have sought to hijack the typically ministerial process as a way of casting doubt and holding up election results. The lone commissioner who voted in opposition Tuesday — Jeanne Herman, a Republican — said she would not vote to certify the recount results because of unspecified reports of fraud she’s heard. Herman did not provide proof of her claims. “There are hills to climb on, and there's hills to die on. This might be one of those,” Herman said. “I cannot vote for this.” Herman and Clark are connected to Beadles, who participated in a protest of about 30 people before the meeting and testified during public comment, which included nearly 90 public commenters during the almost seven-hour meeting. Beadles and other protesters shared unfounded claims of election fraud during the meeting, criticized the county’s election processes and called on commissioners to hand count the primary ballots even though state law stipulates recounts must be conducted in the same manner as the original election. Read More: Washoe County commissioners vote not to certify primary election recounts The Tuesday vote followed a petition filed by Attorney General Aaron Ford on behalf of Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar requesting the Nevada Supreme Court tocompel the board to actto certify the results. Last week, Aguilar called the decision not to certify the recount “unacceptable.” In a statement emailed late Tuesday, a spokesperson for the secretary of state’s office celebrated the certification of the vote, but said it does not address the underlying legal question sent to the Nevada Supreme Court — the “appropriate place to resolve the issue.” “Washoe County’s initial decision not to canvass the election results could have consequences in Nevada, and across the country, if this issue is not addressed appropriately,” she wrote. The Supreme Court has not yet weighed in on the matter. The decision not to certify the election results marked Washoe as the third county in a battleground state to do so this election cycle. The other two counties wereDelta County, Michigan, andFulton County, Georgia. Nevada Administrative Codeoutlines counties' statutory obligation to certify election results, specifying that any election recount “must be canvassed within 5 working days after the completion of the recount.” The Washoe County District Attorney’s Office did not respond to a request for comment about the certification taking place on the ninth business day after the recount finished. Mary Kandaras, the Washoe County chief deputy district attorney, told commissioners ahead of the vote that the board does not have any investigatory power and must canvass the vote. “As many people have noted, the commissioners were told that they should vote their conscience,” Kandaras said. “And, well, generally, that is true in almost every vote; it's not true in the case of the canvass."" Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, said that though Nevada law clearly states that counties must certify the votes, the consequences of not doing so must be clarified. He warned that if the court system does not offer clarification, other counties could follow suit. “I'm expecting, as part of the election denialism movement, that there are going to be at least a few county commissions statewide that will end up obfuscating and rejecting existing law and simply moving toward noncertification as a means of holding up the election,” Haseebullah said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/horsford-to-appear-with-biden-at-black-voter-event-tuesday,True,"Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) will appear with President Joe Biden at a North Las Vegas event Tuesday, a welcome sign for a president whom high-profile Democrats avoided at a rally in Michigan on Friday. Horsford, the chairman of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), has stood behind Biden as one of his most stringent defenders even as other Democrats have expressed misgivings about the president’s ability to win the election or called on him to drop out. On Monday, heaffirmedBiden’s candidacy, noting he had been selected by Nevada voters, and laterreferringto criticism of the president as “ageism and ableism.” The two will attend a summit in North Las Vegas hosted by Vote to Live Action Fund, a Black voter mobilization group. The event is part of Biden’s two-day swing to Las Vegas to shore up support among Black and Latino voters, two key voting blocs of his 2020 coalition whom polling has shown may beless enthusiasticabout the president this cycle. Other CBC members and Nevada political leaders are expected to attend. Horsford’s willingness to appear with Biden is a gamble that other prominent Democrats facing tight races have largely been unwilling to take. In Detroit, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Gary Peters (D-MI), retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and likely Senate candidate Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) alldeclinedto attend the rally. In Wisconsin the prior week, in-cycle Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI)skippedBiden’s event. As the CBC hasremainedBiden’s best line of defense on Capitol Hill, Horsford’s enthusiastic backing has been notable given that he’s aFrontlinemember of the Democratic caucus himself, meaning the party considers his seat competitive. Horsford, whose district encompasses northern Clark County, including North Las Vegas, and rural central Nevada, won his race in 2022 by about 5 percentage points. This cycle, he faces John Lee, former mayor of North Las Vega. In addition to the summit with Horsford, Biden will address the NAACP National Convention on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. On Wednesday, his focus will shift to Latino voters — he will speak to the UnidosUS annual conference at the MGM Grand and discuss how the Latino uninsured rate hasdroppedand investments in Latino small businesses havegrownduring his administration. Biden will then attend a community event through the campaign.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/dc-download-what-nevada-democrats-are-weighing-amid-calls-for-biden-to-drop-out,True,"Can President Joe Biden beat former President Donald Trump? Is he fit enough to serve four more years? And do voters’ opinions on the latter question impact the former? Those are the million-dollar questions on Nevada Democrats’ minds as they weigh whether to publicly call on Biden to drop out of the presidential race. As representatives of a swing state, they have extra incentive to make the right call — a Biden underperformance at the top of the ticket could drag down the four Democrats running for federal re-election this year. I’ve been away from D.C. this week (and will be in Reno next week if readers have any recommendations!) — quite the news cycle to be gone during — but with constant leaks and a bevy of public polling, I thought I’d parse through some of the data to try to get into the minds of the delegation’s Democrats this week. The News of the Week: What next for Biden? Biden’s Thursday solo news conference — which lawmakers were watching with bated breath — had plenty for his boosters and detractors to cling onto. He gave nuanced, lengthy answers to complex foreign policy questions, landed some hits on Trump and showed energy when discussing gun control, in particular. But he made a number of trademark gaffes — including referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Vice President Trump” — spoke softly at points and wasn’t the type of inspiring political speaker voters hope for in a presidential candidate. In short, Democrats remain in the same bind as they’ve been in. Many Democrats’ concern about Biden’s presence on the top of the ticket is not whether he’s been a good president or can continue to be, but whether voters believe it. Poll after poll has shown him trailing Trump in key battleground states. This phenomenon has been most pronounced in the Silver State, where Trump has led throughout the entire cycle, to the point that the Trump campaignno longerconsiders it a swing state, but rather a lock for the former president. It’s statistics like those that are likely scaring the Nevada officials who are running beneath Biden on the ticket — most notably Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), who has stopped short of calling for Biden to drop out butexpressed skepticismthat he can convince voters of his ability. Meanwhile, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, has been one of the president’s strongest supporters on the Hill, despite facing similar circumstances to Lee in a competitive district — though Lee’s has traditionally had closer margins. The Nevada Angle FiveThirtyEight’spolling averagehas Trump leading in Nevada by an average of 4.6 percentage points. Most polls since the debate have Trump winning beyond the margin of error of the poll, but do not show significantly different numbers from where the race stood before June 27. In May, a Morning Consult/Bloombergpollfound Trump leading Biden by 5 percentage points. Two months later, the same groupfoundTrump with a 6 percentage point lead in early July — essentially in the same position. Of course, the Biden team’s goal with the debate wasn’t to keep his polling numbers stable — it was to improve his standing. In acampaign memoobtained by several media outlets, the Biden campaign acknowledged its most straightforward path to victory was defending the ‘Blue Wall’ states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The Biden campaign’s conclusions follow the evidence available in public polling, as well — the race is closer in the Rust Belt than in the Sun Belt. “Right now, winning the Blue Wall states — MI, WI, and PA — is the clearest pathway to that aim, but we also believe that the sunbelt states are not out of reach,” thememosays. “The consensus across internal and public polling is that the toplines in the Blue Wall states largely remain within the margin-of-error.” Another question Nevada Democrats will surely be considering is whether the problem is Biden-specific. Downballot polling suggests that perhaps it is. Throughout the cycle, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) has led GOP opponent Sam Brown in polling, despite Biden’s poor performance. In the last two months, polling firms have found Rosen with leads ranging from 2 percentage points (from a Republican pollster) to 14.  (Rosen outrunning Biden by such significant margins isfairly unlikely.) The split between the presidential and Senate races — in Nevada and other swing states — raises the question whether another presidential candidate would fare better. It appears the Biden campaign is interested in this question as well; the New York Times reported that the campaign istestingHarris’ strength against Trump in new polling. AWashington Post-ABC News-Ipsos pollreleased Wednesday provided a new piece of data for Democrats to mull over. Nationally, the poll found that though 56 percent of Democrats want Biden to step aside, he is tied with Trump at 46 percent vote share. (Of course, the election will be decided in the swing states, such as Nevada, rather than by national survey.) Interestingly, the vice president outperforms her boss, leading Trump by 2 percentage points. Is it time for Democrats to embrace what can be,unburdened by what has been? That’s just one poll, and I’d be interested to see what her numbers look like in battleground states. But a Harris candidacy is definitely a potential parachute. The Impact As the smallest of the swing states, with just six electoral votes, neither campaign’s pathway to 270 hinges on Nevada. But those six votes get a candidate that much closer to victory in an election where the margins could be slim. And as I mentioned, a Trump victory by the margins that some polls suggest could upend the congressional delegation. So, you could say the stakes are high! Around the Capitol ☀️Titus vs. heat  —Rep.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/kennedy-touts-his-anti-establishment-approach-at-freedomfest,True,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is bidding to appear on the Nevada presidential ballot, spoke Friday at FreedomFest offering himself as an alternative to the major party candidates. The environmental lawyer’s appearance came at Caesars Forum in Las Vegas where he delivered the keynote address to the nonpartisan conference focused on “liberty.” At FreedomFest, Kennedy presented himself as an “anti-establishment” alternative to former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. He repeatedly accused Trump and Biden of colluding with mainstream media outlets to erode public trust and sow national division, emphasizing Biden’s lackluster debate performance. “The current disarray in the Democratic Party is a symptom of something much much larger,” Kennedy said. “We have a sitting president who is barely able to string together a sentence.  The crises I want to address are our crisis of trust and the connected crisis of a divided nation.” At the national and state level, the Kennedy campaign has been mired in controversy and legal hurdles. Kennedy hasrepeatedly petitionedto get on Nevada’s ballot, struggling to meet eligibility requirements. Kennedy’s independent presidential campaign said it hassubmitted sufficient signaturesto place him on the November general election ballot in Nevada, and county election officials have begun a signature verification process. The Nevada Democratic Party hassuedto keep Kennedy off the ballot, alleging his affiliation with other political parties violates state requirements for independent candidates. The Democrats’ lawsuit comes amid fears that Kennedy’s inclusion on the Nevada ballot could prove costly for Biden. Polls show Trump leading Biden in Nevada by an average of about4 percentwhen no third-party candidates are included, but by about5 percentwhen third-party candidates are counted. Kennedy consistently receives about 10 percent of the Nevada vote when matched against Biden and Trump, according to polls. Kennedy has faced similar struggles to get on the ballot in other states, as well. He is onlycurrently eligible to run in Utah, Michigan, California and Hawaii. William Shaw, 25, who works in marketing said that though he supports Kennedy’s campaign, he is doubtful the campaign “will go anywhere.” Despite this, Shaw said he believes that Kennedy provides an important counterpoint to more “establishment” presidential candidates. “To have someone who is willing to call out corporate and bureaucratic rot in the system, and who actually has the language for it, unlike Trump, I think that is pretty refreshing.” Shaw said. Others in attendance agreed. Justin Moore, a farmer and airline worker, said that though he was hesitant to give RFK his vote, there was “no way in hell” that he’d vote for Biden and that he doesn’t back all of Trump’s policies. Moore said an RFK book helped elucidate that “the government is always trying to seize power. During the pandemic, they revealed themselves.” Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, rose to prominence during the pandemic because of his anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. Kennedy has said“there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective”— a comment he hassince tried to walk back— however, the World Health Organizationreportsthat vaccines “are very safe” and prevent adverse effects from harmful diseases. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine theories provided a major talking point during his FreedomFest speech, as he repeatedly claimed that Trump’s and Biden’s response to the pandemic led to an erosion of free speech. The shutdown violated freedom of worship, he said, and the government censored public health information, spreading what he called “medical misinformation.” Left out of the most recent presidential debate, Kennedy used Biden’s debate performance as a launchpad to air grievances against mainstream media. Halfway through his speech, members of the crowd started chanting “hog the debate.” Directly after his speech, FreedomFest staged its own version of the presidential debate, featuring Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Party members Chase Oliver and Randall Terry. “Each day the media offered a new truth contradicting the truth of the day before,” Kennedy said about the Biden-Trump debate. The nephew of John F. Kennedy and son of Robert F. Kennedy, RFK Jr., 70, has framed himself as inheriting his family’s esteemed political legacy, though some family members havecriticized his policy viewsand distanced themselves from his campaign. The assassination of his uncle and father has contributed to Kennedy’s deep mistrust of the government. In the past, he’s said he’s found“overwhelming evidence” that the CIA was involved in JFK’s death. Earlier in the day, theWashington Postand NBC News reported that Kennedy sent a text message of apology last week to a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s when she worked as a babysitter for the family. Over the years, Kennedy has been accused of several instances of infidelity during both of his marriages. The candidate has acknowledged having “skeletons in his closet” and conceded that “I’m not a church boy.”“RFK Jr. continues to offer dismissive and inadequate excuses in response to these sexual assault allegations,” said Matt Corridoni, a spokesperson for the DNC,in a statement. “Like Donald Trump, RFK Jr. is not only plagued by scandal and a closet full of skeletons, but he has no shame or regard for the women he assaulted and harassed.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-cortez-masto-join-cruzs-bill-to-end-federal-taxes-on-tips,True,"Nevada’s two Democratic senators rarely agree with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) — let alone former Republican President Donald Trump. But Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) signed onto a bill Thursday that Cruz proposed to end federal taxation on tips, becoming the first Democrats to co-sponsor the policy in either chamber. It’s a move approved by the influential Culinary Workers Union Local 226, a longtime ally of the senators. Trumpproposedexempting tips from taxation for wage earners at a June rally in Las Vegas, saying he got the idea from a cocktail waitress. It was an apt location for the pitch — known for its hospitality industry, Nevada has thehighest concentrationof tipped wage earners among all states. In statements, both senators said eliminating taxes on tips was just one of many solutions — including raising the federal minimum wage and better enforcing the tax code against corporations and the ultra-wealthy — they support for helping tipped workers and achieving tax fairness. But by joining Cruz’s bill, the senators are acknowledging the importance of the issue in Nevada and indicating their willingness to support a Republican-led effort. “Nevada has a higher percentage of tipped workers than any other state, and getting rid of the federal income tax on tips would deliver immediate financial relief for service and hospitality staff across our state who are working harder than ever while getting squeezed by rising costs,” Rosen said. [For more on the potential impacts and politics of Trump’s proposal, click here.] Trump’s proposal has created strange political bedfellows. Althoughmany Republicans, including Cruz and Nevada GOP Senate candidate Sam Brown, embraced the idea, others worried about how the loss of revenue might negatively impact the deficit. Many Democrats, including Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), expressed openness to the idea but said they mistrusted Trump to execute it. Rosen’s campaigndingedBrown, who claimed the proposal was his idea as well, for promoting “empty talking points” after Trump first floated the policy, while maintaining her support for tax relief for tipped workers. The Culinary Union, the powerful Democratic-aligned hospitality workers union in Las Vegas, said that though tip earners need relief and the group is supportive of Cruz’s bill, the idea was little more than a campaign Hail Mary from Trump. However, with support from the senators, Culinary Union secretary-treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement that the union was pleased with the proposal. ""Culinary Union applauds Sen. Rosen, a former Culinary Union member and tipped worker, and Sen. Cortez Masto for joining bipartisan legislation to provide relief to hospitality workers in Nevada,” Pappageorge said. “Real solutions are what workers rely on and we are proud to have senators who are fighting to deliver real results for working families.” Cruz’s bill has attracted four Republican co-sponsors in addition to the Nevada Democrats, including National Republican Senatorial Committee chair Steve Daines (R-MT), who said hebelievesthe proposal will help Republicans make inroads with workers.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/ag-asks-supreme-court-to-order-washoe-county-to-certify-recount-results,True,"One day after the Washoe County Commission refused to certify the primary election results, the secretary of state filed an emergency petition with the Nevada Supreme Court to compel the board to act. Thepetition, filed by the attorney general on behalf of Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, followed anunprecedentedvote by Washoe County Commissioners to not certify the recount results. Three of the commission's Republican members voted not to certify the election, while the two Democratic members voted in opposition. “This vote has the potential to set a dangerous precedent for elections in Nevada. It is unacceptable that any public officer would undermine the confidence of their voters,” Aguilar, a Democrat, said in a joint statement with Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford on Wednesday. “These commissioners have failed to do their part in this process under law.” Nevada lawspecifies that a recount must be conducted in the same manner as the original vote tabulation. Any losing candidate can seek a recount, but state law requires them to front the cost and receive a refund only if the recount changes the outcome in their favor. Recounts can be requested within three working days of the county or statewide canvass and must start within five days of receiving the demand. A recount must be completed within five days once it has commenced. Nevada Administrative Codeoutlines counties' statutory obligation to certify election results, specifying that any recount election “must be canvassed within 5 working days after the completion of the recount.” In 2022, after Esmeralda Countydelayed approving the results of a primary, Ford said state law made county lawmakers’ roles “ministerial only,”indicatingthey must perform election certification in a prescribed manner “without using one’s own judgment or discretion.” In the joint statement Wednesday, Ford said that by not certifying the vote, the Washoe County Board of Commissioners “failed to perform its duty to certify the authenticated results of the recount,” and “failed to meet the expectation of Nevada voters that the election results would reflect the votes of the majority.” Aguilar said the requested recounts of the June primary races were conducted by the Washoe County Registrar of Voters within the appropriate time frame and revealed that the initial count for each race had been off by one vote for each candidate. This confirmed the initial primary results because more than 1,000 votes decided the races, he said, adding the only missed step was the county commissioners’ certification of the recount. “The importance of this issue cannot be overstated,” Aguilar said. “This law is nonpartisan, and this response is about something far more serious than any political stance or office: the democratic process itself.” The joint announcement comes after Washoe County Commission Chair Alexis Hill, a Democrat,announced Wednesday afternoonthat the commission would hold a revote on the decision not to certify the primary election recount results. Republican Commissioner Clara Andriola, who was appointed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo and had voted against the certification earlier this week, requested the do-over.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/cooler-heads-have-prevailed-commissioners-to-reconsider-vote-not-to-certify-primary-recount,True,"Washoe County Commission Chair Alexis Hill, a Democrat, announced Wednesday afternoon that the commission would reconsider its decision not to certify the primary election recount results, as requested by Republican Commissioner Clara Andriola, who had voted against the certification earlier this week. The commission's reconsideration of the canvass of the votes will take place July 16. The announcement follows anunprecedented 3-2 vote Tuesday, in which the commission’s three Republican commissioners chose not to certify the results of the recounts. The two Democratic members of the commission voted to certify the election. “Cooler heads have prevailed, and Commissioner Andriola emailed me this morning to ask for reconsideration of the canvass recount vote to be placed on the agenda,” Hill toldThe Nevada Independent. “This vote was a violation of our Democratic norms and the canvass is actually a statutory requirement.” Considered a swing vote on the five-member county commission, Andriola, who was appointed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, said during Tuesday’s meeting that her decision not to certify the election, including her own winning race, had to do with alleged “concerns of mishaps.” She cited an election violation complaint that she said was filed with the county. Officials with the secretary of state have not confirmed or responded to questions about the complaint. In a text message responding to a request for information about her change of mind, Andriola said she has no further comments to add to Hill’s Wednesday announcement because the agenda item is still pending. Though a revote will take place, Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, toldThe Nevada Independenton Wednesday that clear guidance is needed about what would occur if a county refuses to fulfill its obligation to certify a vote. “If I was the secretary's office or the attorney general, I'd be filing a case right now regardless of whether or not they're revoting to ensure that that guidance is clear. These counties are acting recklessly when it comes to the law,”  Haseebullah said. “Individual county commissioners shouldn't be empowered to hold up an entire election cycle, and that's exactly what they're doing there.” He described Andriola’s last-minute decision to change her mind as “absolutely shocking and disgraceful,” adding that it also confuses voters and spreads more election denialism. “You can't vote to undermine [the election] one day, and then next week, vote to change it,” Haseebullah said. “In effect, all that's going to happen now is their election denialism movement is going to end up shouting again about how they're martyrs.” During Tuesday’s meeting, dozens of people who opposed the certification alleged there were issues and other problems during the recount process. Among those opposing the certification was far-right activist Robert Beadles, who paid about $150,000 for three recounts. One of the recounts was canceled after the candidatewithdrew her recount request. Nevada lawspecifies that a recount must be conducted in the same manner as the original vote tabulation.

UnderNevada Administrative Code, counties have a statutory obligation to certify election results, specifying any recount election “must be canvassed within 5 working days after the completion of the recount.” Hill described the opposition as a “minority of [Washoe County’s] population” calling for a hand count (which was not possible during the recount) and spreading misinformation. “I'm very supportive of making sure that folks who have concerns, they can get them out and that they can be researched,” Hill said. “I'm very proud of our office, and I hope that this vote doesn't muddy the water for our community members.” This story was updated 7/10/2024 at 3:44 p.m. to include a statement from Commissioner Clara Andriola.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-focused-on-my-own-re-election-campaign-declines-to-say-if-biden-should-drop-out,True," In a statement Wednesday, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), declined to weigh in whether President Joe Biden should step aside over concerns about his age and mental acuity, instead simply saying that the president is a better choice than former President Donald Trump. “There is a clear choice for voters this November between an administration focused on lowering costs for the middle class, standing up for democracy, and protecting reproductive rights, and Trump’s MAGA agenda that would ban abortion, cut Social Security and Medicare, and devastate hardworking families,” Rosen said. Rosen, up for re-election in a Senate race expected to be one of the closest in the country, has arguably the most to lose from a Biden underperformance at the top of the ticket. Polls currently show her running several points — up to 15 pointsin some surveys ahead of the president, a margin that has not been seen in Nevada in two decades. Rosen’s comments come as congressional Democrats weigh whether or not to encourage Biden — suffering from a low approval rating and questions over his ability to defeat Trump after a faltering debate performance — to drop out of the race. At stake are control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, which members such as Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO)fearwould be lost if Biden remains as the Democratic candidate. By declining to weigh in on Biden’s fitness as a candidate, Rosen’s statement threads the needle betweenmore enthusiastic membersof the Nevada delegation, such as Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), whosuggestedthe criticism of the president is ageist and ableist, and Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), who has been skeptical since the debate. Other Senate Democrats in tough races have, like Rosen, tried to maintain distance from Biden and the presidential race. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) hasemphasizedthat the decision to drop out lies with Biden and that while she supports the entire Democratic ticket, she is focused on her own re-election. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) hasremained coy,saying only that voters have concerns about the president, while Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) hassaidBiden needs to prove that he’s up to the job for four more years. Like her counterparts, Rosen has sought to separate the Senate race from the presidential. “I'm focused on my own re-election campaign, continuing my record as one of the most bipartisan and independent senators, and putting politics aside to get things done for Nevada,” she said. Regardless, Republicans — including her opponent Sam Brown — have hammered Rosen over her affiliation with Biden. ""Joe Biden was a disaster on the debate stage, and he's been a disaster for working Nevada families,” Kristy Wilkinson, Brown’s communications manager, said in a statement. “He is clearly unfit to lead. Yet Senator Jacky Rosen continues to blindly support and endorse Joe Biden and his destructive agenda, proving she prioritizes what DC wants over what Nevadans need.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/jacky-rosen-raises-record-7-6-million-in-second-quarter,True,"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) reported raising $7.6 million from April through June, a record for money raised in the second quarter for a U.S. Senate race in Nevada. The haul broke the record set by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), who raised more than$7.5 millionin the second quarter of 2022, a reporting period that saw asurge in donationsdue to the fall of Roe v. Wade. Rosen raised $5 million in the first quarter, much more than the $2.2 million raised by Sam Brown, Rosen’s Republican opponent in the November general election who was running in a GOP primary at the time. Brown has not revealed his fundraising total for the second quarter. As of late May, Rosen had more than $10 million in cash on hand, while Brown had around $2.5 million on hand. Pollsshow Rosen with a sizable lead over Brown, while President Joe Biden istrailingformer President Donald Trump. Rosen is one of several Democratic senators said to be at risk of losing their seats this year, an outcome that could prove dire for Democrats given their narrow majority (51 out of 100 seats) in the chamber. A Senate majority is necessary to confirm Supreme Court and cabinet nominees, among other key responsibilities. Rosen’s campaign said that more than 33,000 donors in the second quarter were first-time contributors, including donors from all 17 Nevada counties. The average online donation was $37, and 96 percent of the donations were $100 or less, according to the campaign. The second quarter haul brings Rosen’s total money raised since entering office in 2019 to more than $30 million. Specific details on Rosen’s donor base and spending will be released Monday, which is the deadline for federal campaigns to release their quarterly finance reports.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-las-vegas-kamala-harris-defends-biden-vies-for-asian-american-support,True,"In an event launching an effort to court Asian American voters, Vice President Kamala Harris in Las Vegas on Tuesday once again defended President Joe Biden by contrasting him with former President Donald Trump’s “chaos, fear and hate.” The appearance marked Harris’ sixth trip to Nevada this year and second in the 11 days since Biden’s faltering debate performance spurred calls from members of his own party to step down as the presidential nominee, with Harris seen as the most likely alternative. Her roughly 15-minute speech was a typical campaign address, focusing on abortion rights and Trump’s rhetoric, but it also relied on some of the campaign’s messaging strategies since the debate. Harris reiterated the phrase that has become a sort of rallying cry for Biden’s supporters: “When you get knocked down, you get back up.” She also said the press had insufficiently covered the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling that grants immunity to presidents for official actions, another common message from Biden’s defenders that the media had focused too much on Biden’s age in recent weeks. “The past few days have been a reminder that running for president of the United States is never easy,” Harris said. “But the one thing we know about our President Joe Biden is that he is a fighter.” The context of this appearance differed from Harris’ visit 10 days ago, which was the day after the debate and there was widespread uncertainty about Biden’s ability to beat Trump. By Tuesday, the tides appeared to be shifting in the president’s favor, with the top Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate publicly backing Biden. He also received key backing from members of the Congressional Black Caucus, which is chaired by Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV). Horsfordpublicly declaredhis support for Biden as the nominee Monday, and he was soon followed bySen. Catherine Cortez Masto. Hours later, Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) wouldn’t go that far,sayingshe had “serious concerns” about Biden, but that it was his decision whether to run. Aside from the debate-inspired remarks, Harris sought the support of voters who are Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI). The voting bloc is growing in Nevada and overwhelmingly supported Biden four years ago, according toexit polls. Harris, whose mother was born in India, is the first woman of South Asian descent to serve as vice president as well as the first black woman to hold the position. Harris heralded the passage of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, alawinspired by the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic, that makes it easier for people to report hate crimes on the state and local levels. She said Trump “consistently incites hate, including toward the AANHPI community” but refused to use the language that Trump used. As president, he called the coronavirus the “China virus” and the “kung flu.” “Someone who vilifies immigrants, who promotes xenophobia, someone who stokes hate should never again have the chance to stand behind a microphone and the seal of the president of the United States,” she said. She also took aim at Project 2025, an agenda for a future Republican administration by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The plan calls for giving the president more power over the federal civil service and the Department of Justice, dismantling the Department of Education, implementing sweeping tax cuts, restricting abortion and reducing efforts to limit the effects of climate change. Trump recently has tried to separate himself from the plan, but many of his allies and aides have ties to it. “Donald Trump wants to turn our democracy into a dictatorship, and the Supreme Court basically just declared he can get away with it,” she said referencing the high court’s immunity ruling. What do attendees think? Erika Marquez, a 36-year-old organizer, has been an active proponent of the Biden-Harris campaign, even though she’s ineligible to vote due to her Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status. Last year, she almost died battling diabetes, becoming comatose. She says if Trump were in office, she’s doubtful she would have had the same level of health care access crucial to her survival. “As undocumented mother of four, I feel that it's important to have people in office who are actually seeing us for who we are,” she said. During the event, Marquez spoke to Harris and called the experience “empowering.” If Harris stepped in to replace Biden, Marquez says she would welcome her candidacy. “Why not just push her a little more and have her as president?” she said. “There comes a point where a woman needs to hold the position.” For Carlo Miciano, 26, the rally was comforting, full of faces that he said resembled his own. To Moreno, Harris provides crucial representation for the AANHPI community, which he thinks lacks broad political representation. “She puts a face to what the community looks like,” he said. “Many people when they think of Asians, they think of East Asians, not Southeast Asians. She helps represent the totality of what the Asian community is.” Not everyone was as hopeful as Marquez or Miciano. Tina Olsen, 66, a retired Las Vegas resident, called the event “kind of sad.” Given recent doubts about Biden’s campaign, she said she expected the room to be packed and bustling. Still, Olsen’s backing of his campaign remains steadfast. “I have not doubted [Biden’s] performance. He’s aging like the rest of us,” she said. Whether Biden or Harris, attendees reiterated that a vote for either candidate goes beyond support for them as individuals. For many, they said it is part of a larger ideological struggle. “I’d vote for Kamala. I’d vote for Biden,” said Noah Kern, a Vegas resident. “I don’t have a preference.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/washoe-county-commissioners-vote-not-to-certify-primary-election-recounts,True,"In an unprecedented 3-2 vote Tuesday, Republican Washoe County commissioners Clara Andriola, Mike Clark and Jeanne Herman chose not to make the results of two contested June 9 primary recounts official after an initial motion to certify the election failed. The decision followed hours of vitriolic public comment during which dozens of people who opposed the certification alleged there were issues and other problems during the recount process. ""Given the fact that it's not the first time that we've heard a lot of concerns of procedures, a lot of concerns of alleged mishaps, I think have been a term that’s been used a lot or hiccups … I am not going to certify the vote,” Andriola said. “I believe that it warrants further investigation.” The decision to not certify the results appears to violate the Nevada Administrative Code, which stipulates that counties have a statutory obligation to certify election results,specifyingany recount election “must be canvassed within 5 working days after the completion of the recount.” Washoe County Interim Registrar Cari Ann Burgess told reporters Tuesday that the matter now goes to the Nevada secretary of state. A spokesperson for the secretary of state did not immediately respond to a request for comment or queries about what happens next. Andriola, who is considered a swing vote on the five-member county commission which consists of two Democrats and three Republicans, said her decision not to certify the election, including her own winning race, had nothing to do with county staff. She referenced an election violation complaint that she said was filed with the county and said it was vital to address election doubts. “I’m not an election denier,” she said. “It’s really to look at the investigative part of the allegations, that in this case, what has formally been filed and I don’t know how many others have formally been filed.” Officials with Washoe County said this is the first instance they know of where the county has not certified the vote. Asked about the complaint Andriola referenced, county officials said the secretary of state’s office is looking into the matter but did not offer any specifics. Two of the Republican commissioners who voted not to certify the election — Mike Clark and Jeanne Herman — have connections to far-right election provocateur Robert Beadles, who paid about $150,000 for the three recounts, one of which was canceled after the candidatewithdrew her recount request. By contrast, Beadles has criticized Andriola for voting with Democrats and attacked her on his blog and in mailed pamphlets, portraying her as “Clara the Clown.” Beadles celebrated the vote in ablog postpublished Tuesday afternoon titled, “We Won A Battle…” He said the decision gives him time for the courts to rule on candidates’ requests for a hand recount and investigate his allegations of voter fraud. “Today was a victory, well-deserved and well-earned for the people of Washoe County and the candidates,” Beadles wrote. “It’s all due to God, and all of you who wrote or showed up and spoke truth to power. Thank you.” The decision marks Beadles’ only victory since hehelped oustthen-sitting Republican Washoe County Commissioner Bob Lucey in favor of Clark. Unofficially, therecountfor the contested elections for County Commission District 4 and School Board Trustee District G yielded the same results as the primary — with Andriola and Perry Rosenstein winning. Andriola carried 43.34 percent of the vote in the commission race, and Perry Rosenstein had 34.64 percent of the votes in the school board election — roughly the same percentages as before the recount. UnderNevada law, a recount must be conducted in the same manner as the original vote tabulation. Any losing candidate can seek a recount, but state law requires them to front the cost and receive a refund only if the recount changes the outcome in their favor. Recounts can be requested within three working days of the county or statewide canvass and must start within five days of receiving the demand. A recount must be completed within five days once it has commenced. In a comment earlier in the meeting, Andriola said more transparency is needed in election processes. She said that change needs to take place at the legislative level, expressing support for policies such as allowing for voter identification and alternative methods of conducting recounts.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lee-horsford-split-on-confidence-in-biden-as-democratic-nominee,True,"Nevada’s congressional Democrats agree that former President Donald Trump must be defeated in the upcoming presidential election. But is President Joe Biden the right candidate to do so? On that point, they’re less aligned. Ever since Biden’s faltering debate performance June 27, in which he sounded hoarse, frequently lost his train of thought and misspoke several times, voters and Democratic officials alike haveworriedthat the president, already the oldest commander in chief in American history, may not be up to the task of beating Trump and serving another term. A handful of Democrats in Congress have evencalled onBiden to drop out of the race, amidst concerns that a poor performance at the top of the ticket could harm Democratic chances in the Senate and House as well. Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), aFrontline Democratwho represents a swing district she won by 4 percentage points in 2022, did not go so far as to push Biden toward exiting. But in a statement toThe Nevada Independent, Lee said that she had “serious concerns” about the octogenarian — and that her fears have not been assuaged. “I expressed serious concerns after the debate and I still have them,” Lee said. “Whether President Biden remains on the ticket is his decision, not mine. He needs to prove to the American public that he can do the job for four more years.” Lee’s stance was far more skeptical than that of her congressional neighbor Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), who is also a Frontliner, albeit in a district where DemocratsoutnumberRepublicans by a greater margin than Lee’s. Horsford, the chair of the influential Congressional Black Caucus, positioned himself more firmly in Biden’s camp in a statement Monday morning, noting that Nevada voters had chosen Biden as their nominee in February’s presidential primary. Horsford echoed a point the president made to Hill Democrats in aMonday lettercalling for speculation about his candidacy to end and suggesting thatreplacing himwould undermine voters’ will. “President Joe Biden is the nominee and has been selected by millions of voters across this country, including voters here in Nevada,” Horsfordsaid. Biden won the Nevada primary with 89 percent of the vote — though he faced no serious challengers. The one member of Congress who didchallengehim during the primaries, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN), did not file to run in the Silver State. Horsford’s approval was quickly followed by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), the only member of the delegation not facing re-election this fall. Cortez Masto, who said she was “proud to stand with Joe Biden” the day after the debate, bear-hugged the president again Monday. “Joe Biden won the Democratic nomination in a landslide because he fights for working people in this country,” shewroteon X. “He’s always had Nevadans’ backs, whether it’s on the picket lines, protecting our personal freedoms, or lowering costs — now it’s time for us to have his.” While Lee was far more critical than her fellow Nevada Democrats, she noted that in a race between Biden and Trump, the president remained the “clear” choice for her. “I do know that President Biden has brought America historic infrastructure investments, new jobs, and lower prescription drug and health care costs,” she said. “Trump is a 34-time convicted felon who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, and is a threat to our democracy, national security, and Nevadans’ fundamental rights.” While Democratic hand-wringing has spilled into the public eye, most Republicans remain united behind Trump as their nominee — who, at 79 years old, is also a senior citizen, prone to incoherent rambling and frequentlyfell asleepduring his criminal trial. Absent from the conversation so far is Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), who is facing re-election in what is expected to be one of Democrats’ toughest seats to defend this cycle. While Rosen spoke at a Biden-Harris campaign event before the vice president the day after the debate, she onlyusedBiden’s name once. Throughout the cycle, she has been careful to maintain distance from the president, whose approval rating has remained underwater in Nevada for more than a year and whom she is running several points ahead of inpollingaverages.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-nevadas-laws-on-commercial-addresses-in-voter-rolls,True,"In the past two months, a conservative law firm focused on election integrity has filed two lawsuits in Nevada alleging commercial addresses have been included illegally on voters’ registrations. The Public Interest Legal Foundation based in Alexandria, Virginia, filed suit inClarkandWashoecounties, seeking to force county election officials to investigate allegations that some voters had listed commercial addresses as their residential addresses. In both cases, the plaintiff is Fred Kraus, a former Venetian executive who was a plaintiff in former President Donald Trump campaign’sfailed effortin 2020 to amend Clark County’s mail ballot counting system. Including a commercial address in a voter’s registration does not automatically indicate fraud, and the state has a process for investigating reports of registration fraud. See below for more information. What addresses are included on a voter’s registration? When registering to vote, a person must designate a residential address, which must be where they reside,Nevada law stipulates. These addresses are necessary to determine a person’s election precinct and, in turn, their Congressional and legislative districts. This residential address cannot be a business address or P.O. Box. If a person’s residence is not a street address, then a description of their residence’s location must be provided alongside their registration. For example, people who are unhoused can list the four street corners where they typically are located. People also do not lose their Nevada residence if they are in the military, a student or are incarcerated. Voters may also include another address as their mailing address, which is where mail ballots would be sent. This address can be a P.O Box, business location or out-of-state address, such as a person’s college residence. Can voters live at a business address? Yes. There are situations in which a person may live at a commercial address, such as a homeless shelter, their own personal business or a religious convent. What is the process for investigating fraud related to voter addresses? Nevada lawoutlines a process for investigating fraud related to voter registration, which can besubmittedto the secretary of state’s office. After receiving a report of a fraudulent voter registration, a county clerk will meet with the district attorney, who will make a determination if there is probable cause to believe a voter’s identity or residence may be fraudulent. If probable cause is established, the county clerk will mail a notice — with a return receipt requested — to the voter that outlines the grounds for canceling the registration. If the county clerk does not receive sufficient proof of a person's identity and residence within 15 days after receiving the return receipt, the voter’s registration will be canceled. However, if there is not enough time to follow that process before an election, the county clerk will issue “an affidavit of cancellation” that is attached to the voter’s identity in a voting roster. If the voter attempts to vote, they will only be allowed to do so if they provide photo identification and sufficient proof of residency at their listed residential address. In addition, if there is probable cause to believe a person’s residence may be fraudulent, and the person attempts to vote by mail, the person’s ballot must be kept separate from other ballots. It will not be counted unless the voter provides sufficient proof of residence and identity to the county clerk before mail ballots are counted on Election Day. An official with the secretary of state’s office said the vast majority of election fraud complaints are found to be unsubstantiated.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rfk-jr-s-campaign-says-it-has-enough-signatures-to-get-on-nv-ballot-validation-pending,True,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s independent presidential campaign said Wednesday it gathered enough signatures for its petition to place him on the November general election ballot in Nevada, and county election officials will now undertake a signature verification process. The campaign submitted more than 20,000 signatures to Clark County election officials Wednesday and plans to submit about 8,000 signatures in Washoe County on Friday, said Randell Hynes, the Kennedy campaign’s coordinator for the state. The campaign also plans to submit signatures in several rural counties Friday, which is the final day that presidential campaigns can submit signatures for ballot petitions. At least 10,095 signatures must be verified for the campaign to qualify for the general election ballot. County officials have four days — not including holidays and weekends — to verify the number of valid signatures and submit the count to state election officials. The signature submission is the latest development in a ballot access campaign that has featured lawsuits, invalid petitions, misspellings on official documents and allegations of political interference. Even if enough signatures are approved, the Nevada Democratic Party hassuedto keep Kennedy off the ballot, alleging his affiliation with other political parties violates state requirements for independent candidates. Kennedy initially entered the presidential race as a Democrat last year before deciding to run as an independent. The Democrats’ lawsuit comes amid fears that Kennedy’s inclusion on the Nevada ballot could prove costly for President Joe Biden. Polls show former President Donald Trump leading Biden in Nevada by an average of about4 percentwhen no third-party candidates are included, but by5 percentwhen third-party candidates are counted. Kennedy consistently receives about 10 percent of the Nevada vote when matched against Biden and Trump, according to polls. Kennedy is an environmental lawyer and nephew of John F. Kennedy. He rose to prominence during the pandemic because of his anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. This is the second time the Kennedy campaign has submitted signatures to qualify for Nevada’s ballot. In March, his campaignsaidit had collected more than 15,000 signatures, but that petition wasdeemed invalidbecause the petition did not list a running mate, as is required under state law. Kennedy’s campaignsuedthe state last month over its ballot petition rules, but that lawsuit will be rendered moot if enough of the signatures submitted this week are approved because this is an amended petition that includes his running mate, attorney Nicole Shanahan. Amid the uncertainty surrounding the initial ballot petition, the Kennedy campaign filed anew petitionwith a running mate included in early June, with about one month left to gather enough signatures. The next week, however, the campaignfiled a new petitionafter discovering the previous one had misspelled “United States” twice. There are no state statutes that indicate such a mistake could have prevented ballot access. The third petition was the one circulated for signatures in the past month. Kennedy has said“there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective”— a comment he hassince tried to walk back— thatvaccines cause autismand that the coronavirus might have been“ethnically targeted”to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people. The World Health Organizationreportsthat vaccines “are very safe” and prevent adverse effects from harmful diseases. Earlier this week, aVanity Fair articlerevealed for the first time sexual assault allegations against him brought by a former family babysitter. Kennedydeclinedto comment on the allegations but acknowledged he is not a “church boy” and said there are “so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.” Heheld a rallyin Las Vegas in February, during which he echoed a common campaign pledge to tell the National Institutes of Health to take a “break” on drug production and efforts to curtail infectious diseases. His other policy positions are relatively mainstream Democratic ideas, including a federal $15 minimum wage, transitioning to cleaner energy sources and police reform.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/washoe-county-primary-election-results-remain-unchanged-after-recount,True,"June primary election results did not change after a controversial three-day recount in Washoe County, paid for by far-right provocateur Robert Beadles on behalf of three candidates. In the contested elections for County Commission District 4 and School Board Trustee District G,  preliminary results show Clara Andriola and Perry Rosenstein still won. Andriola carried 43.34 percent of the vote in the commission race, and Perry Rosenstein had 34.64 percent of the votes in the school board election — roughly the same percentages as before the recount. A third recount of Reno City Council’s Ward 1 election by candidate Lily Baran was not completed because Baran withdrew her recount request. Baran later changed her mind, but officials with the City of Reno said once awithdrawal occurs, it’s final. Though the Washoe County preliminary recount results indicate the primary outcome did not change, four candidates saw minimal shifts in their vote totals. Republican Mark Lawson, who had called for the recount in the County Commission District 4 election, lost one vote, while his competitor Andriola saw no changes. In the school board district recount, Paul White, who had requested the recount, gained one vote along with his competitor Diane Nicolet. Rosenstein lost five votes. Andriola, Rosenstein and Nicolet will advance to the general election in their respective races. Washoe County commissioners will canvass the recount votes at its already scheduled meeting on July 9. The canvass is the official tally of votes for any given election. The purpose of the canvass is to account for every ballot cast and ensure that every valid vote cast is included in the election totals. Ahead of the recount,Baran,LawsonandWhitefiled lawsuits with the Nevada Supreme Court seeking hand recounts andtemporary restraining ordersto prohibit certain Washoe County officials who had overseen the June primary from conducting the recount. Beadles funded the three lawsuits and paid the candidates’ attorney fees. On his blog, Beadlescomplainedthat the Washoe County registrar of voters would not conduct the hand recount he had requested. “Why won’t they do what they are paid to do and required by law to do, a hand recount,” he posted. However, underNevada law, a recount must be conducted in the same manner as the original vote tabulation. Any losing candidate can seek a recount, but state law requires them to front the cost and receive a refund only if the recount changes the outcome in their favor. Recounts can be requested within three working days of the county or statewide canvass and must start within five days of receiving the demand. A recount must be completed within five days once it has commenced. Beadles paid about $50,000 per recount, totaling more than $150,000 for all three recounts. Though the law specifies that candidates need to file and pay for a recount, legal experts posted on the social media siteXthat Beadles paying for candidates could be counted as anin-kind contributionor a nonmonetary contribution, such as goods or services that are offered for free or for less than the usual charge. Those experts also noted that $50,000 is well above the $5,000 legal limit permitted for campaign contributions. In aninterview withThe Nevada Independent,Baran said she asked to revoke the recount request because she was worried about possible legal consequences of having Beadles pay for the recount. After her attorney assured her that would not be the case, she said she changed her mind. But officials with the City of Reno said it was too late, and the recount ended. Because Baran’s recount was stopped midway through, the county will likely deduct the amount spent on the partial recount from the $50,000 Beadles prepaid and refund the rest, county officials said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/will-trumps-las-vegas-idea-to-end-taxation-on-tips-catch-on,True,"When former President Donald Trump held a rally in Las Vegas in mid-June, hepledgedto end federal taxation of tips. “Hotel workers and people that get tips, you’re going to be very happy because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips,” he said. “We’re going to do that right away, first thing in office.” Such a policy would require an act of Congress. But the idea and the venue where he proposed it had strategic merit. A critical swing state, Nevada is home to more than 350,000 workers in the hospitality industry, including waiters, bartenders and cocktail servers. The union that represents hospitality workers, the mighty Democrat-aligned Culinary Workers Union Local 226,immediately pannedthe proposal. “This is what we call a wild-ass campaign promise,” Culinary Union secretary-treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in an interview. “Trump is really pulling it out of you know where.” Although attracting the support of union leadership was always a near impossibility, the Trump campaign is hoping rank-and-file workers hear the message. His surrogates, including Rep.Marjorie Taylor Greene(R-GA) and Nevada GOP chairmanMichael McDonald, have posted photos of recent receipts, writing “Vote Trump — no tax on tips.” The seriousness of the proposal is yet to be determined — Trump, of course, rewrote much of the tax code through his signature 2017Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which did not include tax relief for tipped workers. With those tax cuts expiring next year, 2025 would serve as an opportunity for Congress to work on such a proposal. Rep. Richie Neal (D-MA), the top Democrat on the powerful Ways & Means Committee, which writes taxes, said raising the minimum wage would be the most efficient way to help workers — and that he suspected Trump’s proposal was motivated by politics rather than seriousness about tax policy. “Sounds to me like it’s a Nevada issue for him,” Neal said. “I think it’s the Electoral College that’s at work here.” Congressional Republicans across the ideological spectrum have championed Trump’s trial balloon. In the House, far-right Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and Thomas Massie (R-KY)introduceda bill to end federal income and employment taxes on tips. Meanwhile in the Senate, Sens. Steve Daines (R-MT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX)introducedsimilar legislation, with Daines, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, heralding the idea as a “stroke of genius” to appeal to working-class voters. And though Democrats have written off Trump as a serious policymaker — and are quick to remind voters the Trump tax cuts lowered rates onbillionairesandcorporations— some have expressed openness to the idea. “Are taxes going away on tips?” Pappageorge said. “That'll never happen. But is it a starting point to get some pressure and maybe some sort of relief for tip earners. We would support that.” Inside the policy Without any policy to offset the loss of revenue, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budgetestimatesthe policy could blow a $150 billion to $250 billion hole in the federal deficit over 10 years. That alone causes some lawmakers hesitation. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) said it’s a “great idea,” but he would need more clarity on whether it would be structured as an outright tax cut or include an offsetting revenue raiser. “I like it,” Amodei said. “We just have to make sure that when it comes to [the deficit], what do you do for that revenue?” Although tipped workers have fought for fair wages, experts cautioned that ending taxation on tips might not be as beneficial to workers as it seems upon first glance. Currently, workers pay federal income and payroll tax on tips. But many tipped wage earners do not earn enough to meet the threshold for owing federal income tax. The Bureau of Labor Statisticsreportsthat 50 percent of waiters earn less than $32,000 annually — exempting the vast majority from owing federal income tax. Jeff Waddoups, a labor economist at UNLV, projected that only the highest-earning hospitality workers — such as waiters at high-end restaurants — would receive tax relief. “Why advantage the workers who are more highly paid already?” Waddoups said. “What about all those workers who are in the same industry, working in the same firms, but don't make tips, or don't get paid by tips?” Waddoups also said that if implemented, the policy could indirectly depress wages. Nevada is one of just seven states thatrequiresemployers to pay their tipped workers the full minimum wage — $12 per hour — rather than a subminimum wage that workers theoretically make up via tips. If the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were to stop taxing tips, Nevada employers could not set a lower subminimum wage, as employers would be able to do in other states, figuring employees could make up the difference through lack of taxation. But companies could withhold or diminish pay raises. In the hospitality industry, labor costs are paid by a combination of the employers, via salary, and the consumers, via tips. It’s a delicate balance — as digital tipping replaced cash in most cases post-pandemic, consumers have reportedincreasing frustrationwith the frequency and amount they are expected to tip. If tips go untaxed while salary is taxed, companies could be incentivized against raising pay, Waddoups said. “Firms use their pay to attract workers,” he said. “If they have a situation where suddenly this group of workers’ tax is lowered, and take-home pay increases, it might just give them an incentive to fight harder against pay raises — ‘they’re not having to pay as much in taxes, so we just won’t raise their hourly rate as much as inflation.’” An analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center came to the same conclusion — companies would be incentivized to game the tax system and consumers could decrease their tip amount. “If the consumer knows the tips are not taxed, do they lower the tip?” UNLV economist Stephen Miller asked. Additionally, the Tax Policy Center cautioned that ending taxes on tips could serve to undercut other efforts to improve hospitality workers’ standard of living, including the movement to raise the federal minimum wage. Waddoups agreed, saying the simplest way to increase tipped workers’ income would be to raise the minimum wage, rather than decrease their tax burden. Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) said in an interview that she supported the policy but did not trust Trump to follow through. When asked if she was worried about companies suppressing wages, Lee followed up with a statement saying “ending taxes on tips should not be used as an excuse for employers to cut wages.” Inside the politics Republicans are hoping Trump’s trial balloon can make a difference in states such as Nevada, where tipped workers are a critical voting bloc. U.S. Senate candidate Sam Brown has embraced ending taxes on tipped workers,telling NBC Newsin June that he had planned to roll out a similar policy and that the former president “scooped” him. Trumpclaimedhe got the idea from a waiter in Las Vegas, reportedly asking her what it would take to win her vote. In 2020, President Joe Bidenwonthe vote from workers whose income was lower than $50,000 by a 16-point margin in Nevada — a deficit Trump will need to cut into to win the state this time around. On the Hill, Republicans think the policy represents a strong appeal. “Workers heavily support it,” said Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL), who sits on the Ways & Means Committee. “So I think it’s a great idea.” Most tipped workers in Southern Nevada — whom Trump is hoping the policy appeals to — are represented by a union. The Culinary Union, 60,000 members strong, has delivered the swing state to Democrats in past elections through powerful canvassing efforts and voting might. That number was even stronger among union households, whom Biden won by 19 percentage points. Democrats — and Culinary itself — believe the traditional alliance between the party and organized labor, in addition to Trump’s well-established record on taxes, can blunt any appeal the policy might have. “Folks need relief,” Pappageorge said. “They need fairness. But they're not stupid.” And it’s not as if the left has no ideas for workers — House Democrats havepassedbills to gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour andprotectworkers’ rights to organize by beefing up union protections, and haveproposedending the subminimum wage. “Donald Trump only cares about himself,” Rep. Steven Horsford said. “Hesaid that— ‘I don’t care about you, I only care about your vote.’ And people can donate billions of dollars to [Trump’s] campaign and to the House Republicans because they just want to focus on tax breaks for the wealthy and not the average person.” Horsford does favor tax relief for tipped workers through readjusting thetip allocation rateformula, which increased by more than 50 percent between 2020 and 2022. Pappageorge said he hopes the proposal — regardless of the messenger — can lead to discussions onadjustingthe tip allocation rate, which Culinary protested when the IRS raised it in 2022 and worked with Democrats including Horsford to negotiate with the agency. He said the union’s top priority for upcoming tax negotiations is ensuring they have a seat at the table to fix logistical IRS issues, including those related to the tip allocation rate. Similarly, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) said in a statement that she supports cutting tipped workers’ taxes and pointed out other opportunities, including expanding theEarned Income Tax CreditandChild Tax Credit. Like Horsford, she said Trump “will say anything to get elected” and is untrustworthy. Pappageorge said he believes Trump is throwing ideas at the wall and is unserious. He‘s also worried the former president was giving credence to the stereotype that tip earners are tax cheats. But he said he wants tax relief for tip earners to get more attention. “We’re willing to jump in the water with Trump,” he said. “This is a kitchen table issue for tip earners — the idea of fairness.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/aoc-stumped-for-biden-in-las-vegas-will-nevada-progressive-voters-follow-suit,True,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) hasn’t shied away from voicing her opposition to some of President Joe Biden’s policies. The 34-year-old congresswoman, who is perhaps the most prominent progressive in American politics, has been particularly critical about Biden’s continued support of Israel amid its monthslong war against Hamas that has left more than 37,000 Palestinians dead, according to Palestinian health authorities. But Ocasio-Cortez struck a different tone in Las Vegas in June, a week before last week’s presidential debate. In her first appearance as a surrogate for Biden’s re-election campaign, Ocasio-Cortez held three events in Southern Nevada focusing on affordable housing and reproductive rights, delivering a forceful endorsement of Biden. “We will have the right to choose, not just with our bodies, but at the ballot box too,” she said at a rally for reproductive rights. “And the only way that Republicans get this message is when the people in this country decisively elect majorities in Congress, re-elect [Sen.] Jacky Rosen and, again, re-elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.” But the question remains: Will progressives in the Silver State be swayed? Most progressive groups are backing Biden’s re-election bid — though not with explicit endorsements — while some further-left groups are not, such as one group fighting for Palestininans. Despite lacking full support from progressives, Democrats are banking on young voters determining their future is better served by Biden’s policies, a strategy that could face challenges, particularly from less engaged voters. “The young voters I talk to, it's not necessarily a choice between two men, but the future that they want to have,” said Laura Martin, the executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada (PLAN). “It's going to take some work to get people to get their ballots in and also vote the full length of the ballot.” Polling shows Biden has ground to make up with young Nevadans (who typically lean more progressive), a voting bloc that overwhelmingly supported him four years ago, according toexit polls, in a state where he won by around 33,000 votes. Apollreleased last month from Emerson College found less than 30 percent of Nevadans aged 18-29 approved of Biden’s presidency, the lowest rate of any age group. Forty-eight percent of the surveyed young voters said they would support Biden in a hypothetical matchup against Trump, with 20 percent undecided. An early June Fox Newspollof Nevadans found Biden with an 8-point lead among voters younger than 35 in a head-to-head against Trump, which fell to a 5-point lead when third party candidates were included. Progressives have seen successes and failures in the state in recent years. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) cruisedto victoryin the state’s presidential caucus in 2020, defeating Biden by more than 20,000 votes. Months later, Democratic socialists took over the state party butlost controlin a seismic defeat in 2023, even losing the support of the Las Vegas Democratic Socialists of America (LVDSA). Amy Pason, a UNR professor who researchers political rhetoric and communication, described the progressive wing of the party as “in a state of flux.” “I think there's still a space for progressives and Democrats to sort of figure out their politics in Nevada,” Pason said. Jiromi Pena, a UNLV student and a youth immigration justice fellow at Make the Road Nevada (which focuses on helping Hispanic and immigrant communities), said many young people she speaks with are unsure if they are going to vote in the election, and it can be difficult to persuade voters. Still she remains optimistic people will vote based on the potential of a second Trump administration. “A lot of people will just cut you off and just don't want to hear it … and they tend to ignore, just everything else that Biden is mostly trying to do and focus on the few negative aspects,” she said. “I feel like if people open their eyes and just see all the information, how much support that [Trump] has, they'll be more inclined to show up.” Progressive groups Some left-leaning groups aren’t gung ho about Biden. Nevadans for Palestinian Liberation has been staunchly opposed to Biden, while the Democratic Socialists  often have eschewed moderate Democrats like him. Neither group responded to a request for an interview. Meanwhile, some of the most prominent progressive groups — PLAN, Make the Road Nevada and Battle Born Progress — generally have been supportive of Biden and have emphasized the differences between Biden and former President Donald Trump, adopting a similar strategy as the Biden campaign, rather than focusing on Biden the person. Jeremy Gelman, a UNR political science professor, said this isn’t an easy sell. It is often harder to persuade less engaged voters to vote based on policy rather than their personal view of a candidate, he added. “For them, thinking through, how does policy get made, what powers does the president have, what does the federal bureaucracy actually do — all of that sort of stuff is a harder cognitive sell than just saying this guy has your best interests out for you,” Gelman said. The groups also have been willing to voice their opposition. When Biden issued an executive order last month that permitted removing migrants without processing asylum claims after a daily crossing threshold was met, PLANcalled the move“short-sighted and cruel,” and Battle Born said it “misses the mark.” “We have to be able to speak up when things aren't right, but we also have to recognize that the Biden administration has done a lot of good for the people of Nevada,” said Shelbie Swartz, the executive director of Battle Born Progress. “Conversely, Trump and allies have this really dystopian, horrific future that they are hoping to enact if he makes it to the White House.” Martin, the PLAN executive director, said the group is not beholden to the Democratic Party and does not endorse presidential candidates, but added that its work centers on listening to voters and informing them of what a second Trump or Biden term might look like. She said she speaks with young people who worry about ever being able to afford a house (economy is consistently the top issue among most voters) and having to help pay their parents’ bills, but they also are aware of the dangers another Trump presidency could pose. That is also the strategy for Make the Road, Pena said. “Even though we acknowledge that our members aren't happy with the mandate of the Biden administration and that the disappointment is real, we try to not give into that narrative,” she said. “We try to constantly remind our communities of the reality that we lived under Trump.” Swartz from Battle Born Progress said she expects more young people to eventually get on board with Biden. “I, myself, don't want to take young voters for granted and be like, ‘No, of course, they're going to show up for Biden,” she said. “I do think that there will be maybe a come to Jesus where folks compare and contrast the good that Biden has done in the White House versus the awful policy that Trump put into place.” AOC’s visit Although progressive groups lean in on the policy differences between Biden and Trump, Ocasio-Cortez’s visit was likely intended to fill a void left by Biden: connecting with voters on a more human level, said Pason, the UNR communications professor. She led an hourlong discussion with women who shared their stories receiving reproductive care, including one who had to terminate her pregnancy after her water broke when she was 20 weeks pregnant. Ocasio-Cortez also shared her story. Her father died while she was in college, leaving just her and her mother, who cleaned houses. Around that time, she was sexually assaulted and didn’t tell anyone for a decade. “I was terrified and completely, utterly, absolutely alone,” she said. Earlier in the day, Ocasio-Cortez met with a North Las Vegas renter, Graciela Rodriguez, who said in an interview that her rent has increased by 40 percent since moving into her home more than 15 years ago. She used to travel the country and has been to 36 states but hasn’t traveled in more than a year because of rising prices. Ocasio-Cortez shared her own story of her parents buying a small home in New York that became unaffordable when her dad died. “Now with the way things are today, there’s no buying the home that my parents were able to afford,” she said. Pason said this was likely an intentional way to shore up some of the lack of enthusiasm surrounding Biden as a candidate. Gelman from UNR agreed, but he added one visit won’t make any difference. “Sustained outreach by AOC and legislators of her ilk — young legislators, progressives, that sort of thing — can make a difference,” Gelman said. “The Biden campaign is going to try and crack the nut of who has credibility with young Nevada voters and put them in front of young Nevada voters.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/advocate-baran-among-recounts-for-northern-nevada-candidates-funded-by-far-right-activist,True,"With only 15 votes separating her from the victor in a Reno City Council race, Lily Baran filed for a recount on Tuesday. The progressive activist had finished second behind Frank Perez, the former chair of the Washoe County Library board, in the Ward 1 race. The winner of the primary will face incumbent Kathleen Taylor. On Wednesday,KRNV's Ben Margiottbroke the newsthat the recount was paid for by an unlikely benefactor — far-right activist Robert Beadles. The $50,560 payment from the prominent Republican donor who has quoted racist and antisemitic materials dismayed some of Baran’s supporters and raised questions about whether it constituted an illegal campaign contribution. Baran said Candy Green, a local political consultant for officials such as Washoe Commissioner Mike Clark, reached out to her with Beadles’ offer, which Baran accepted. A source close to the issue shared that Baran had posted ona private Instagram story on June 21asking for people’s opinions on whether she should accept the money or not. Beadles also wrote recount checks for Washoe County Commission District 4 hopeful Mark Lawson, who lost by 18.4 percentage points against Clara Andriola in the Republican primary, and Paul White, who was hoping to run against Perry Rosenstein for the Washoe County School Board District G trustee but came up almost 6 percentage points short. The three recounts Beadles paid for total more than $150,000. Baran said the closeness of the vote — which put her0.43 percentage points behind Perez— made it a “very reasonable” decision to seek a recount and the $50,560 cost forced her to accept Beadles’ offer after she had only been able to raise $350. “This does not, by any means, mean that I am consigned to his hateful agenda or conspiracy theories or anything like that,” Baran said, adding she was not questioning the integrity of the election. Beadles is a prominent Republican donor who has quoted a controversial piece by conservative Black columnist Walter Williams who said there is little evidence showing slavery and racial discrimination’s legacy had negative effects on Black communities. He has also quoted theProtocols of Zion, a piece of long-debunked antisemitic propaganda stating that Jews are plotting to take over the world, and funded mailers depicting Reno City Councilman Devon Reese, who is part of the LGBTQ+ community, as a drag queen. “In addition to this I would like to see all ballots counted as not all votes [mail ballots] were cured and many people have told me they were marked late when they were sent on time which is concerning,” Baran wrote on the Instagram post. “Nothing wrong with due diligence.” Baran said Beadles was paying a bill to the city and it was not a campaign contribution, which would exceed the $5,000 limit. She also said she had contacted lawyers who said the payment was legal. According to state law, a candidate needs to file and pay for a recount. Thoughlegal experts stated on Xit could be counted as an in-kind contribution, $50,000 is still well above the legal limit permitted for campaign contributions. “I have done everything above the board this entire time. I wouldn't stop now,” Baran said. However others, including former Reno Councilman Paul McKenzie, claim the $150,000 is an in-kind contribution and illegal. McKenzie sent a letter to the Nevada Secretary of State Office on Friday morning asking for an investigation into the matter and for “enforcement actions” against Baran, Lawson and White for accepting “illegal contributions.” Additionally, he called for action against Beadles, “who appears now to be a serial violator of the law regarding elections.” Baran,LawsonandWhitefiledlawsuitswith the Nevada Supreme Court for hand recounts andrestraining orderswith the goal of prohibiting Washoe County officials from being those conducting the recount. Beadles is funding all of these. “You have to, because [otherwise] then they just do a machine count,” Baran said. “I would like them to look into the ballots at the Cares Campus. I would like to look at the ballots that were said to be returning late, but they weren't late.” The Washoe County Registrar of Voters office said it is “commencing the recount in the way established by” state law. Beadles seemed to indicate he believed darker motives were involved. “This is not a Republican, Democrat, or Non-Partisan issue; this is an issue for all. That’s why they continue to try to divide us with their libel and slander of anyone who dares question their mile-long list of issues,”Beadles wrote on his blog,Operation Sunlight. The Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter said while the group still supports Baran, it does not condone her decision to accept funds from Beadles. “In many other states, losing by 15 votes would be sufficient to trigger an automatic recount, paid for by the county. … We support Lily’s decision to ensure all voters in Ward 1 had their voices properly represented, but the Toiyabe Chapter unequivocally denounces everything Robert Beadles stands for — baseless election fraud claims, racism, antisemitism, and conspiracy theories,” the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter said in a statement released Thursday afternoon. According toKRNVthe recount is scheduled for Sunday.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/constitutional-amendment-on-abortion-rights-qualifies-for-november-ballot,True,"The effort to enshrine abortions rights in the Nevada Constitution has qualified for the November ballot after gathering enough signatures, the secretary of state’s office announced Friday. County election officials verified more than 127,000 signatures gathered by Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, well more than the roughly 102,000 needed to qualify for the ballot. The groupsaid in Maythat it had submitted more than 200,000 signatures for verification. The approval marks a victory for Democrats who have pushed for months to land the question on the general election ballot to shore up abortion rights in the Silver State and drive more Democrats to the polls in November. “Today, we are thrilled that Nevadans will be able to make their voices heard and stand up for the right to make their own healthcare decisions in the face of government interference,” Lindsey Harmon, the president of Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, said in a statement. Abortion is already legal up through 24 weeks into a pregnancy in Nevadabecause of a 1990 referendumthat can only be overturned by a majority vote of the people. Democrats said enshrining abortion rights in the state Constitution is necessary after the fall ofRoe v. Wadetwo years ago led to abortion bans being enacted nationwide. Because the petition is an effort to amend the state Constitution, it must be approved by voters twice, so it would head to the 2026 ballot if a majority of voters approve the measure in November. Republicans have said the ballot question is misleading because abortion is already legal in the state. An effort to block the petition is pending before the Nevada Supreme Court, but its success is an extreme long shot. The effort failed in district court, and the state Supreme Court alreadyapproveda broader reproductive rights ballot petition earlier this year that had faced steeper legal hurdles. The petition approved Friday would protect the right to an abortion until fetal viability, generally considered about 23 or 24 weeks, or when necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient. These are essentially the same protections that already exist in Nevada, but a constitutional right to an abortion would be harder to overturn. State law required petition supporters to gather at least 102,362 signatures by June 26, with a minimum of 25,591 signatures coming from each of the state’s four congressional districts. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office announced Friday that county election officials had verified at least 29,000 signatures in each congressional district. Democrats hope the measure will increase voter turnout and enthusiasm in a swing state where both presidential candidates are unpopular. Similar abortion ballot measures have had success sinceRoewas overturned, including inOhioandKentucky. An Emerson Collegepollfrom earlier this month found 58 percent of Nevadans supported the measure, with only 20 percent opposing and the rest undecided. The Nevada ballot initiative has garnered national attention. A nonprofit affiliated with Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat who is likely a future presidential candidate,donated $1 millionto petition efforts last year. The legal challenge of the petition comes from a new PAC called the Coalition for Parents and Children. The lawsuit argued that the petition’s “description of effect” — a 200-word summary included on signature gathering forms — was misleading by not acknowledging that abortion is already legal under Nevada law. It also said the petition would create an unfunded mandate. Carson City District Court Judge James Russell ruled the “description of effect” was “legally adequate” and there was no evidence the petition would result in an unfunded mandate. An appeal is pending before the state Supreme Court and an opening brief is due next week. The Legislature also passed its ownconstitutional amendmentlast year to guarantee “a fundamental right to reproductive freedom.” The measure must be approved again in the 2025 legislative session to qualify for the 2026 general election ballot.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/new-groups-aim-to-restore-faith-in-election-system-uphold-democracy,True,"Two former Nevada governors and other top elected leaders have joined separate efforts to restore confidence in Nevada’s election system. Former Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, and former Speaker of the Nevada Assembly Richard Perkins (D-Henderson) will serve on the bipartisan Nevada board of the Democracy Defense Project (DDP), a new nonprofit launched Tuesday that is focusing on eight battleground states: Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan. Meanwhile, former Republican Gov. Robert List and state Sen. Heidi Seevers Gansert (R-Reno) are co-leading RightCount Nevada, another new nonprofit engaged in battleground states that seeks to restore confidence in elections. Sandoval — a popular two-term governor who has largely stayed out of the political fray since becoming UNR’s president in 2020 — said that representatives on the Democracy Defense Project’s board include people who have served in positions at every level of government from both parties, and all share a “commitment to democracy and free and fair elections.” “This is truly an effort, regardless of the candidate that an individual supports, that they can feel good about their vote and after the outcome of the election feel good about that as well,” Sandoval said in an interview withThe Nevada Independent. The efforts aim to address agradual loss of faith in the country’s electoral systemduring the last two decades and the perception of a “stolen” election in 2020 despite President Joe Biden’s victory over former President Donald Trump andno evidence of widespread voter fraud. As Trump and Biden gear up for a rematch, leaders of the two organizations say that it’s essential that voters understand that Nevada’s election system is safe and secure before they exercise their right to cast a ballot. RightCount launched last week in Nevada alongside chapters in three other battleground states: Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. In an interview withThe Nevada Independent, List said the recently formed national organization approached him to bring a chapter to Nevada, which he thinks is necessary given that “there’s been a serious erosion in trust and confidence of the election process.” “Our message is simply: You need to vote to participate,” List said. “Our democracy depends upon it, and you as an individual have a responsibility to take part in that democracy, and you can trust that your vote will be counted.” Sandoval said he was not aware of any effort to collaborate between the two groups but expects them to be “working in parallel for the same objective.” He added that the more organizations working on building trust and confidence in the electoral process, the better. On itswebsite, RightCount Nevada describes itself as an “educational organization” focused on affirming the security and integrity of elections, sharing information about policy changes and building trust among voters. Representatives of RightCount at the national level said in a statement that the nonprofit was founded in response to increasing threats against election officials and growing numbers of Republican and independent voters who express little to no confidence in the election system. Little information is available about the organization’s finances because the IRS granted it a501(c)3 nonprofit statusin late May, meaning it does not have to disclose its donors. RightCount representatives declined to identify any of their funding sources toThe Nevada Independentbut wrote in the statement that it had received donations from a “mix of nonprofits and individuals that align with our mission to help fortify and protect the rule of law in the tabulation of voting.” Similar to RightCount, the Democracy Defense Project is a newly launched 501(c)4 nonprofit, which means that there are not many details available on the organization’s finances. However, a spokesperson noted that the organization is financially supported by Democratic and Republican donors. Sandoval said his understanding is that backers of the Democracy Defense Project all share the same goal of having fair elections and trust in the electoral process. He disagreed with a question about whether he worries about the lack of transparency surrounding the project’s backers or whether this involves so-called “dark money,” or political spending meant to influence a voter's decision, where the money’s source is unknown. “That’s not a phrase I would use in this context,” he said. “The singular objective, and that’s why I agreed to be a part of this, is to have trust in elections and to avoid what happened in 2020.” Polling conducted on behalf of RightCount Nevada this year found that 38 percent of Republican voters and 32 percent of independent voters have little or no confidence that the 2024 elections in Nevada will be accurate in terms of ballot casting and counting. RightCount’s launch in Nevada was part of a coordinated rollout among the four states, with moderate and conservative Republicans in other states also publishingop-edsandvideoswithin a similar timeframe. RightCount Nevada’slaunch videofeatured various Republican voters, including an Army veteran, a retired firefighter and elected officials speaking about how Nevada’s election system is safe and secure. “It used to be, win or lose, we trust our elections,” Seevers Gansert, who led Senate Republicans in 2023 but isn’t running for re-election, said in the video. “RightCount’s trying to get us back to that place.” List said that RightCount Nevada is primarily focused on reaching out to Republican voters. He said he believes that some of the doubts and misinformation around the state’s election process surround Nevada’s recent adoption of a largely all-mail voting system before the 2020 election. “There have been all kinds of lawsuits flying around, and those raise questions and doubts on the part of people and, in the end, we know that the system still works,” List said. “While there are slip ups here and there, from time to time, in a handful of situations, they’re never big enough to actually influence the outcome of an election.” Seevers Gansert toldThe Nevada Independentthat voters have legitimate questions, and it’s important not to dismiss or ignore them. She said the group will work to illuminate and explain election processes, such as how mail ballots are safely stored, how election machines are not connected to the internet and how ballot tabulation takes place. Faith in elections has been shaken during the last four years by conspiracy theories such asthe “Big Lie,” an unfounded claim by Trump that the 2020 election was stolen, which has been linked tosignificant turnoverwithin theelection workforceandincreased harassment and violencetoward election workers. The false narratives have also resulted in efforts across the state and country to hand count paper ballots because of unfounded fears that voting machines can be hacked andare error-prone. In 2022, GOP nominees in Nevada running for U.S. Senate, attorney general and secretary of state andabout a third of candidates in state legislative primarieseither cast doubt on the electoral process or supported the “Big Lie.” Residents and elected officials in rural Nevada have also raised myriad claims of voter fraud opportunitiescreated by voting machines. List, a 10-year consultant for Dominion Voting Systems, a provider of election equipment that was often named in those conspiracy theories, vouched for the accuracy of the machines at meetings in Elko and Lincoln counties. More recently, Trump-aligned groups have challenged the state’s lawpermitting the acceptance of mail ballots up to four business days after polls close, so long as those ballots are postmarked by Election Day, and filed a lawsuit alleging that Nevada had insufficiently maintained its voter rolls (the case was dismissed), among other election process-related challenges. Perkins — who spent 14 years in the Legislature and now runs a lobbying firm — toldTheNevada Independenthe got involved in the Democracy Defense Project after they contacted him. He said the group shares his principles about the safety, security and transparency of elections. “I don't think that, at least in my lifetime, our republic has been under more of an attack. And a lot of that attack is founded in the attack on our electoral system,” Perkins said. “Our democracy is truly based upon electoral participation, and to the extent that those folks don't go out and vote, we're worse off for it.” Turnout in the June primary election was 19 percent. List posited that thehistorically low turnoutcould be attributed to the state’sautomatic voter registration system, which may have increased the number of registered voters but does not guarantee voter engagement, or to a lack of faith in the election system. The low turnout has also been attributed to the lack of competitive races in the primary at the top of the ticket, especially in Nevada’s U.S. Senate race, where Republican Sam Brown was considered the front-runner from day one, and Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) had no serious competitors. List said RightCount Nevada will work with county clerks and registrars of voters to identify where there are questions and help communicate answers to the public, and that proof of their success will be seen in turnout on Election Day in November and increased trust in the election system. Similarly, Perkins said he hopes the Democracy Defense Project will reinstill confidence in the election process regardless of party affiliation. “We're not leaning towards any group whatsoever,” Perkins said. “I don't care if you have an ‘R,’ a ‘D’ or any other indicator after your name. If you try to tear down our election system, we're going to point it out.” Editor’s note: This story appears in Indy Elections, The Nevada Independent’s newsletter dedicated to comprehensive coverage of the 2024 elections.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/aarp-poll-finds-trump-leading-biden-in-nevada-older-voters-more-motivated-to-turn-out,True,"A new poll of likely Nevada voters commissioned by the AARP finds former President Donald Trump with a 3-percentage-point lead over President Joe Biden. In a full ballot test including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other third-party candidates, Trump’s lead over Biden expands to 7 percentage points. And yet, like other polls this cycle, the AARP poll finds Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) leading Republican Sam Brown, suggesting a significant amount of ticket-splitting. Rosen, who holds a 5-percentage-point lead over Brown, significantly outperforms Biden with independents and young voters. In the generic ballot test for Congress, the poll found Republicans and Democrats tied at 46 percent each. The poll was conducted between June 12 and June 18 with 600 likely voters over 18, and has a margin of error of 4 percent. AARP also polled 800 voters over 50 and 400 Hispanic voters over 50. Two firms that collaborated on the poll — Republican-aligned Fabrizio Ward and Democrat-aligned Impact Research — interviewed respondents in both English and Spanish. Poll respondents were 37 percent registered Democrat, 35 percent registered Republican and 26 percent registered nonpartisan. Pollsters decided on that breakdown in an acknowledgment that despite being the largest group among registered voters, independents are less likely to vote. Pollsters said that identifying persuadable voters — such as the nearly quarter of voters over 50 who indicated they will split their ticket — and appealing to their issues will be key for the campaigns. “We know they're going to vote,” Democratic pollster Jeffrey Liszt said of older swing voters. “And there are enough of them to decide these races.” In the presidential race, women preferred Biden by 6 percentage points in a head-to-head contest, while Trump won men by 14 percentage points. The poll finds Biden winning voters under 34 and close to capturing voters over 65, but getting blown out among middle-aged voters. In the full ballot that includes third party candidates, Biden’s lead with young voters dwindles from 18 percentage points to just 6 points. Nearly 40 percent of voters under 34 selected a third-party candidate when given the opportunity. The poll finds Kennedy earning 10 percent of the vote, although his ballot access has not been secured. The independent candidate isfightingthe Nevada secretary of state in court over his access to the ballot; meanwhile, Nevada Democrats aresuingto keep him from the ballot over alleged violations of electoral law governing independent candidates. Both pollsters agreed that Biden’s weakness relative to Rosen and the generic Democrat indicate dissatisfaction with the president from voter blocs he and Democrats have been able to turn out in the past. “What you're seeing in the disparity between the presidential vote and the Senate vote isn't so much Rosen-Trump voters,” Republican pollster Bob Ward said in an interview. “It's more of an erosion of Biden voters on the Democratic side, and they're going to Robert Kennedy.” Biden’s approval rating remains significantly underwater — and worse in Nevada than it is nationally. The poll found that Biden’s approval rating is 37 percent, while 58 percent of voters disapprove  — a 21-point gap, compared with his national15-percentage-point underwater gap. Trump’s approval rating is also underwater, but only by 5 percentage points. Rosen gets much better marks. The poll found her with a 9 percent net approval rating. She is outpacing Biden by 18 percentage points with independents, 19 points with voters under 34 and even registered Republicans by 11 points. Ward said with the economy being a top focus for voters of all ages, it stands to reason that though Biden and Rosen are both incumbents, voters would blame the president more for their cost of living struggles. “Senators typically don't get tagged for a bad economy — [the] president does,” Ward said. “I think that is what you're seeing here.” With its focus on older voters, the poll found that Trump leads Biden by 12 percentage points among voters over 50 in the full ballot test, while Biden leads with Hispanics over 50 by 9 percentage points. But Trump’s strength with older voters did not trickle down to Brown — who had only a 5-percentage-point advantage with all voters over 50, and Rosen winning by 19 percentage points among older Hispanic voters. Ward said voters over 65 — whom Rosen is currently winning by a small margin — should be the Brown campaign’s top target. “I would absolutely be leaning into them on an economic message, but an economic message tailored to where that sweet spot is with those voters — which will include a strong defense of Social Security,” Ward said. The poll suggests that both Rosen and Brown have work to do to build up their name identification — and an opportunity to negatively define their opponent. While Rosen’s favorability rating was 6 percentage points above water to Brown’s 1 percent, 15 percent of voters had never heard of her while an additional 19 percent had no opinion of her. This phenomenon was even more pronounced for Brown — 23 percent of voters have not heard of him while 20 percent have no opinion. Additionally, the poll found that older voters are more motivated to turn out come the fall. Eighty-five percent of voters over 50 rated themselves a 10 out of 10 on a voting motivation scale, compared with 60 percent of voters 49 and under. Republicans were more motivated to vote than Democrats by 11 percentage points. That could spell trouble for Biden and Democrats. On issues, the AARP found that voters over 50 are most concerned about “immigration and border security” and “inflation and rising prices” — two issues that play into Republicans’ hands. But the poll suggested that Democrats might be able to make up ground by emphasizing Social Security and Medicare. Seventy-eight percent of voters over 50 said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who pledged to protect Social Security from cuts used to reduce the deficit, a typical Democratic campaign promise. And in the congressional ballot, 54 percent of all voters indicated that they would be less likely to support a candidate who would overturn the portion of the Inflation Reduction Act allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices for seniors — a law passed exclusively by Democrats. Because the poll found that older voters are more motivated to turn out, Liszt said Democratic campaigns should both be using a Social Security and family caregiving-based argument to persuade those voters while also working to turn out skeptical young voters who are interested in third-party candidates. “It's absolutely a challenge for Biden to fight the couch as well as fighting Trump,” Liszt said. “Part of the question is just whether or not those younger voters end up showing up.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-democrats-to-file-lawsuit-to-kick-rfk-jr-off-presidential-ballot-over-partisan-affiliations,True,"The Nevada Democratic Party is leading a legal effort to keep Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from appearing on Nevada’s presidential ballot, alleging in a lawsuit expected to be filed Thursday in state court that Kennedy’s affiliation with other political parties violates Nevada’s legal requirements for independent candidates. If successful, the case could be a model for removing Kennedy from the ballot in other states with similar laws. Nevada law stipulates that independent candidates for any partisan office must not be registered with a political party or proposing to run with a political party. The state’selectoral codedefines an independent candidate as someone nominated for partisan office but “who is registered with no political party affiliation.” State law governing how independent candidates can qualify for the ballot includes a requirement that “a person may not file as an independent candidate if he or she is proposing to run as the candidate of a political party.” The lawsuit against both the Kennedy campaign and the Nevada secretary of state will contend, sources say, that Kennedy’s campaign violates both of those laws. Kennedy is aregistered Democratin New York and has accepted various minor parties’ nominations in other states. He is running as the nominee of the third party he founded, the We the People Party, in Hawaii and North Carolina, on the American Independent Party ticket in California, for the Natural Law Party in Michigan and the Reform Party in Florida. The Nevada Democratic Party, in coordination with the Democratic National Committee, brought together two plaintiffs, registered Republican Uwe Rockenfeller and registered Democrat Francisco Morales, to file the lawsuit. The complaint will ask the court to instruct the secretary of state to bar Kennedy from the ballot. The quixotic scion of the famous Democratic political family, Kennedy is best known forpromotingfalseconspiracies about vaccines. But he could prove to be a potential spoiler in the 2024 race between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump — hispolling averagein Nevada exceeds that of the gap between Trump and Biden. In a statement, Nevada Democratic Party Executive Director Hilary Barrett said Kennedy’s partisan affiliations make him ineligible to appear on Nevada’s presidential ballot. “The State of Nevada has set up a reasonable process for placing candidates on the ballot,” Barrett said. “RFK Jr.’s campaign has not met the requirements necessary to run as an Independent non-affiliated party candidate in our state.” The Democrats’ lawsuit is not the Kennedy campaign’s first legal battle over ballot access in Nevada. Kennedy submitted his petition to appear on the Nevada ballot after announcing he had acquired the required signatures in early March. However, the Nevada secretary of state’s office later advised the campaign that the petition signatures were likely invalid, because the signatures were collected before Kennedy hadannouncedNicole Shanahan as his vice presidential nominee in late March —likely violatingNevada law stipulating that independent candidates’ petitions include a running mate. Kennedy’s campaign thenfiled a lawsuitagainst the Nevada secretary of state in early June, which is still pending in federal court.  In the meantime, he filed anew petitionand has been trying to collect signatures again before the July 5 deadline — which itself had to bere-filedin mid-June because the campaign misspelled “United States.” Kennedy’s ballot access strategy is different from that of Ross Perot, the 1992 independent candidate who won 19 percent of the vote. Perot did not accept the nomination of any party, appearing on the ballot in all 50 states as a nonpartisan independent candidate. Perot won 26 percent of the vote in Nevada. This story was updated at 1:15 p.m. on 6/20/24 to correct the list of states where Kennedy is running as the nominee of the We the People Party. Updated again at 2:13 p.m. to correct that the secretary of state's office did not reject Kennedy's petition.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-tosses-initial-gop-lawsuit-alleging-nevada-voter-rolls-insufficiently-maintained,True,"A federal judge on Tuesday approved a motion to dismiss a GOP-led lawsuit alleging that Nevada had insufficiently maintained its voter rolls, but will allow for an amended complaint addressing standing issues to be re-filed with the court. After a two hour hearing in Las Vegas, U.S. District Court Judge Cristina Silva ruled that the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Nevada GOP lacked standing to file the lawsuit. She also ruled that there was no way for the state to resolve the alleged issues when the lawsuit was filed, owing to federal guidelines on the timing of amending voting roll programs to remove ineligible voters. The groups have 14 days to amend their complaint. Claire Zunk, an RNC spokeswoman, said in a Wednesday statement the ruling was based on “flawed legal reasoning” and that the group “will pursue every legal avenue to fight this decision.” Attorneys representing the RNC and Nevada GOP did not respond to a request for comment sent Tuesday after the hearing. The ruling marks an initial legal defeat for Republican groups that have already launched a trio of election-related lawsuits in Nevada this year, including efforts to stop the counting ofmail ballotsafter Election Day, as allowed in state law,  and the alleged inclusion ofnon-postmarkedmail ballots. It is also the first ruling in the nation this year over the RNC’s efforts to challenge the legitimacy of states’ voting rolls — similar suits have been filed inArizona,CaliforniaandMichigan— as the national groupfloods courtsin swing states with lawsuits related to election administration. Former President Donald Trumprecently handpickedthe RNC’s new leadership team, including appointing his daughter-in-law Lara Trump as the group’s co-chair. The RNC and Nevada GOPfiled the suit in Marchalongside a Washoe County man named Scott Johnston, arguing that the number of registered voters in five counties were so high that the maintenance of the state’s voter rolls must have been insufficient. The Republicans asserted that three counties — Douglas, Lyon and Storey — have more registered voters on the rolls than adult citizens, and two jurisdictions — Carson City and Clark County — have voter registration rates that exceed 90 percent of the total adult population. The focus of the lawsuit is the state’s adherence to the National Voter Registration Act, a federal law that governs state policies on voter rolls. The law largely prohibits states from removing voters from its rolls until the voter has failed to respond to a notice and has not voted in the two general elections after the notice had been delivered — requirements that are also outlined inNevada law. Tuesday’s hearing largely revolved around whether the defendants in the case had standing and whether the state had an opportunity to resolve any allegations of impropriety. Silva ruled that the case failed to meet this threshold, citing federal law that prohibits any changes to voter roll programs to purge ineligible voters within 90 days of an election. The lawsuit was filed on March 18, less than 90 days before the June primaries, meaning there was no redress available for the state at the time. “Timing is everything in federal court,” Silva said. “I could not order the state to develop and implement a program at the time this action was brought.” The issue of standing also deals with whether the filers of the suit had suffered an injury. Silva was unconvinced by the arguments that the alleged voter roll violations had resulted in the Washoe County man included as a plaintiff suffering an injury, in that he distrusted the state’s elections. Silva also dismissed the standing arguments proffered by the Nevada GOP and RNC, which had contended that the alleged insufficient maintenance of the state voter rolls had harmed their mission because they rely on accurate voter rolls to conduct voter outreach to elect Republicans. She sided with the lawyers representing Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, who argued that these alleged harms were too general and speculative. Silva did not side against the GOP on all of the arguments, ruling that its notice of an impending lawsuit in December was sufficient even though the filed lawsuit addressed a wider array of issues. Hearings on motions to dismiss cases are not based on the strength of the evidence, so that went unaddressed on Tuesday. Even if Silva had denied the motion to dismiss the case, the state’s voter roll processes were all but guaranteed to be unaffected ahead of the November election. Federal cases take months to litigate, and the state is prohibited from changing its voter roll program 90 days before the election. Despite the ruling, there may be additional challenges this year related to voter registration, albeit on a smaller scale. Areportreleased Monday by Protect Democracy — a nonprofit focused on combating a rise in authoritarianism — identified 11 states, including Nevada, that could be targeted this year in campaigns brought by individuals to challenge states’ voter rolls. Laws related to voter registration challenges differ across states. InNevada, an individual can challenge another person’s right to vote, but is limited to challenging one person’s vote status at a time and must have personal knowledge of why that person is ineligible to vote.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/green-party-qualifies-for-2024-ballot-in-nevada-dem-lawsuit-pending,True,"The Green Party has qualified for the general election ballot in Nevada for the first time since 2008, though alawsuitbrought by Nevada Democrats to block the party’s access remains pending in Carson City District Court. Secretary of State Cisco Aguilartoldcounty election officials last week that the Green Party had submitted about 15,000 valid signatures, well more than the roughly 10,000 threshold needed for minor political parties to qualify for a general election ballot. The Green Party’s inclusion on the general election ballot adds another variable to the presidential race, because it could pull away dissatisfied left-leaning voters from supporting President Joe Biden. The party has not been on a Nevada general election ballot since 2008, when its presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney received around 1,400 votes, and in 2016, a federal judgedenied ballot accessto the party after it had not gathered enough valid signatures in time but asked to count signatures submitted after a deadline. In Nevada’s 2022 U.S. Senate race, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) won by fewer than 8,000 votes, while Biden won by around 34,000 in 2020. The Green Party hadsubmittednearly 30,000 signatures to gain ballot access, meaning around half of them were considered invalid. The Nevada Democratic Party’s lawsuit alleged that most of the signatures submitted were invalid (the party had conducted a limited review of signatures through a public records request) and asked a Carson City court to invalidate the signatures gathered and prohibit the secretary of state’s office from approving the Green Party’s petition. A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for later this month. Democrats argued that some petition signatures were gathered before the petition had been approved and should not be considered valid. In addition, some of the sworn affidavits on petition forms had been altered to change the county of the petition circulator, exhibit documents claim. The Green Party’s candidate for the presidential race this year is Jill Stein, who was also the party’s presidential nominee in 2012 and 2016. The presidential field is not complete yet in Nevada, as independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. must gather at least 10,095 signatures by July 5 before election officials undertake a signature verification process. This is Kennedy’s third petition to gain ballot access after its first wasinvalidatedfor not including a running mate (which is beingchallengedin court), and its second waspulledafter it misspelled “United States,” which was likely unnecessary because there are no Nevada statutes that indicate such a typo would invalidate a ballot petition.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/analysis-nevada-primary-turnout-down-but-mail-voting-again-reigns-supreme,True,"Turnout in last week’s state primaries dropped significantly from the 2020 and 2022 primaries, with fewer Nevadans participating across almost all counties. As of Friday morning, about 380,000 votes had been counted in the primary, a decrease of roughly 20 percent from the past two cycles. Despite the dropoff, voting by mail continued to dominate, as a greater share of Democrats and Republicans chose to vote by mail than two years ago, while the share of in-person voting decreased. Election analysts said the lack of competitive statewide primaries — especially on the Democratic side — likely dampened turnout. Although the turnout rate decreased this year, it still marks a significant increase in the raw number of participating voters compared with primaries held before 2020, the first election after the state launchedautomatic voter registrationand universal mail ballots. This year’s primary saw the third-highest number of votes cast since 1998 (the earliest year on record), trailing 2020 and 2022. However, the 19 percent overall turnout rate, which the state defines as the percentage of active registered voters who cast ballots, was the lowest since 2016. The introduction of automatic voter registration in 2020 led to a surge in registered voters, butmany of themare registered as nonpartisans, who cannot vote in primaries for partisan races. The Nevada Independentanalyzed primary turnout as of Friday morning, less than two days before all mail ballots must be received to be counted. Historically, little changes at this point in the process — in the 2022 election, about 3,000 mail ballots in Clark and Washoe counties were received on the final two days, according todatafrom the secretary of state’s office. Primary turnout is not predictive of general election trends because primary voters are much more engaged and informed than the general electorate, according to election analysts. In an interview, Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar suggested that the dropoff in participation rate may be because people were focused on the state’s presidential primary in February, which hadrecord turnoutfor a presidential nominating contest, and may not be choosing to engage in elections without the presidential race on the ballot. He also said that a lack of competitive statewide races — the only statewide race was theGOP primaryfor U.S. Senate, which Sam Brown won in a landslide — may have contributed to the decrease. The 2022 primary, by contrast, had several high-profile statewide primaries, including the GOP contests for governor, U.S. Senate and secretary of state. Aguilar added that his office prioritized other election-related issues, such as the rollout of a newtop-down voter databaseand recruitment of poll workers, over voter engagement. “When you talk about voter turnout and civic engagement, that falls on the candidates, and it falls on the major political parties to get their bases energized,” Aguilar said. Mail ballots continue rise in popularity Statewide, about 65 percent of voters cast ballots by mail, up from 57 percent two years ago. More than 74 percent of Democrats voted by mail, compared with roughly 68 percent two years ago. Notably, more than half of GOP primary voters cast mail ballots in 2024 after 43 percent did so in 2022. The increase in mail ballot use comes as Nevada Republicans have toned down their opposition to the voting method, which was the source ofconspiraciesrelated to the 2020 election. In the 2022 primary, Adam Laxalt, the GOP nominee for U.S. Senate,blasted the introduction of universal mail votingand falsely accused it of contributing to mass voter fraud. Jim Marchant, the Republican candidate for secretary of state, alsocalledfor the state to end mail voting. Marchant ran for Senate this year but finished a distant third. This year, GOP candidates were not nearly as antagonistic toward the voting method. Almost all Republicancandidates were mumon whether mail ballots led to fraud and some have changed their stance from two years ago. Take Mark Robertson, the GOP candidate for the 1st Congressional District, for example. While running in the same race in 2022, his campaign website called for a congressional inquiry into the potential risks of widespread mail voting. This year, though, he urged voters toembracemail voting to increase his chance of winning. Robertson received about 2,000 more votes in the primary than he did two years ago, though it’s unclear how many of these votes were cast by mail. David Damore, a political science professor at UNLV, said it is uncertain if this trend will continue into the general election because of the unpredictability of former President Donald Trump. “You didn't have anybody campaigning against it like you did in 2020, and ultimately convenience is going to weigh out on this,” Damore said. “The general election, you may have a candidate campaigning against mail ballots.” Trump has recentlyendorsedany legal voting method ahead of the general election, just four months afterinaccurately sayingmail ballots lead to “crooked elections.” The Trump campaign has also filed lawsuits in Nevada over the state’sallowanceof counting mail ballots after Election Day and alleged counting ofnon-postmarkedmail ballots. Jeremy Hughes, a Nevada Republican strategist, said he expects GOP hesitance about the method to fade. “As it becomes more common and voters get more comfortable with it, it's only going to increase,” Hughes said. Clark County Turnout was much lower in Clark County than two years ago. Around 234,000 Clark County voters participated in this year’s primary, a decrease of more than 50,000 from 2022 and 70,000 from 2020. The turnout rate was around 16.4 percent, the lowest mark since 2016, though there are far more registered voters because of automatic registration. This decrease came despite surges in turnout for municipal elections because of a2019 lawthat moved municipal races away from odd-numbered years. More than 72,000 people took part in the Las Vegas mayoral race as of Thursday afternoon, compared to about 26,000 when Carolyn Goodman cruised to re-election five years ago. And in two of the three city council seats up for grabs, turnout more than doubled from 2019. Still, turnout dropped significantly compared with the last two cycles — which Damore said might be because of the lack of a high-profile statewide race, even with mayoral candidates spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on local TV ad buys. “Even though you had some interesting races down ticket, they weren't enough to draw people there to participate without something at the top of the ticket, like a competitive governor's race or a competitive Senate primary,” Damore said. Hughes also noted that many of these municipal candidates do not have the money to make significant investments into voter outreach, so the lack of well-funded, competitive statewide races would result in less voter engagement. Despite the significantly lower turnout, mail voting in Clark County was more popular than in 2022. Sixty-three percent of Clark County votes were by mail, up from 55 percent in the 2022 primary, though that is lower than the 74 percent of people who voted by mail in February’s presidential primary. In a legislative meeting last month, Clark County Registrar Lorena Portillo said the turnout breakdown in this year’s elections would play a key role in determining how the county allocates its resources going forward, adding that it may downsize in-person election staff if mail ballots continue to be the dominant voting method. Stephanie Wheatley, a Clark County spokesperson, said last week that it would be premature to say how the primary’s results would affect future election planning. Washoe County Washoe County also saw a big dropoff in turnout this cycle. In 2020 and 2022, more than 95,000 people cast ballots in the Northern Nevada county. This year, that number fell to around 80,000, bringing the total turnout to 24.4 percent. A sign of the low turnout? Only 7,000 more Washoe County votes were cast this year than in the 2010 primary election, a year with a high-profile Senate GOP primary when there were an estimated 75,000 fewer county residents. The low turnout was evident in some local races. In the Assembly District 27 Democratic primary between lawyer Alex Velto and community organizer Heather Goulding, about 3,900 people had voted as of Friday morning, compared with the roughly 4,500 votes cast in the same race in 2022. However, the county surpassed expectations on mail voting turnout. Interim Registrar Cari-Ann Burgess told state lawmakers last month that the county expected more than half of voters to participate by mail. As of Friday morning, 70 percent of voters cast mail ballots, after about 59 percent did so two years ago. The county is planning to unveil new technology before the general election to expedite ballot processing. The new ballot sorting machine will automatically sort envelopes by precinct for all votes not cast in person on Election Day (mail votes, early votes and ballots left at drop boxes).",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/after-surprise-primary-win-can-drew-johnson-flip-nevadas-swingiest-house-seat,True,"Drew Johnson’s victory in the Congressional District 3 Republican primary was a surprise to onlookers in Washington, D.C. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) had language ready for two of his opponents but had not bothered to draft a press release for Johnson winning in advance, two sources with knowledge of the situation confirmed. (The NRCC denied that they did not have a release prepared.) But it wasn’t a shock to him. “I’ve basically been running for almost four years in almost the same district,” said Johnson, a 44-year-old tax analyst, columnist and conservative policy wonk, referring to a 2022 run for Clark County Commission that he lost by less than half a percentage point to a well-funded incumbent. “You had two guys who spent a million dollars plus on TV. We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars reaching out to voters individually.” Johnson beat the aforementioned “two guys” — video game composer Marty O’Donnell and former state Treasurer Dan Schwartz, as well as former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien — despite being significantly outraised and outspent. Both independently wealthy, O’Donnell — the preferred pick of Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) — and Schwartz entered the race in 2024 and used their personal fortunes to advertise on television. Meanwhile, Johnson (who did pour $300,000 of his own money into his campaign in spite of having a far lower net worth than his opponents) declared his candidacy in May 2023, giving him more than a year to knock doors, attend local Republican club meetings and encourage get-out-the-vote efforts through ballot harvesting. It was a strategy, he said, modeled after Nevada Democrats and their allies such as the Culinary Union. And it worked — in a low-turnout primary with four serious candidates, he won with about a third of the vote, beating second-place Schwartz by more than 3,000 votes. Clark County turnout for the primaries was a paltry 16.3 percent. Endorsed by a few members of Congress, state senators and Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony (his wife’s boss), Johnson lacked the big-name stamp of approval from Lombardo or even former President Donald Trump, who declined to enter the primary fray but endorsed in neighboring Congressional District 4. But local experts said Johnson’s 2022 Clark County Commission run and long lead time gave him an advantage. David Damore, a political scientist at UNLV, said Johnson’s name identification likely boosted him — but cautioned against reading too much into a low-turnout primary where the vote was split in so many directions. “Thirty percent is not exactly a strong party endorsement,” Damore said. Now, Johnson will face Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), a formidable fundraiser who has won three straight elections in the competitive Southern Nevada district, which leans Democratic according to the Cook Political Report and which outside Republican groups are increasingly bearish on after droppingmore than $15 millionto no avail in 2022. But Johnson — a libertarian-leaning Republican who has had plenty of criticism for Trump over the years — believes he is a better candidate to take on Lee than firebrands from past cycles such as former pro wrestler Dan Rodimer and frequent candidate Danny Tarkanian. “Somebody running as a really hard-right person against Susie Lee doesn't work,” Johnson said. “People understand that this district is kind of more small-l libertarian than anything, and I'm pretty reflective of that vibe or ideology that the district has. I think I'm a better fit than the people who have run against her in the past.” Who is Drew Johnson? Johnson grew up in rural eastern Tennessee (“imagine where Dolly Parton’s from”) and was raised by a single mother who had to work two jobs to support her family. He said he grew up in a trailer home and lived out of his car at one point while starting his career — a story he says he hopes resonates with residents of Las Vegas, a place he said people move to “to live their American Dream.” Johnson has spent nearly two decades working in conservative think tanks and outlets, spending time at groups like the National Taxpayers Union, the American Enterprise Institute andThe Washington Times. Much of his research highlights waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government — he is most famous forusing public recordsto calculate climate champion and former Vice President Al Gore’s home energy use in Tennessee. He moved to Southern Nevada in 2015 because his wife, looking to start a business, wanted to move somewhere friendly to small businesses. Johnson and his wife, Sarah, started the Vegas Golden Knights “victory flamingo” fan trend of throwing plastic flamingos onto the ice after wins. He’s a big fan of the city’s Chinese and Ethiopian restaurants, frequenting Chinatown and Rainbow Blvd. An avid hiker (he and his wife hiked to Everest Base Camp six months ago), he enjoys the local trails in Las Vegas and Laughlin. And he’s a frequent visitor at the Pioneer Saloon in Goodsprings. Johnson’s years of public conservative writing make his opinions on a variety of topics easy to find for fans and opposition researchers alike, from his support ofgay marriageto opposition totariffsto sayingoil companies’ tax rates are too high. So why go from advising Congress on policy to trying to be a member? Johnson says it’s because he believes he can be a more effective watchdog from the inside and that too many members of Congress lack policy depth. “It sounds Pollyanna, but I really wake up and say, ‘How can I advance liberty today?’” Johnson said. “What can I do to get government out of the way?” To that end, he has put a significant amount of his own money into the race. Johnson loaned his campaign $300,000 over the course of the primary — though he is not obligated to spend it and can return what is unspent back to himself. A similar dynamic played out in his 2022 commission race — Johnsonloanedhis campaign $100,000 after the primary, butpaid himself backafter the race was over in December. Hispersonal financial disclosureplaces his net worth at between about $218,000 and $641,000. As a longtime observer of Congress, he is not naive to the relative lack of power of back-bench freshmen. He said constituent services would be a significant focus — an area where he accused Lee of having “fallen off” based on conversations he had with voters on the trail who complained Lee’s office had been unresponsive. Lee’s campaign noted that she was one of five members of Congress to benominatedfor a 2024 Democracy Award for constituent service from the nonpartisan Congressional Management Foundation, and her office has closed more than 7,000 cases and returned more than $31 million to Southern Nevadans through casework. True to libertarian form, he said the current members of Congress who impress him the most are Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), two libertarians who frequently find themselves as the lone “no” vote on bills that every other member supports, particularly on national security. Massie, nicknamed “Mr. No,” is virulently against government spending and often the government himself, voting against everything from disaster relief to a resolution condemning antisemitism. Johnson said that though both can be overly combative, he respects how principled they are. “When Massie is voting for 434-1, I'm not going to say that I'm always going to be 433-2 along with him,” Johnson said. “But there will be times where I'm sure that that will happen.” That skepticism of his own party has frequently extended to Trump. In posts from his now locked personal account on X, JohnsoncalledTrump a “socialist” during the 2016 race,calledhis presidency an “embarrassment” in 2020 over a federal execution during the lame-duck period andsaidJoe Biden’s 2020 victory was “an endorsement of humanity, restraint & kindness.” But this year, Johnson — who locked his account on X over death threats —endorsedTrump for president on Jan. 11, knocked doors for him during the caucus andattacked primary opponentsfor their own past Trump criticism. Is the about-face an electoral necessity? Johnson (who responded and explained each post in an email) said the endorsement comes from Trump being a better candidate than Biden on every issue he cares about, even if he still disagrees with him on issues such as tariffs. He said if both are elected, he would call Trump out when he’s taking actions that don’t advance fiscal conservatism and said he would be more independent-minded than Lee — though Lee herself is one of the more bipartisan members of Congress, breaking with her party on about9 percent of votesin 2023, tied for 11th among 213 House Democrats, according to aRoll Callanalysis. But Johnson also said he wants to be in Congress to help move the Republican Party beyond Trump, who can only serve one more term as president and is likely running in his last election. “We've got to figure out — when there's not this kind of cult of personality — what does the party return to?” Johnson said. “Does it follow Trump and become more populist? Does it become more like what I would like to see, which is a more free market, limited government, small-l libertarian, big tent party? That's what I'm hoping to help create.” Policy positions If elected, Johnson said the issue he would be most excited to tackle is Social Security. Social Security trustees’ annual report projected that if Congress makes no changes to the program, its trust fund will be depleted by 2035 — though through tax revenue, the Social Security Administration would still be able to pay 83 percent of scheduled benefits, according to the left-leaningCenter for Budget and Policy Priorities. There are a number of ways this shortfall could be addressed — more immigration, for example, puts less pressure on Social Security by increasing the number of workers paying into it, the trustees note. Alternatively, the majority of House Republicansbelievethe retirement age should be raised from 65 to address the coming solvency challenge. That’s an opinion Johnson has held in the past — in a 2016tweeton his private account, he said, “65 yr olds…could be working, but don’t b/c of failed policy.” Today, Johnson says that he believes Social Security can be made solvent without raising the retirement age through a mix of auditing the Social Security Disability Insurance rolls, which contain about 4 percent of Americans, to remove people he says are improperly using it, and cutting other programs and returning the subsequent savings to Social Security. “I'm sure the Democrats just can't wait to beat up on me and every Republican for Social Security,” Johnson said. “But I'm taking a very realistic approach.” True to form, it’s an issue the Lee campaign believes they can attack him on. “Drew Johnson has never actually put in the work to help Nevadans, and now he wants to go to Congress to turn his extreme positions into law like gutting Social Security and healthcare programs that help families and seniors live, banning abortion, and making Nevada the nation’s nuclear waste dumping ground,” Lee spokesperson Kevin Winslow said in a statement. Johnson has not called for an abortion ban, and said the2022DobbsdecisionoverturningRoe v. Wade“appropriately” left the question to the states. He said he would vote against both a national abortion ban and any government funding for abortion services. Despite abortion access powering Democrats, including Lee, to electoral victory in 2022, he believes he can make a stronger countercase. “She's the extremist because she supports the use of tax dollars to fund late-term abortions,” Johnson said, echoing a popular Republican talking point about Democrats’ signature abortion proposal, which would reinstate theRoestandard and keep states from restrictingabortion after fetal viability in cases where the life or health of the mother is endangered. Johnson, like most Republicans, is hoping to make the election a referendum on the border — the issue he said came up most often when talking to voters throughout the primary, particularly from first- or second-generation immigrants. His preferred approach would be to “close the border” while streamlining the process by which legal immigrants are vetted and then allowed into the U.S. “You need to make it easier for people not to be encouraged to break the law by making it as easy as it should be to come legally,” Johnson said. “Right now, the backup is crazy. The resources aren't there to do it the right way.” Where would that strategy leave undocumented immigrants currently in the U.S., including DACA recipients? Johnson said it would be unfair to extend the privileges of legal permanent residency or citizenship to those who came to the U.S. illegally, even if they were brought as children. But he said offering legal protection from deportation for Dreamers could be a potential point of compromise. “I really don't like setting any precedent that says if you come over illegally, your kids are taken care of,” he said. National groups likely staying out A national Republican strategist familiar with Nevada said that though they did not expect Johnson to win the primary, he is “normal” and would not scare outside groups away from spending. What does scare them is the district’s electoral history. After spending millions of dollars in Nevada in 2022, House Republicans are now facing down a defensive map requiring them to protect vulnerable incumbents in the expensive media markets of Los Angeles and New York City. National groups do not expect to place ads in Las Vegas (which will already be oversaturated with presidential and Senate spending) barring any new dynamics. A national Democratic strategist with knowledge of the race who was granted anonymity to speak freely said they feel confident about defending all of their Nevada House incumbents — and extra excited about Johnson, who they believe will be easy to attack based on his years’ worth of writing about policies such as Social Security and the Affordable Care Act. Republicans are more bullish on John Lee in Congressional District 4, a well-known former elected official who self-funded his primary bid. Multiple strategists suggested outside groups could spend money on Lee if he plunges his own considerable resources into the race, but it would likely come as a last-minute boost if they believed he had a real shot. And even if House Republican groups do decide to invest in the state, Democrats can easily match fire with fire. That’s especially true for Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, who has enormous fundraising capability if needed and whom the national Democratic political apparatus is deeply invested in defending — a dynamic Republican strategists are wary of triggering. “The three incumbents are going to be able to raise as much as they need to,” said Damore, the UNLV political scientist. “They'll be able to draw on any party support and outside group support if they think that it's going to be needed.” Johnson is not naive to his uphill battle. But he believes he won the primary because he has the best chance of doing what three prior Republican candidates have failed to do — beat Lee. “Susie and I disagree on most things, but she's not an idiot,” Johnson said. “I respect her, and I think that I'm just a much better matchup against Susie than anybody else would have been.” This story was updated at 12:20 p.m. on 6/16/24 to remove a detail about the time that the NRCC’s press release was sent out. The press release was sent the following morning because of the late time that Johnson’s race was called.This story was updated again 2:00 p.m. to add the NRCC’s denial of not having a press release prepared.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/after-bitter-primary-culinary-union-legislative-democrats-not-singing-kumbaya-yet,True,"When the state’s politically powerful Culinary Union tried to unseat a sitting legislator, it was a declaration of the labor organization’s frustration with some of its closest allies. The union targeted Sen. Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas) by putting up nurse Geoconda Hughes (the daughter of former Culinary Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Argüello-Kline) to run against her in the Senate District 3 Democratic primary because Nguyen helped present a bill in the 2023 legislative session that unwound pandemic-era hotel cleaning requirements. Nearly half a million dollars was spent on ads in the contest, most of it in support of Nguyen, in the most public split yet between legislative Democrats and the union. The union has been credited with helping national and state Democrats win contentious races in past election cycles through its widespread canvassing efforts and political operation. In the end, Nguyen defeated Hughes in Tuesday’s primary by more than 10 percentage points, but questions linger about whether the discord will persist through a pivotal November election. The union’s organizing and canvassing efforts could mean the difference between defeat and victory for Democrats who are trying to secure a veto-proof supermajority in the Legislature, maintain a Senate seat that could decide the balance of power in the U.S. Senate and secure a second term for President Joe Biden. So where does the relationship stand four days after the primary, and what might a similar effort by Nevada’s powerful gaming industry in 2022 that failed to take out three incumbents tell us about whether the sides will reconcile? Shelby Wiltz, the campaign manager for the Democratic Coordinated campaign, which coordinates between the various Democratic campaigns up and down the ballot, credited the Culinary Union as integral to ensuring Democratic victories in federal and down-ballot elections in previous elections, and said this year is no different. “[The union’s] efforts in the past, and what they've spoken about doing publicly, will certainly be a critical piece of our path to victory,” Wiltz said, adding that Democratic elected officials in Nevada have supported and worked with Culinary. Those officials include Biden, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a former Culinary Union member, and Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), who spent several years as the CEO of Culinary Training Academy before being elected to Congress. “We have total faith that Culinary is going to do everything in their power to make sure that they are electing the right representatives to stand up for workers and to stand up for working class families, just like we are,” Wiltz said. Culinary Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge is not yet committing to supporting all legislative Democrats, as in years past. He said in an interview that the union would support candidates “that are going to do the right thing.” “The idea that somehow we just line up behind Democrats because we have nowhere else to go, which I think is the attitude to some of these statewide Democrats, voters aren't going to follow that,” Pappageorge said. “And the Democrats are going to pay a price for that in November if they don't correct.” All eyes are on the general election Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which iscredited with delivering a victoryto Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) in 2022, alsounendorsed 18 Democratic state lawmakers running this cycleand backed a union member against a Democratic establishment-backed candidate. By drawing a bright red line through 18 names on the union’s endorsement scorecard and attempting to oust a well-liked incumbent, the union was protesting Democratic legislators' passage ofSB441, a 2023 resort industry-backed bill removing pandemic-imposed cleaning requirements from state law, including daily room cleaning. Union leadership portrayed the bill’s passage as anti-worker, anti-Democrat and an infringement of hotel worker protections. Legislative Democrats, the gaming industry and public health officials said the bill sunsetted a COVID-era law that was no longer needed. The 60,000-member union, the state’s largest labor organization, later made daily room cleaning part of thefive-year contract negotiationswith major Las Vegas resorts. Pappageorge said the organization is committed to supporting candidates who back workers, adding that the disagreement with legislative Democrats is not irreconcilable. He said the union will door-knock and canvass for President Joe Biden in the general election, but indicated that the union isn’t ready to kiss and make up with legislative Democrats. “We haven't had a better, working-class, pro-worker, pro-middle class president in our lifetime than President Biden,” Pappageorge said. “Politics are local, and these state Democrats, when they decide they're going to belly up to the bar with corporate America at the expense of working class voters, there's a price to pay for that.” However, he didn’t explain what legislative Democrats would need to do to reconcile with Culinary, only reiterating that they needed to support workers. Nguyen, who the union targeted for helping present the bill though she didn’t sponsor it, toldThe Nevada Independentthat everyone has the right to run for public office, and that’s part of a healthy democracy. She said she is ready to move forward from the primary and isn’t worried about working with the Culinary in the future. “I think we all want what’s best for Nevada,” Nguyen said. “I will continue to have the same open-door policy I have always had. I'm always willing to listen.” Asked about the union’s relationship with the state’s Democratic political organizing framework (often dubbed the “Reid Machine” for its connections to the late Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV)), Pappageorge said that it should be called the “Culinary Machine” and the criticism leveled against lawmakers was not just about the Democrats. “Every single Republican voted to repeal the daily room cleaning also,” Pappageorge said. “We had obviously no support there.” An example of the union’s commitment to Democrats came when former President Donald Trump promised at a Las Vegas campaign rally to ​​stop taxing tips that workers receive. The Culinary Unionfired back with a statementcalling it “wild campaign promises” that Nevada workers were too intelligent to fall for. The Culinary Union's challenge of Nguyen had support from its affiliated Bartenders Local 165, Nevada's three Teamsters Locals, the Nevada State Education Association (NSEA), the National Nurses United and  United Food and Commercial Workers Local 711. The lawmaker was backed by other unions, including American Federation of State County Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 4041 — which represents 17,000 state workers — the Clark County Education Association and the Las Vegas branches of the Service Employees International Union, Laborers Union (which represents construction workers) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The Southern Nevada Building Trades Unions, an alliance of craft unions, also endorsed Nguyen. Executive Secretary Vince Saavedra said the organization “wasn’t anti-Culinary” in backing Nguyen. “I would like to think that there was no love lost when we decided to go with Rochelle,” Saavedra said. “I had a lot of good, open conversations with nurse Geo. Now that we're in the general, I see the construction unions and labor standing together stronger than ever.” Challenging legislative Democrats and re-evaluating unendorsements One bright spot for the Culinary Union on Tuesday was a victory for Linda Hunt, a Culinary-backed candidate who won the Democratic primary in North Las Vegas’ reliably blue, open Assembly District 17 against Assembly Democratic Caucus-backed candidate Mishon Montgomery. Hunt is expected to win the general election because the district’s party registration overwhelmingly favors Democrats. Pappageorge said that the union will continue to challenge incumbents and establishment-backed candidates who take anti-worker approaches, which implies stances against Culinary members. He said the union doesn’t blanket endorse any candidate. The primary and general elections are completely separate, he said, adding that the main focus of Culinary’s unendorsements was informing its members of which lawmakers in the Legislature supported them. “We're just going to make sure we do what it takes to represent working class voters and make sure the Democratic Party is a force for workers,” Pappageorge said. “If the Democrats get too far on the side of big money interests and the casino interests, like where we think Rochelle went, we're going to call them out.” In the past, Nguyen has supported and opposed a variety of Culinary Union-backed measures. She voted against the Culinary-backed bill to publicly finance the construction of a baseball stadium to bring Major League Baseball’s Oakland Athletics to Las Vegas, supported a bill that allocated $25 million to the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas and voted forCulinary’s proposed constitutional amendmentremoving the prohibition on state lotteries. She said she didn’t regret voting for the measure to sunset daily room cleaning along with other COVID-era policies because the original bill had planned to end the policy based on testing positivity rates, which are no longer accurate because of at-home tests and a lack of reporting. As for criticism from Pappageorge about taking contributions from the casino and gaming industry, Nguyen said part of running for office includes fundraising and that doesn’t influence her vote. She added that the gaming industry did financially support her this election cycle, but she also accepted contributions from the Oakland A’s and voted against their bill during the legislative session. “I really do just look at every single bill individually, to figure out what we can do and whether or not it's something that I can support, and whether or not it's something that a community that elected me, would also want to support,” Nguyen said. A similar situation The Culinary’s actions against Nguyen and the endorsement of other legislative Democrats isn’t the first time a powerful organization has tried to oust lawmakers over policy disagreements. In the 2022 primary, the Nevada Resort Association — the leading trade organization for the state’s casino industry — formed a political action committee and raised more than $2.3 million from its members to recruit, assess, endorse and elect state legislative candidates. The group spent $1.5 million backing four candidates in the primary, including two that challenged incumbent lawmakers.Three of the candidateslost their races. R&R Partners CEO Billy Vassiliadis, a longtime lobbyist for the resort association, said Culinary’s targeting of Nguyen and unendorsements of Democrats were similar to the organization’s actions in 2022. He said the main difference was the resort association targeted lawmakers for their overall stance on gaming issues, not just their support for a single piece of legislation. “It was a drum beat,” Vassiliadis recalled. “It was an anti-gaming, anti-industry, anti-resorts, anti-business. We weren't the only ones who got involved in those races,” adding the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce and other business groups joined in the effort. Vassiliadis said the resort association’s PAC was active again in this year’s primary but was not as public-facing with its support. He said Nguyen earned the gaming organization’s backing because “she's a good legislator. She’s thoughtful and open.” Resort association representatives testified in support of SB441 during legislative hearings. “We would have supported Rochelle, regardless [of SB441],” Vassiliadis said. “She’s not a 100 percenter. No one expects anybody to be. This wasn't a, ‘Let's go fight the Culinary.’ [Nguyen] is a legislator that we were going to support anyway. Our support may have been maybe stronger than it would have otherwise.” One issue where the gaming industry and the Culinary remain in opposition is the lottery resolution, which requires a second affirmative vote by lawmakers before it could go in front of the voters in 2026. Culinary is backing AJR5, and the stated goal for lottery proceeds is to fund funding for youth mental health services. Even with gaming’s strong opposition to the bill, Vassiliadis said Nguyen’s support wasn’t an issue. “There’s an objectivity [with Nguyen] that I think is very valuable. She’s a leader. There are too many issues that we need to stay together on,” Vassiliadis said. “We can't continue to carry these political battles forward.” He was hopeful any torn relationships would be stitched back together when lawmakers return to Carson City next February. He said basic disagreements happen in campaigns and even though the resort association ran candidates against incumbents in 2022, it didn’t have a lasting negative effect. “I don't know that the Legislature is more difficult than contract negotiations,” Vassiliadis said, referencing the union’s collective bargaining sessions that spanned months and resulted in new five-year agreements with the resort industry.“We'll face issues again where we're not on the same side, but I think we've been able to come together to help the tourism industry, and I expect that to continue.” Updated at 2:55 p.m. on 6/16/2024 to include labor groups backing the Culinary.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/here-are-the-winners-in-southern-nevadas-local-government-primaries,True,"Former Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV) and Las Vegas City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman emerged victorious in a high-profile Las Vegas mayoral race primary that’s turning out to be more about politics than is reflected by the race’s nonpartisan label. Las Vegas City Council incumbents Brian Knudsen and Olivia Diaz won their seats outright after Tuesday’s primary, but an open seat on the council has now become a contest between two former Assembly colleagues. And another state lawmaker will vie for a seat on the Clark County Commission, the most powerful local government body in the state, against a well-funded Republican attorney who has run close races against powerful Democrats in the two past cycles. Here’s a look at how Tuesday’s primaries turned out for Southern Nevada local government candidates, including in Henderson, North Las Vegas and Boulder City. Las Vegas Mayor Las Vegas City Council Clark County Commission Other Southern Nevada local government races Las Vegas Mayor Berkley topped the field of 14 mayoral candidates running in Tuesday’s primary and will advance to a November runoff. As of Thursday afternoon, she had won 35 percent of the vote and garnered around 5,000 more votes than Seaman, who was 7,000 votes ahead of fellow City Councilman Cedric Crear. The position of Las Vegas mayor is nonpartisan, meaning that candidates don’t list a party preference and all registered voters are allowed to vote in the primary. The top two vote-getters in the primary advance to the general election, unless one candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, in which case that person is considered elected to the office. If elected, Berkley would return to politics a dozen years after she lost a high-profile race to unseat Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in 2012, which ended her 14-year congressional career. Seaman has represented Ward 2 on the city council since 2019. Though the position is nonpartisan, the race between Seaman and Berkley is likely to have strong partisan undertones. Seaman, a former Republican assemblywoman, openly appealed to Republican voters during the primary and said she plans to vote for former President Donald Trump in this year’s presidential election. Berkley, a lifelong Democrat, said she will vote to re-elect President Joe Biden. In aforum hosted byThe Nevada Independentlast month, Berkley and Seaman feuded over crime levels in the city, with Seaman saying crime — particularly property crime — is “out of control in the city.” The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, however, reported a 10 percent decrease in property crimes in the first three months of 2024 compared with the same period last year, accordingto a statewide crime database. Ata victory partyTuesday, Seaman said she would be a “law and order mayor” so that Las Vegas does not “end up like our neighboring cities because of far-left liberal policies.” Las Vegas City Council Two incumbent city council members easily won their re-election bids outright, while a third primary will head to a runoff after no candidate received a majority of the vote. Assemblywoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong (D-Las Vegas) and former Assemblyman C.H. Miller (D-North Las Vegas) will face off in the November election for Ward 5 after being the top two vote-getters on Tuesday, raking in 31 percent and 19 percent, respectively. The Ward 5 seat will be vacated by Crear, who had been in office since 2018. Summers-Armstrong, who is in her second term as an assemblywoman, received endorsements from an assortment of veterans and law enforcement groups, as well as the Culinary Union and the Service Employees International Union’s Nevada chapter, which represents health care and public service workers. Miller, meanwhile, had the backing of Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), the Southern Nevada Building Trades Unions and other labor organizations. In addition, Ward 3 Councilwoman Olivia Diaz will avoid a runoff  after clearing the 50 percent threshold Tuesday. Diaz’s re-election race was among the most high-profile city races, as she went up against Melissa Clary, who’s been active on historic preservation projects in the city, in a rematch of their 2019 race. Diaz improved upon her 2019 performance when she won by less than 100 votes in the general election. As of Wednesday evening, Diaz led Clary by more than 1,000 votes and 20 percentage points. PACs linked to Laborers Local 872, the union that represents Las Vegas construction workers, gave more than $50,000 to Clary’s campaign as of the end of March (slightly less than half of her total fundraising haul) after previously giving $100,000 to Diaz (out of around $600,000 raised in total) ahead of the 2019 election. Diaz toldThe Nevada Independentearlier this year that she thinks the union’s change in support resulted from a vote she made in 2020 that went against the Laborers’ position. The city council hadvoted4-3 in 2020 to repeal a 2018 ordinance requiring developers to take additional steps to meet with residents before beginning redevelopment projects on golf courses and open spaces. Union members supported the repeal — arguing it was necessary to protect union jobs — but Diaz was one of the three members to oppose the repeal. Union officials did not return repeated interview requests fromThe Indy. In Ward 1, Brian Knudsen, the mayor pro tem who has been in office since 2019, easily won re-election, winning more than 60 percent of the vote in a three-candidate field. Clark County Commission Primary season was sleepy for the Clark County Commission, considered the most powerful local government board in the state because of its oversight on business, infrastructure and certain funding allocations for a majority of Nevada’s population. But things are expected to heat up in the general election. The primary featured three county commission races, with Republican and Democratic primaries in the District C race determining which candidates will face off in November. Commissioner Ross Miller, a Democrat, is not seeking re-election. Democrat Shannon Bilbray-Axelrod and Republican April Becker advanced to the general election for the District C seat. Bilbray-Axelrod — who received 72 percent of the vote against Hunter Cain in the primary — is a four-term assemblywoman who left her seat to run for a county commission position. Bilbray-Axelrod’s biggest donor at $10,000 wasPlumbers & Pipefitters Local No. 525,a plumbing and service technician union. Becker — an attorney who received 69 percent of the vote Tuesday night — ran an unsuccessful campaign against Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) in the 2022 general election for Congressional District 3. Becker received donations from three political action committees run by Tommy White, a leader for Laborers’ International Union of North AmericaLocal 872for a total of $20,000. Becker hadnearly $300,000in hand at the end of the last campaign finance period. Meanwhile, Ryan Hamilton won the District A Republican primary Tuesday and will face Democratic incumbent Michael Naft in the November election. Among Naft’s top donors giving the maximum of $10,000 donations were the parent company of the Oakland Athletics, state Treasurer Zach Conine’sLet’s Get to Work Nevada PACand MGM Resorts International. Hamilton’s largest donor at $5,205 was James Thomson, an adviser to the president of regional development at UNLV and former CEO of the RAND Corp., a policy consulting firm. Two other seats on the commission are up in 2024, but did not require primary elections because not enough candidates filed. In District B, Democratic Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick is running for re-election against Libertarian candidate Jesse Welsh, while Democratic Commissioner William McCurdy II is running for re-election in District D against Republican candidate David Gomez in a heavily Democratic district. Other Southern Nevada local government races Henderson Incumbents on the Henderson City Council, which governs the second most-populated city in Nevada behind Las Vegas, found success Tuesday, with council members Jim Seebock and Dan Stewart winning outright with more than 50 percent of the vote. Council races are nonpartisan, with the top two vote-getters advancing to the general election unless a candidate wins more than 50 percent of primary votes. Meanwhile, Councilman Dan Shaw faced a more competitive race that will likely lead to a runoff with runner-up Monica “Doc” Larson. Shaw received 42 percent of the vote, 9 percentage points more than Larson. North Las Vegas Councilwoman Ruth Garcia Anderson will proceed to a general election runoff to retain her nonpartisan city council seat in Ward 2. Garcia Anderson will face Robert “Twixx” Taylor, who has owned various small businesses and is a health advocate, in November after the two each received about 39 percent of the vote. Councilman Richard Cherchio did not face any opponents in the Ward 4 primary and will be elected to another term. North Las Vegas residents also voted to pass both Questions 1 and 2 on the ballot, which will renew a property tax of less than 30 cents for every $100 in property valuation to fund police, parks, fire and other emergency and community services. City leadersinitiallywanted the measures to be considered at a single-issue December special election, but the vote waspostponedto coincide with the primary over concerns from state election officials that a December election arrangement would attract too low of participation. Boulder City Boulder City Councilwoman/Mayor Pro Tem Sherri Jorgensen won her seat in the primary. Denise Ashurst, a retired veteran, will face incumbent Matt Fox for the second open seat on the Boulder City Council. Mesquite Mesquite is the fastest-growing city in Nevada, with a10.5 percent population increasefrom 2020 to 2023. No incumbents won outright in two Mesquite City Council races. Mayor Al Litman, who has been mayor since 2014, will face Jesse Whipple, who is on the city’s master plan committee, in the general election for mayor. Seat 2 on the Mesquite City Council is also up for election, with Kevin Parrish and Ronald Shackelford advancing to the general election.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/beadles-backed-candidates-come-up-short-in-washoe-down-ballot-primary-races,True,"June 11 proved to be a rough night for Robert Beadles, a prominent Republican donor and election conspiracy theorist who formally endorsed 12 candidates for local races in Washoe County and supported others. Only three made it to the general. Beadles did not respond to a request for comment. Washoe County Commissioner Clara Andriola defeated opponents Mark Lawson and Tracey Hilton-Thomas — who both received endorsements but no funds from Beadles — in the crowded Republican primary. Marsha Berkbigler — who served two terms on the commission before she was defeated by now-Commission Chair Alexis Hill in 2020 — will face Hill in November in a rematch for the District 1 seat. Berkbigler has financial ties to Beadles but said she does not share his belief that the 2020 election was stolen. Meanwhile, Reno Councilmen Devon Reese and Miguel Martinez advanced past the primary to the general election. A political action committee affiliated with Beadles, who supported Reese’s opponent Brian Cassidy, sent out mailers during the primary depicting Reese as a drag queen. Martinez will challenge Denise Myer, who also has ties to Beadles, in November. Beadles’ blog Operation Sunlight also called Andriola “Clara the Clown” and Washoe County School Board Trustee Beth Smith “Death Smith” after her battle with cancer. In Sparks, longtime Councilman Donald Abbott defeated Beadles-endorsed candidate Chris Garvey with more than 50 percent of the votes during the primary to retain his Ward 1 seat for a third and final term. The two other Sparks incumbents, Paul Anderson and Kristopher Dahir, will face challengers Brad Fitch and Joe Rodriguez in the general election. Here’s a look at how Tuesday’s primaries turned out for the Washoe County Commission, Reno and Sparks city councils and other local governments in Northern Nevada. Andriola’s win in District 4 and why it matters An endorsement from Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo proved more valuable to candidates than support from Beadles in Northern Nevada, at least for Washoe County Commissioner Clara Andriola, who was also appointed by the governor in 2023. During her primary election campaign, Andriola — a former director of the Reno Rodeo Foundation who received nearly 44 percent of the vote as of Thursday — faced a primary field of four other Republicans. This group included Mark Lawson — a former City of Sparks fire chief who waspublicly let gowhen the city council learned about four felony drug charges against him — who received almost a quarter of the votes. The drug chargeswere later dismissed, andhe recently received a$381,000 settlementfrom the City of Sparks for wrongful termination. Another District 4 candidate, Tracey Hilton-Thomas, received almost 21 percent of the vote. She describes herself as having expertise in election work and a long history working for Washoe County, although her employment history is in tech for the county. Both Lawson — who was the second-highest vote-getter in the primary — and Hilton-Thomas — who came in third — received endorsements but no funds from Beadles, and both lost to Andriola, who was appointed to the commission by Lombardo last year and featured the governor’s endorsement in a TV ad campaign. “The election is validation that Washoe County voters care about policy not politics,” Andriola said about the election results. “I'm so grateful for the chance to continue serving District 4 — and all of Washoe County.” Andriola will face two non-major party candidates in the general election. Commissioners Mike Clark and Jeanne Herman both have connections to Beadles and the two are known for voting together on the five-person board on high-profile issues. Though a majority of the votes on the Washoe County Commission are unanimous, Andriola is sometimes a swing vote on the Republican-majority commission — a fact that the Washoe GOP cited in kicking her out of the party. Beadles is on the executive board of the county party. The morning after the primary, Beadles published a blog post thanking “all the candidates who put themselves out there for us” and casting doubt on the election results by criticizing the lack of voter ID. Meanwhile, Commissioner Alexis Hill, the only Democrat running for the Washoe County Commission this election, will face Marsha Berkbigler in the general election. Berkbigler won the Republican primary for the District 1 race with 51 percent of the vote. Berkbigler is the only candidate this election cycle who has received direct financial support from Beadles, but said she does not support his views on election denial. Hill and Berkbigler also faced each other in the 2020 election, with Hill beating Berkbigler by about 10 percentage points. Two Reno city councilmen will face Beadles-backed candidates in the fall Reno City Council had four seats open this election for Ward 1, 3, 5 and the newly created Ward 6. Unlike the county commission, seats on the city council are nonpartisan. None of the candidates received more than 50 percent of the vote, but even if they did the City of Reno does not count a majority of the vote in the primary as an outright win. Councilman Miguel Martinez received a majority of votes in the Ward 3 primary with 48 percent of the vote as of Thursday, with the second highest number of votes (22 percent) going to Denise Myer. Myer — whom Beadles supported in the 2022 election — ran an unsuccessful county commission campaign against Mariluz Garcia in the 2022 election but continued to question Garcia’s residency in communications to the county district attorney despite the office saying the claim was false. Councilman Devon Reese — an attorney who has been the at-large member of the Reno City Council since his appointment in 2019 — received almost 38 percent of the vote in his bid for Ward 6. His likely opponent in the general election, Brian Cassidy — another Beadles-endorsed candidate — received 27 percent of the vote. Reese represents an at-large ward that is being eliminated this election cycle. Leading up to the primary election, one of Beadles’ political action committees sent out mailers depicting Reese as a drag queen. Reese later posted the mailer onXwith links to donate and volunteer for Reese’s campaign. In Ward 1, Councilwoman Kathleen Taylor — who represents Ward 5 but had her address change wards after redistricting — received 30 percent of the vote and will either face former Washoe County Library Board Chair Frank Perez, who received nearly 24 percent of the vote as of Thursday morning. Lily Baran, a housing activist and former American Civil Liberties Union lobbyist, is in third place as of Thursday morning with just over 50 votes separating her and Perez In the newly created Ward 6, Brandi Anderson, a marketing professional who owns a consulting firm, received far more votes than her competitors.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-democrats-sue-to-block-green-party-from-2024-ballot,True,"The Nevada Democratic Party is seeking to invalidate the Green Party’s effort to land on the state’s November ballot, arguing it did not gather enough valid signatures to gain ballot access. In alawsuitfiled Monday in Carson City District Court, the state party asked the court to invalidate the signatures gathered and prohibit the secretary of state’s office from approving the Green Party from qualifying for the November general election. According to the lawsuit, the Democratic Party reviewed a limited number of signatures via a public records request, and said its initial findings (which did not include a review of signatures submitted in Clark and Washoe counties) indicated that most of the signatures are invalid. Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat, said in an interview Thursday that the office’s legal representation is reviewing the lawsuit, and that “if there’s an issue for us to address, I assume we’ll address it.” The Green Party has not been on a Nevada general election ballot since 2008, when its candidate received around 1,400 votes. Including a qualified minor party on the ballot — one potentially able to pull dissatisfied left-leaning voters away from the Democratic Party — could have major impacts on the presidential race in Nevada, where President Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in 2020 by only about 33,000 votes out of more than a million cast. The Green Partygatherednearly 30,000 petition signatures to land on the general election ballot, well more than the required amount of 10,095 signatures, which must be split evenly across Nevada’s four congressional districts. The partyannouncedMonday that “as of this moment, the Nevada Green Party is on the Ballot.” The party has not submitted a candidate yet for the November ballot, but the party's former presidential candidate Jill Stein is running again this year. Stein called the lawsuit “outrageous” in avideoposted to her campaign website. Lawyers representing the Nevada Democratic Party filed public records requests to review the Green Party’s submitted signatures and petition, but the lawsuit said they had only received a handful of signatures and no copies of the petition. “We have filed this challenge to preserve our rights to inspect the petitions consistent with Nevada state law,” Hilary Barrett, the executive director of the Nevada Democratic Party, said in a statement. The Democratic Party says that the limited number of signatures that it was able to review did not meet the state’s requirements and should be invalidated. For example, some of the signatures were gathered in 2023, which is before the Green Party filed its certificate of continued existence with state election officials in January. The lawsuit alleges thar some petition signatures were gathered before the petition had been approved and should not be considered valid. Margery Hanson, the co-chair of the Nevada Green Party, toldThe Nevada Independenton Wednesday that it submitted its petition in October and denied breaking any rules. In addition, some of the sworn affidavits on petition forms had been altered to change the county of the petition circulator, exhibit documents show. “Despite not having received all the signed petitions the Green Party submitted to the Secretary of State and the counties, upon information and belief, the Green Party did not and could not submit sufficient verified signatures from the petition districts to qualify as a minor political party with ballot access under Nevada law,” the lawsuit said.",Error: Connection error.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/school-board-races-beadles-backed-candidates-lose-most-moms-for-liberty-picks-advance,True,"None of the candidates backed by Robert Beadles, an election denier, far-right provocateur and prominent GOP donor, will advance in their races on the Washoe County School Board, according to preliminary results from Tuesday's primary elections. But in Clark County,Moms for Liberty— a conservative group that opposes LGBTQ+-related school books and policies, resists curriculum related to diversity, equity and inclusion, and has been called an anti-government extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center — did better, with three candidates it supported advancing in the Clark County School Board and State Board of Education races. Some incumbents are on track to win their elections outright and retain their seats without needing to go on to a general election, according to the preliminary results. Under state law, nonpartisan municipal races including the school board and Board of Regents races can be decided in a primary if one candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote. Here’s what results look like statewide. Clark County School Board District A Emily Stevens, the vice president of a credit union, and Karl Catarata, the Nevada State director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, are advancing in the District A race for the seat currently held by Trustee Lisa Guzman, who’s not seeking re-election. District A includes parts of Henderson and Boulder City. In addition to her work as the vice president of business development for SCE Credit Union, Stevens is theboard chairfor Clark High School’s Academy of Finance and sits on the advisory committees for Mission High School, UNLV and the nonprofit Communities in Schools of Southern Nevada. Catarata is a Clark County School District (CCSD) graduate and son of a teacher. He also serves as the chairman for the Nevada Commission on Mentoring. District B Moms for Liberty Clark County chapter member Lydia Dominguez and former educator Eileen Eady are advancing in the District B race to represent parts of the northwest valley, Indian Springs, Bunkerville and the Moapa area. According toher website, Dominguez is an Air Force veteran, a mother of two district students and was appointed in 2022 to the district’s Attendance Zoning Advisory Committee by District B Trustee Katie Williams. Eady, a political campaign consultant, isformer teacher and paraprofessionalwith experience in large and small districts and in special education. She ran for the District F seat in 2018, butlost in the primary. District C The District C race will be a rematch between Board President Evelyn Garcia Morales and Tameka Henry, who lost in the 2020 primary election. Garcia Morales has served on the board since 2021. Henry is the executive director of The Obodo Collective, a local nonprofit focused on supporting communities in Clark County through initiatives such as an urban farm and helping people apply for rental assistance. District C includes parts of central Las Vegas and North Las Vegas. District E Moms for Liberty Clark County Chapter Vice Chair Lorena Biassotti and former district special education teacher and education advocate Kamilah Bywaters are advancing in the District B race, which includes western parts of the valley and Summerlin. The seat is currently held by Trustee Lola Brooks who is not seeking re-election. Bywaters serves as the president of the Las Vegas Alliance of Black School Educators, as the education chair of the National Action Network, Las Vegas Chapter, and as a subcommittee member of the Nevada Office of Minority Health and Equity’s Black Leadership Advisory Council.

Washoe County School Board District A Christine Hull, a former teacher who works as the program director for the Nevada Center for Civic Engagement, which focuses on bringing civics and history education to K-12 classrooms, is on track to unseat Trustee Jeff Church, according to preliminary election results. Church joined the board in 2021 and represents District A, which includes the south and southeast Reno and Incline Village. Church — a controversial, conservative figure on the board — was nearly censured in 2021, the year he joined the board, for possible board policy violations; the board recentlyallocated $500,000to defend the district against Church’s “pattern of predatory litigation.” He was supported byBeadles. District D Beth Smith is on track to win her five-way race outright and retain her seat as the representative of District D, which includes central Reno. Smith was appointed to the board in 2021, and serves as the board’s president. One of her challengers included Christopher Tabarez. Beadles’ PAC sent out mailers on Tabarez’s behalf depicting Smith, a cancer survivor, as the grim reaper.Tabarez deniedbeing involved with the mailer.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/brown-wins-primary-to-face-rosen-lombardo-backed-composer-loses-race-to-challenge-lee,True,"Army veteran Sam Brown won the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, giving national Republicans their preferred choice for GOP nominee in a marquee race that could determine control of the upper chamber. He will face Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a one-term incumbent who easily won her primary Tuesday, in a race that political analysts project as a toss-up. With Democrats sure to lose retiring Sen. Joe Manchin’s (D-WV) seat and defending a whopping seven seats in red or swing states this cycle, a loss in Nevada would all but guarantee a Republican majority in the Senate. Republican primary voters in Nevada’s three Las Vegas-based House districts — each currently represented by Democrats — also selected a former North Las Vegas mayor, a candidate who lost a nailbiter Clark County Commission race last cycle and the same candidate who faced off with Rep. Dina Titus two years ago to challenge those incumbents. Only one of two candidates backed by popular Gov. Joe Lombardo (R-NV) prevailed. Political analystsfavoreach of the House Democrats to hang on to their seats. They expect Congressional District 3 Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) to have the closest race, but a wealthy video game composer backed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo came in fourth. But the Senate race will be the biggest and most expensive non-presidential election in the state. Brown wins Senate nomination Brown, who previously mounted an underdog bid in the 2022 Senate primary but ultimately lost to former Attorney General Adam Laxalt, was the preferred candidate this time around by the Republican political establishment in Nevada and D.C. He had the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), and was endorsed Lombardo. Brown got the biggest endorsement in Republican politics — astamp of approvalfrom former President Donald Trump — with two days to go until Election Day and most ballots already cast. While Trump kept voters waiting — declining to endorse during anhourlong rallyin Las Vegas on Sunday — he ultimately gave Brown the go-ahead Sunday night on Truth Social, praising his military background and comeback from a combat injury that left him with severe burns. With a fundraising advantage and front-runner status, Brown spent most of the primary focused on the general, skipping primary debates and targeting his messaging strategy on Rosen and President Joe Biden. His primary opponents, meanwhile, attacked him relentlessly — particularly Jeff Gunter, a dermatologist and former ambassador to Iceland. Gunter referred to Brown as a Republican in Name Only and “swamp creature” in advertisements and posts, ranmultipleadscriticizing Brown — including onunearthed 2022 commentsin which he expressed openness to storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. Another opponent, retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Tony Grady, accused Brown of “waffling” on Yucca, creating graphics and videos of Brown on aplate of waffles. But for all of the attacks, Brown never engaged with his opponents — even when his wife, Amy, wasoffendedby a Gunter ad she said digitally emphasized the scars he received from a roadside bomb explosion in Afghanistan that left him severely burned and forced him to medically retire from the military. It was a tactic borne out by his internal polling, whichcontinually found him leading by significant marginsand suggested Gunter’s ads were repelling as many voters as they were attracting. And while Gunter spent more than $2 million in advertising, per AdImpact, Brown committed only $621,000, and only aired positive ads. His associated political action committee, Duty First Nevada PAC,emptiedmore of its coffers — $918,000, including airing an attack ad on Gunter. Brown was also boosted by Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity Action, which dropped more than $400,000 on ads supporting him. That strategy paid off. As of 10:45 p.m. on Tuesday, Brown won nearly 60 percent of the vote, beating second-place Gunter by more than 40 points. He won every county — and was particularly strong in Washoe County, where he lives. Former Assemblyman Jim Marchant (R-Las Vegas), a nominee for secretary of state last cycle, finished a distant third with just less than 7 percent of the vote. At a Tuesday victory party at a Reno hotel, Brown thanked his parents for “raising him to be a man who’s not afraid of anything.” Victory party attendee Scott McKinley, 70, said that he’s “excited for Sam Brown” and noted that he’s “focused on the mission and his objectives, which are border security, the economy, and making sure that every layer of Americans are taken care of.” In an interview Monday, when asked what made him the best candidate in the primary, Brown only discussed his general election opponent. “I can just tell you what I'm about, and it's a clear contrast from Jacky Rosen,” he said. The greatest acknowledgment Brown’s campaign gave that he was competing in a primary at all was his increasing friendliness to Trump as the election neared. While Brown was more hesitant about the former president when he first announced his candidacy nearly a year ago,not endorsing himupon launch, he eventuallyendorsedTrump shortly before the Iowa caucus in January. He frequently referenced volunteering for Trump’s campaign in 2020, and he went to Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lagoin Aprilto try to personally appeal to the former president. After a last-minute wooing campaign from Brown and Gunter — NRSC chairman Steve DainescalledTrump twice last week on Brown’s behalf, while Gunter spoke to the former president at a fundraiser last weekend hosted by their mutual benefactor Don Ahern — Trump backed Brown. “Sam has already proven his Love for our Country, being horrifically wounded, and making the Comeback of a Lifetime,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Sam Brown has my Complete and Total Endorsement – HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” Brown’s orbit is already focused on the general election. Duty First Nevada PAC, a super PAC supporting the GOP nominee, released a30-second adTuesday evening highlighting Brown’s military service. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) launched a minute-longdigital adimmediately after the race was called for Brown, attacking him on abortion, Medicare, Social Security and his past Yucca Mountain stance. House primaries In the House primaries, one of two Lombardo-backed candidates prevailed and outside Republican groups’ hopes that independently wealthy candidates would win in primaries were dashed. Mark Robertson, Drew Johnson and John Lee will now face Reps. Dina Titus (D-NV), Susie Lee (D-NV) and Steven Horsford (D-NV), respectively, in November, a trio of Las Vegas-based representatives who have proven difficult to defeat. Even after redistricting in 2022 gave each district narrow Democratic majorities, making all of them potential pickups for Republicans, they were able to beat back challengers last cycle despite a wave of outside spending. Given the diminishing returns last cycle and a battleground map focused on seats in the expensive media markets of New York City and Los Angeles, the Republican challengers had less support from outside groups thus far this cycle than their counterparts in 2022. With national Republican groups hesitant to spend in Las Vegas, their hopes rested on self-funders prevailing in the primaries. But they did not get their wish — self-funders in CD1 and CD3 lost, leaving a likely financing gap between the Republican challengers and the Democratic incumbents who benefit from significant outside spending on their behalf and the power of Democratic small-dollar digital fundraising. Lee, whose 4 percentage point victory in 2022 left her with the closest margin, has awar chestof more than $2 million to take on Johnson. Johnson loaned his campaign $200,000, but he had been competing against video game composer Marty O’Donnell, who had put $500,000 into his run, and former treasurer Dan Schwartz, who loaned his campaign $800,000. On a night when Lombardo-backed candidates performed well in state legislative primaries, Congressional District 3 proved a rare miss. O’Donnell had been recruited and endorsed by Lombardo and was working with the same consulting team that powered his 2022 victory. But by the end of Election Day, he stood in fourth behind Johnson, Schwartz and former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien. As Election Day votes trickled in Tuesday night, Johnson had won nearly one-third of the vote, with no other candidate surpassing 23 percent. And in CD1, voters will get a rematch between Rep. Dina Titus and 2022 candidate Mark Robertson. Robertson was significantly outspent by independently wealthy restaurateur Flemming Larsen, who had $1.5 million on hand at the end of March to Robertson’s sum of less than $92,000. But Robertson led Larsen by 10 points at the end of Election Day. In Congressional District 4, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) will face former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, a Democrat turned Republican who received endorsements from Trump and Lombardo. He defeated veteran David Flippo by nearly 10 points as of Tuesday night. Of the three Republican challengers, Lee is the only one to have held elected office and comes with the most institutional support. In 2022, Horsford defeated his Republican challenger by about 5 percentage points. Meanwhile, Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) coasted to an easy victory over primary challenger Fred Simon in the Northern Nevada-based Congressional District 2. He has not drawn a Democratic opponent this cycle, and instead will face independent Greg Kidd. Amodei has won every election he’s been in — primary and general — since he first ran for the seat in 2011. Reporter Kelsea Frobes contributed to this story",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/legislative-elections-lombardos-picks-win-culinary-dem-establishment-have-mixed-night,True,"Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has a lot to lose when it comes to legislative races — his power to veto bills hinges on not losing a single seat to Democrats in the general election. But if Tuesday’s results are any indication, there’s reason to believe he has a fighting chance to fend off a Democratic supermajority. All of his endorsed legislative candidates prevailed in their primaries, meaning the table is set his way heading toward November. On the Democratic side, the top storyline was the mixed results of the Culinary Union, the politically influential hospitality workers union that turned heads this cycle by un-endorsing all candidates who voted against one of the union’s top priority bills in the 2023 legislative session. Though the union saw success in Las Vegas’ Assembly District 17,an open seat,  it failed in its ambitious quest to unseat Sen. Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas). In addition, two of the Assembly Democratic Caucus’ preferred candidates lost on Tuesday, though both of those districts are heavily Democratic, meaning the results will likely have no effect on the partisan makeup of the Assembly. In two other notable races in North Las Vegas, Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) fought off opposition from city officials and the cloud of an FBI investigation to easily defeat higher education Regent Laura Perkins. In the city’s other Senate seat, Senate District 1, Michelee “Shelly” Cruz-Crawford defeated Assemblywoman Clara Thomas (D-North Las Vegas). Lombardo-backed legislative candidates prevail In the seven competitive legislative primaries where Lombardo endorsed and supported candidates, all of his backed candidates handily won their races. In placing his thumb on the scale, Lombardo calculated that his endorsement and support would make a difference in legislative primaries, and it paid off for the governor, though November’s general election will determine whether he maintains his veto power. “I’m excited about this evening’s resounding primary victories,” Lombardo said in a statement. “Some really good candidates emerged tonight that are committed to a shared, common-sense agenda focused on lowering costs for Nevada families, adding choice and accountability to our education system, and restoring balance in state government.” Here’s a quick breakdown of the details of those seven races: Culinary Union has up-and-down night The primaries were a test of the Culinary Union’s political power — and the results were varied. The union — which represents 60,000 members across the state and has been a key driver of Democratic victories in the past — handpicked two candidates running against Democratic establishment picks in Senate District 3 and Assembly District 17. In Senate District 3, Nguyen defeated nurse practitioner Geoconda Hughes, a political newcomer who is the daughter of Culinary’s former Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Argüello-Kline. Throughout Tuesday evening, Nguyen maintained a double-digit lead over Hughes. The uniontargetedNguyen after she supportedSB441, a bill that ended pandemic-imposed requirements placed on the gaming industry,including daily hotel room cleaning. After the legislative session, the union secured daily room cleaning requirements as part of itsfive-year contractswith major Las Vegas resorts. Two months after picking Hughes to take on Nguyen, the union went a step further by un-endorsing 17 incumbents running for re-election who had also voted for the hotel room cleaning bill. It is unclear exactly how much money the union spent to unseat Nguyen because campaign donations since April will not be publicly available until mid-July. However, in Assembly District 17, the union’s pick — union leader and food server Linda Hunt — prevailed over Assembly Democratic Caucus pick Mishon Montgomery, an Air Force veteran and motivational speaker. In the early returns, Hunt had received about two-thirds of the vote. “Building power for workers isn’t about one election or one cycle but a long-term commitment, and for 89 years, win or lose, the Culinary Union has fought for workers’ rights to be heard and respected in this community, and we shall continue,” the union said in a statement Tuesday. Democratic establishment-backed candidates mostly succeed Out of the seven races where Democratic establishment-backed candidates faced challengers, only two were defeated. In addition to Hunt's victory over Montgomery in Assembly District 17, community organizer Heather Goulding defeated caucus-backed lawyer Alex Velto in Assembly District 27. Goulding’s win in the Northern Nevada district hints at the Assembly Democratic Caucus' weakness in the region. She is the third Democratic Assembly candidate in Northern Nevada since 2018 to win an initial bid for office without the support of the Assembly Democratic Caucus. However, in Senate District 15, Senate Democratic Caucus-backed Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno) defeated Reno City Councilwoman Naomi Duerr in the Democratic primary. Taylor will face Mike Ginsburg, a first-time candidate and former NV Energy manager, in the  general election. The four other races that saw Democratic Caucus-backed incumbents win were Senate District 1, where Cruz-Crawford won, Senate District 5, where Atlas defeated Christian Bishop, Senate District 4, where Neal successfully defended her seat against Perkins, and Nguyen in Senate District 3.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/berkley-seaman-headed-to-a-general-election-run-off-for-las-vegas-mayor,True,"Former Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-Las Vegas) and Las Vegas City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman said Tuesday’s primary results were exactly what they expected. Based on results from the state’s early voting period and initial return from Tuesday, Berkley held a nearly 4,000-vote lead over Seaman, with both well ahead in a field of 15 candidates. Las Vegas City Councilman Cedric Crear trailed Seaman by roughly 6,000 votes and was 10,000 votes behind Berkley. Now, the two women can focus on each other, which both said they had expected once the primary election was completed. “A campaign is a campaign, and I’m looking forward to it,” Berkley said during an election night party at her home in Queensridge. “I'll take the rest of the week off and then just roll up my sleeves and get started again.” Seaman, greeting supporters during a campaign party at the Las Vegas restaurant Paymon’s, said there is a “clear and concise difference” between her and Berkley. “I've been endorsed by the largest police association in Nevada, and I will be the law and order mayor,” Seaman said. “The real issue is we don't want to end up like our neighboring cities because of far-left liberal policies. We want to make sure that public safety stays number one.” Berkley, who spent 14 years as a Democratic congresswoman representing Las Vegas, said the mayor’s office is nonpartisan and she plans to govern in that manner. She cited her bipartisan work in Congress in getting the first Southern Nevada veteran’s hospital approved. “George W. Bush was president, there was a Republican veterans secretary and at least one of the houses of Congress was Republican,” Berkley said. “I was able to accomplish this with a Republican administration. Why? Because people were rational and reasonable. I'm not sure that we could get that accomplished today.” Berkley and Seaman each said they would work to settle the city’s long-running land-use dispute surrounding the defunct Badlands golf course. “I’ve spent the last five years trying to bring everyone together to make sure that this gets settled,” Seaman said. “When I'm mayor, there will be no one else that was on the council or in the planning commission when we got into Badlands. I believe that we can get in the room and settle it.” Berkley said her record in Congress shows she can work with both representatives of both parties. “I’ve tried very hard to keep this nonpartisan,” Berkley said. “It doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat. If you have a pothole that needs fixing. You want it fixed. It matters what my standard is when it comes to the issues that affect Las Vegas.” Although she would welcome an endorsement for former President Donald Trump, Seaman said she didn’t believe it would alienate any voters. “I’ve handled over 4,000 issues that came to my office,” she said. “I think people know that I'm there to serve the public and it's not about party and it's not about alienating anyone.”",Error: Connection error.

Reese was appointed to the at-large city council seat in 2019 and was elected to a full term in 2020.

Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas), an attorney and former assemblywoman, beat back a serious primary challenge from Culinary-backed nurse Geoconda Hughes to win her first race as a senator after she was appointed to the Senate District 3 seat in 2022. The win marks a blow to the Culinary Union, which backed Hughes andtargetedNguyen after she supportedSB441, a bill that removed pandemic-imposed requirements placed on the gaming industry,including daily hotel room cleaning. Leading up to the primary, state lawmakers publicly rallied around Nguyen. Her supporters also comprise an alliance of groups that often don’t agree, including the gaming industry and the trial lawyers, both of which contributed to Nguyen during the first quarter. Though the race was seen as a test of the Culinary Union's power, Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in mid-May, “We don’t look at it that way at all,” emphasizing that the election was an attempt to hold lawmakers accountable. Nguyen will face Republican Brent Howard in the general election in the solidly Democratic district. Berkley and Seaman advance to general election for Las Vegas Mayor’s race - 10:40 p.m. Former U.S. Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV) and Las Vegas City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman have advanced to a November runoff in the race for Las Vegas mayor. Berkley appeared to have the most votes based on early returns, followed by Seaman and with City Councilman Cedric Crear in a distant third. Because no candidate received more than 50 percent, the top two candidates are advancing to a general election runoff. Berkley’s candidacy marks her return to Nevada politics a dozen years after losing a high-profile bid for U.S. Senate that ended her 14-year career in Congress. Seaman is a former assemblywoman who has represented Ward 2 on the city council since 2019. Seaman is a Republican, while Berkley and Crear are Democrats. This is the first Las Vegas mayoral race to not feature a member of the Goodman family in 25 years. Lee wins Congressional District 4 GOP primary - 10:38 p.m. Former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee has won the Republican primary for Congressional District 4, setting up a general election matchup against Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV). Lee led North Las Vegas, the district’s population anchor, for more than nine years after serving in the Nevada Legislature. He was a Democrat for most of that time, switching parties in 2021 before a run for governor. With the endorsements of both Lombardo and Trump, Lee had both the national and local GOP apparatus behind him. The district has remained in Democratic hands since 2016, with Republicans only winning it once in the 2014 midterm election. Robertson wins Congressional District 1 GOP primary, setting up rematch with Titus-10:36 p.m. Army veteran Mark Robertson won the Republican primary for Congressional District 1, setting up a rematch of the 2022 contest when he lost to Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV). Robertson wassignificantly outspentby restaurateur Flemming Larsen through the end of the first quarter, but had the advantage of name recognition as the 2022 nominee. In 2022, he lost to Titus by about 6 percentage points. On his campaign website, he noted that Titus’ victory was powered by mail-in ballots, and thenfalsely assertedthat up to 20 percent of mail ballots were cast illegally. To win this time around, he said he will embrace early and mail voting and increase his outreach to nonpartisan voters and registered Republicans who did not vote in 2022. Neither Trump nor Lombardo weighed in on the primary. Johnson wins Congressional District 3 GOP primary - 10:34 p.m. Tax analyst Drew Johnson will win the Republican primary for Congressional District 3, beating a Lombardo-endorsed opponent and former elected official en route to becoming the GOP’s nominee. Johnson, who was endorsed by three members of Congress, three Republican state senators and a handful of other elected officials in Nevada, has never held elected office. He previously ran for Clark County Commission, narrowly losing to Democratic Commissioner Justin Jones by a margin of under 350 votes. A longtime fixture in conservative think tanks, Johnson loaned his campaign $200,000, but was still well behind wealthy opponents Marty O’Donnell, a video game composer, and Dan Schwartz, a former state treasurer. The latter two loaned their campaigns $500,000 and $800,000, respectively, but Johnson was still able to win the primary. Berkbigler wins Washoe County Commission District 1 Republican Primary - 10:09 p.m. Marsha Berkbigler defeated two other candidates in the Washoe County Commission District 1 Republican primary. She will face off against Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill in the November general election, after Hill defeated Berkbigler  in 2020. Berkbigler previously served eight years on the commission. Berkbigler is the only commission candidate prominent GOP donor and election conspiracy theorist Robert Beadles has donated money to this cycle. She toldThe Nevada Independentshe has no personal connection to Beadles but was aware of the campaign donation. Berkbigler also said she does not support Beadles’ election fraud claims. Andriola wins Washoe County Commission District 4 Republican Primary- 10:09 p.m. Washoe County Commissioner Clara Andriola emerged as the winner of the six-way Republican contest for Washoe County Commission District 4, and will advance as a heavy favorite over two nonpartisan candidates in the general election. Andriola was appointed to the seat by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, and previously served as the Reno Rodeo Foundation executive director. Andriola won the election despite being targeted by election skeptic and wealthy far-right activist Robert Beadles. Andriola split with the other two Republicans on the board on a number of contentious commission votes, including supporting Democrat Alexis Hill as chair of the commission and not supporting the restoration of a public comment period before commission meetings. Knudsen wins Las Vegas City Council Ward 1 race - 9:42 p.m. Councilman Brian Knudsen has retained the Ward 1 seat that he has held since his successful election in 2019. During the campaign, Knudsen, who worked for the city and various non-profits before becoming a councilman, faced candidates Miriam Gibson, a real estate broker, and Dennis Chairez. Because Knudsen received more than 50 percent of the vote, he wins outright and there will be no general election for the Ward 1 seat. Diaz wins Las Vegas City Council Ward 3 - 9:42 p.m. Councilwoman Olivia Diaz, a former lawmaker who previously worked as an elementary school teacher, has emerged as the winner of the Ward 3 Las Vegas City Council race, retaining the seat she has held since 2019. Diaz campaigned against candidates David Gomez, a business consultant, and Melissa Clary, who has experience in government and non-profit work. Following her successful re-election bid, Diaz’s seat will be up for election again in 2028. Bilbray-Axelrod, Becker advance in Clark County Commission District C race - 9:42 p.m. Democrat Shannon Bilbray-Axelrod and Republican April Becker have advanced to the general election for a Clark County Commission seat. Bilbray-Axelrod is a four-term assemblywoman who left her seat to run for a county commission position, and Becker ran an unsuccessful campaign against Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) in the 2022 general election. Bilbray-Axelrod beat Hunter Cain, a nonprofit founder, and Becker beat runner-up Thomas “Wags” Wagner, an insurance broker, in the crowded District C race that gained attention after incumbent Democrat Ross Miller announced he wasn’t going to run for re-election. Culinary-backed Hunt beats Montgomery in Assembly District 17 primary - 9:01 p.m. In North Las Vegas’ reliably blue Assembly District 17, Culinary Union-backed Linda Hunt defeated the Assembly Democratic Caucus’ pick, Mishon Montgomery. The seat, which encompasses Nellis Air Force base, is open after Assemblywoman Claire Thomas (D-North Las Vegas) opted to run for the open Senate District 1 seat. Hunt will face Republican Robert Olson in the general election. Dawson Owens wins Assembly District 29 Republican Primary - 8:45 p.m. Lombardo-backed Republican Annette Dawson Owens won the Assembly District 29 GOP primary, which is open after Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen (D-Henderson) announced she would not run for re-election.

Flanagan wins Assembly District 7 seat - 8:45 p.m. Democrat Tanya Flanagan defeated James Melvin Fennell in Southern Nevada’s Assembly District 7. Flanagan, a public information administrator for Clark County who was backed by the Assembly Democratic Caucus, is set to be the next representative of the district because no Republicans filed to run for the seat. The seat is open after former Assemblyman Cameron “C.H.” Millerresignedto seek the Las Vegas City Council seat held by Cedric Crear, who is running for mayor. Arroyo wins Assembly District 41 Republican Primary - 8:45 p.m. Rafael Arroyo, Lombardo’s endorsed candidate, defeated Guadalupe Reyes in Southern Nevada’s Assembly District 41, which includes portions of the Henderson airport and Silverado Ranch. Arroyo will face Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) in the November general election. Taylor defeats Duerr in Senate District 15 Democratic primary - 8:30 p.m. In Northern Nevada’s Senate District 15, Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno) defeated Reno City Councilwoman Naomi Duerr. The two Democrats, both with deep experience in local government, competed to run for the seat occupied by Sen. Heidi Seevers Gansert (R-Reno), whoannounced in Augustthat she would not run for re-election. Taylor will face whoever emerges as the winner of the district’s Republican primary in the general election. Following redistricting in 2021, the swing district became more favorable to Democrats. Ellison wins Senate District 19 primary - 8:29 p.m. Former Assemblyman John Ellison defeated his two other competitors to represent the ruby-red Senate District 19. He is all but guaranteed to represent the district in the 2025 legislative session because no Democrat filed. Endorsed by Gov. Joe Lombardo, Ellison defeated William Hockstedler, an Army and Air Force veteran who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2022, and Chelsy Fischer, a Nye County School Board trustee. The district covers a vast swath of rural Nevada, including Lincoln and White Pine counties and parts of Clark, Elko, Eureka and Nye counties. Steinbeck wins Senate District 18 Republican primary - 8:27 p.m. In swingy Senate District 18, Gov. Joe Lombardo-endorsed Clark County Fire Chief John Steinbeck emerged as the winner of the three-way Republican primary that included Assemblyman Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas) and businessman Josh Leavitt. The northwest Las Vegas Senate seat, which leans slightly in favor of Republicans, is open after Sen. Scott Hammond (R-Las Vegas) resigned last year because he accepted a job as executive director of the Nevada Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation. He will face Democrat Ron Bilodeau, who emerged as the winner in the Senate District 18 Democratic primary, in the general election. Neal defeats challenger in Senate District 4 primary - 8:23 p.m. Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) successfully defended her seat against Nevada System of Higher Education Regent Laura Perkins. Neal was an assemblywoman from 2010 to 2020 and has since represented Senate District 4, the same seat that her father, the late Sen. Joe Neal, held for nearly 30 years. Neal won despite top North Las Vegas officials backing Perkins following feuds between Neal and the city council. Nealaccused officialsof committing perjury during a committee hearing on since-abandoned plans to buy land that housed the now-demolished Texas Station casino. She alsosparredwith city officials over a bill regarding a city charter committee. With no challengers from another party, Neal is virtually guaranteed to return to the 2025 legislative session. Atlas defeats Bishop in Senate District 5-8:23 p.m. In swingy Senate District 5, which covers parts of Henderson and Paradise, establishment-backed former lobbyist Jennifer Atlas defeated challenger Christian Bishop. Atlas will face Sen. Carrie Buck (R-Henderson) in the November general election. The swing district has a fairly even split of registered Democratic (about 29 percent) and Republican voters (almost 30 percent), with the highest percentage of voters registered as nonpartisans (nearly 34 percent). It’s one of the few districts Democrats hope to flip blue this election cycle. Congressional District 2 - 8:17 p.m. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) easily survived a primary challenge to secure the Republican nomination for Congressional District 2. Amodei, who has represented Northern Nevada for seven terms, defeated trauma surgeon Fred Simon in the primary. Simon had previously run in the GOP primary for governor in 2022, receiving 3 percent of the vote. The longtime congressman will not face a Democratic opponent in the general election in the safe Republican district. Instead, he will take on businessman Greg Kidd, who is running as a nonpartisan. Kidd has loaned over $500,000 to his campaign thus far. Amodei won the general election in 2022 by 22 percentage points. Brown wins Republican U.S. Senate race - 8:12 p.m. Republicans got the candidate they wanted to take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV). Army veteran Sam Brown, the preferred choice of the GOP establishment in both D.C. and Nevada, will win Tuesday’s Republican primary for U.S. Senate, according to a race call made byThe Nevada Independent. He will now take on Rosen in the general election in a race that political analysts have marked a “toss-up” and that, if he wins, will all but guarantee Republican control of the Senate. Brown, who previously ran in the 2022 primary but lost to eventual nominee Adam Laxalt, overcame a field of challengers, including former Trump Ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter and former Assemblyman Jim Marchant (R-Las Vegas). Brown was boosted by a late-game endorsement from former President Donald Trump, who had held off on weighing in until Sunday night but then urged supporters to back him. In an interview Monday, Brown said he does not plan to change his message now that he’s in the general election and competing for votes from nonpartisans and Democrats in addition to Republicans. “It's not a partisan message,” Brown said. “It's a message for all Nevadans and people who have become concerned or disenfranchised with what our representation looks like in D.C. from Jacky Rosen and Joe Biden.” Democratic incumbents easily win - 8:12 p.m. Democratic congressional incumbents easily won their primaries Tuesday night. None faced serious challenges. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) will be the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate,defeatinga perennial candidate who lived in California. In the House, Reps. Susie Lee (D-NV) and Steven Horsford (D-NV) also cruised to victory. Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), in Congressional District 1, did not face a primary challenger.",Error: Connection error.

We’ll be updating this story throughout the day with dispatches from various polling sites, details on turnout and any election administration matters that emerge. You can find full election results on ourPrimary Results page, andfollow the team on Twitterfor the latest news and updates. Final vote tally: 68,000 Election Day votes Nearly68,000 Nevadanscast votes in person on Election Day, bringing voter turnout in the primary to around 16 percent. The final in-person count means that more than three times as many people voted early — either in person or by mail — than on Election Day. On Tuesday, more than half of the in-person voters cast ballots after 2 p.m., with Republicans more than doubling the number of Democratic voters. — Eric Neugeboren, 10 p.m. Polls close Polls have closed in Nevada’s primary election, but voters who are still in line are able to vote. Election results are expected to start being released shortly after the final voter in line casts a ballot. As of 7:10 p.m., more than 42,000 Clark County residents had voted in person on Election Day. — Eric Neugeboren, 7:10 p.m. 33,000 Election Day in-person votes cast as of 2 p.m. As of 2 p.m. Tuesday, nearly33,500 Nevadanshad cast ballots in person on Election Day, with Republicans making up the vast majority of in-person votes. Only around 2,700 nonpartisans had voted on Tuesday as of 2 p.m. Nonpartisans make up the largest share of registered voters but cannot vote in many of Tuesday’s primaries because most races are only for Democratic or Republican voters. In Clark County, more than 20,000 residents had voted as of 2 p.m., with Republicans outnumbering Democrats by roughly 6,000 and around 1,800 nonpartisans voting. The total turnout is significantly less than the number ofearly votes cast, with more than 250,000 people voting early by mail or in person. Democrats had a slight advantage in early voting turnout. In theFebruary presidential primary, around 12,000 people had voted in person on Election Day as of 2 p.m. — Eric Neugeboren, 7:10 p.m. PHOTOS: Voters cast ballots at Desert Breeze Community Center in Las Vegas —Jeff Scheid, 2:55 p.m. How to participate in the 2024 Nevada primary election — Rocio Hernandez, 10:40 a.m. Polls now open, but many ballots already cast Primary Election Day voting centers opened at 7 a.m. across the state, allowing those who did not participate during early voting to cast their ballots. As ofMonday morning, about 238,400 Nevadans had cast a ballot in the primary via mail or in-person voting, bringing the total voter turnout to 11.9 percent. So far, more than 72 percent of all voters who have cast a ballot have done so by mail, including nearly 80 percent of Democrats and about 61 percent of Republicans. Though turnout has been low so far, 44.5 percent of voters who cast a ballot were Democrats, and 41.3 percent were Republicans. Other party registrations accounted for 14.3 percent of the total turnout. To speed up the process of reporting results, the secretary of state issued new guidance allowing counties to start tabulating ballots as early as 8 a.m. today. During previous elections, counties could only begin counting ballots after the polls closed. Though tabulation begins this morning, unofficial results will not begin posting until all polls are closed and the last voter in line anywhere in the state has cast their ballot.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/republican-challengers-legislative-showdowns-what-to-watch-as-nevadans-head-to-the-polls,True,"Nevada’s primary election will set the stage for November’s battle for party control of a U.S. Senate seat in a purple state, the governor’s veto power over the Legislature, the next mayor of Nevada’s largest city and school board seats that could allow outside groups to shape the curriculum. Fewer than 12 percent of registered voters have cast their ballots early, and fewer than 30 percent of them voted in person, according todatafrom the secretary of state’s office. Election officials said in early May that they expected mail voting to continue to grow in popularity this year, which may affect how Clark County allocates in-person election workers in the future. Staff atThe Nevada Independentexplain the trends and races that we’re watching in the primary and what the results could mean for the November general election. Who will win the GOP Senate primary? The Republican U.S. Senate primary pits Army veteran Sam Brown against a field of lesser-funded challengers in the race to take on vulnerable Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV). If a Republican flips the seat, the GOP is essentially guaranteed control of the U.S. Senate — a majority that has eluded it since 2020. Brown, who mounted an unsuccessful bid against eventual nominee and former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt in 2022, is running this time with the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, several sitting senators and well-funded outside groups. His biggest challenger is Jeff Gunter, a dermatologist and former ambassador to Iceland during the Trump administration. Gunter, who is independently wealthy, has funded his own campaign and aired television ads that relentlessly attack Brown as being an establishment creature. Brown, however, has stayed above the primary fray, choosing only to criticize Rosen. In an interview Monday, he rejected an opportunity to compare himself to other Republicans in the race, saying his pitch to voters is centered on “a clear contrast from Jacky Rosen.” Gunter, meanwhile, has pitched himself as the more Trump-aligned candidate, despite losing out on his endorsement. But he argued that his longer tenure working in Nevada — 28 years running a dermatology practice in the state — and lack of support from the Republican establishment make him the better choice. He also said a frequent hit against him — that he was previously a registered Democrat — would boost his appeal with the nonpartisan voters critical to winning a general election. “I spent my entire life taking care of people and being able to work with them,” Gunter said, mentioning that he’s served patients of all political stripes. “I think it’ll be no different when I’m the U.S. Senator from Nevada…that message will resonate well with independent voters.” Other primary candidates include former Assemblyman Jim Marchant (R-Las Vegas) and Air Force veteran Tony Grady. Former President Donald TrumpendorsedBrown on Sunday. Before his announcement, Nevada had been the only competitive Senate race in which he had not weighed in during the primary. Will Lombardo’s favored candidate win the CD3 primary? The Republican Congressional District 3 primary — typically the most competitive general House race in the state — is dominated by several self-funded candidates vying to take on Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV). The field includes video game composer Marty O’Donnell, former state Treasurer Dan Schwartz, tax analyst Drew Johnson and former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien. O’Donnell has the endorsement of Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) and is working with the same consulting team that powered the governor’s 2022 victory. He’s loaned his campaign hundreds of thousands of dollars — as have Schwartz and Johnson. A first-time candidate, O’Donnellwould beone of the wealthiest members of Congress if elected. Schwartz has run in this district, for governor and for lieutenant governor since his term as treasurer ended, but never advanced through the primary. Who will win the CD4 primary? In Congressional District 4, former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee has the endorsements of Trump and Lombardo in his bid to win the Republican primary and take on Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), who has won his last three elections. Lee served as a Democrat in both chambers of the Nevada Legislature and for most of his two terms as mayor. He changed parties in 2021 before an unsuccessful run for governor in 2022. The other major candidate, retired Air Force lieutenant colonel David Flippo, has continually dinged Lee for not endorsing Trump until late May and for refusing to debate. Flippo is endorsed by five members of Congress and the last two Republican candidates for the seat, both of whom lost in the general election. Will the Culinary Union prevail in legislative races? The Democratic primaries in Southern Nevada’s Senate District 3 and Assembly District 17 are widely seen as a test of the Culinary Union’s power in legislative politics. The union — which represents 60,000 members across the state and is a politically powerful force in Nevada — is backing two candidates running against Democratic establishment picks. Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a May interview that the union backed Geoconda Hughes for Sen. Rochelle Nguyen’s (D-Las Vegas) Senate District 3 seat, and union leader and server Linda Hunt in Assembly District 17, as a way to offer voters “an opportunity to choose better Democrats.” Hughes is the daughter of former Culinary Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Argüello-Kline. Specifically, the uniontargetedNguyen after she supportedSB441, a bill that removed pandemic-imposed requirements placed on the gaming industry,including daily hotel room cleaning. The union made daily room cleaning part of thefive-year contract negotiationswith major Las Vegas resorts that began in earnest after the legislative session. What is the outcome of the three legislative races that will be decided in the primary? Three of the legislative seats up for election this cycle (two Senate seats and one Assembly seat) only drew candidates from one party. The outcome will determine who will be going to Carson City for the 2025 legislative session in the following districts: Will Lombardo-backed legislative candidates succeed in their primaries? Democrats already hold a 28-seat supermajority in the 42-member Assembly and are one seat shy of the 14 seats needed for a two-thirds supermajority in the 21-member state Senate — an outcome that would prove dire for the political relevance of Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. For Lombardo, maintaining his veto power rests entirely on Republicans not losing any more ground. Lombardo has endorsed and supported candidates with his campaign machinery. In placing his thumb on the scale, Lombardo has calculated that his endorsement and support will make a difference in legislative primaries — but we’ll have to wait until the general election to see if he maintains his veto power. Will Democratic establishment-backed candidates win in Northern Nevada’s legislative races? The outcome of the Assembly District 27 Democratic primary could signal how much sway the Assembly Democratic Caucus holds in Northern Nevada. Assembly Democratic Caucus-backed candidate Alex Velto, an attorney, is facing off against Heather Goulding, a senior project manager at an energy research and evaluation firm. In Senate District 15 Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno) is battling with Reno City Councilwoman Naomi Duerr for the seat that is open after Sen. Heidi Gansert (R-Reno) decided not to run for re-election. Who will prevail in the Las Vegas mayoral race? The race for Las Vegas mayor — the first in 25 years to not feature a member of the Goodman family — is widely seen as a contest between three candidates competing for two general election slots. The top two candidates will advance to the general election in November, as long as no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, which appears unlikely because more than a dozen candidates are running. Three candidates have outpaced the field in money raised: Former Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV), City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman and City Councilman Cedric Crear. Berkley has been away from office for a dozen years after losing a high-profile bid for U.S. Senate in 2012 that ended her 14-year career in Congress. Crear and Seaman, meanwhile, have served on the city council since 2018 and 2019, respectively. Though the mayoral position is nonpartisan, Seaman, a Republican, has openly appealed to GOP voters, while Crear and Berkley are Democrats. Who will win the Washoe County District 4 Commission Republican primary? Republican Clara Andriola, who was appointed to the Washoe County Commission by  Lombardo in April 2023, is now facing six challengers for her seat, including RepublicansTracey Hilton-Thomas,Trista Gomez,John L. Walter IIand Mark Lawson. Though Andriola has Lombardo’s support,election skepticand wealthyfar-right activist Robert Beadleshas targeted Andriola this election cycle. Beadles has prioritizedoverhauling public boards, including helping fund a campaign that successfully ousted a commission incumbent in the 2022 primary. Will Moms for Liberty influence the Clark County School Board elections? With only one Clark County school trustee running for re-election, there’s guaranteed to be a shake up on the board next year. Among the long list of contenders vying for the four seats up for grabs are candidates backed by the Moms for Liberty Clark County chapter thatformed last August: Other candidates include Board President Evelyn Garcia Morales (District C) as well as Anna Binder (District A), Russ Burns (District B), Kamilah Bywaters (District E) and Tameka Henry (District C), who are supported by local and statewideeducator unions, and Karl Catarata (District A), who has gotten support from state lawmakers including Assemblywoman Erica Mosca (D-Las Vegas).",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/john-lee-says-opponent-behind-website-labeling-him-sexual-predator-flippo-denies,True,"An anonymous websitelaunchedlast week accuses John Lee, a GOP candidate for Nevada’s 4th Congressional District, of being a “sexual predator” based on a 25-minute recording of a man arranging a sexual meetup with a woman and her 13-year-old daughter. On Monday, the eve of the GOP primary, Lee issued a press release accusing his top opponent, David Flippo, of being behind the “intentionally false and disgusting attacks,” though his campaign did not say exactly how it concluded that Flippo was personally involved. The campaign said the audio “is clearly not of John Lee.” Lee’s campaign filed alawsuitMonday in Clark County District Court and said it had turned over evidence to the Clark County District Attorney’s Office and FBI. Lee’s campaign alleged that the recording was either fabricated or generated using deepfake artificial intelligence, a method that digitally alters media to spread misinformation. In a statement on Monday, Rory McShane, the founder of McShane LLC, which is managing Flippo’s campaign, said the campaign had no role in the website. “The Flippo campaign was not involved in the publication of this website or recording in anyway, and went as far as to preemptively make the Lee campaign aware of its existence more than six months ago,” the statement said. In the lawsuit, Lee’s lawyers said that the audio file was discussed in a December meeting between both campaigns. They also alleged that a Clark County man named Lou Colagiovanni — listed as a defendant alongside Flippo and his campaign — offered the audio file to Flippo’s campaign in exchange for $20,000. Colagiovanni, a political blogger,helped reveala sex scandal involving former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY). Colagiovanni did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Although the lawsuit does not say whether that exact transaction ultimately occurred, it accuses Flippo and his campaign of using the audio file to defame and inflict emotional distress upon  Lee, costing him as much as $15,000 in damages as he retained legal counsel. “Defendants have created, published and otherwise used the Website to harm Mr. Lee in an attempt to bolster Flippo’s career and in his current campaign for Nevada Congressional District 4,” the lawsuit said. The website, which went live Wednesday, accused Lee of being a “deviant who seeks out incestuous relationships with mothers and their teenager daughters.” That is based on a 25-minute audio file, during which a man appears to be responding to a Craigslist ad seeking someone to have sex with a mother and her 13-year-old daughter. The last-minute political mudslinging comes one day before polls close for Nevada’s state primaries. Lee — a former Democratic state lawmaker, mayor of North Las Vegas and GOP gubernatorial candidate — and Flippo, a far-right Air Force veteran, are the top two candidates in the GOP race to take on Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV). Lee has received endorsements from former President Donald Trump and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-stays-out-of-senate-primary-in-vegas-rally-pans-biden-border-policy-as-bullshit,True,"Ahead of former President Donald Trump’s Las Vegas rally on Sunday, hereportedlyplanned to endorse a candidate in the state’s pivotal GOP primary on Tuesday for U.S. Senate. But instead, the former president used his hourlong, freewheeling speech to imitate President Joe Biden, read poetry, rebut a four-year-old magazine article and lament the state of the border dozens of times, punctuated by an inaccurate statement that every job created under Biden went to an undocumented immigrant. The rally, held amid a heat wave at Sunset Park in southern Las Vegas that resulted in six hospitalizations, marked Trump’s third visit to the Silver State this year and first sincehe was convictedof 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, becoming the first former president to be a convicted felon. Trump only alluded to the convictions in his first campaign-sponsored rally since the jury verdict was announced, criticizing Biden for weaponizing the Department of Justice andfalsely claimingthat the president had 10 times more classified documents in his possession than Trump did. Trump instead opened his speech with harsh criticism for Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), who he referred to as “your Biden-loving radical left senator.” He promised to defeat her, but, notably, did not tell the crowd of thousands whom to support just two days before the state’s primary election. Hours after the rally ended on Sunday evening, Trump formallyendorsedveteran Sam Brown on his Truth Social social media website. Brown is an Army veteran who haspersonally appealedto Trump and who has the National Republican Senatorial Committeeadvocatingon his behalf. The endorsement spells trouble for Jeff Gunter, a wealthy dermatologist and former ambassador to Iceland who is backed by one of Trump’s top donors in the state. Brown has had significant leads in fundraising and in the limited polling conducted in the race. At one point, Trump — in the midst of a rant about how the teleprompter stopped functioning as it had done at an Ohio rally— noted that both states’ Senate races featured a candidate with the last name Brown. “You have a good man named Brown right here,” Trump said. “They have a man [Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH)] that's not so good.” Trump spent the weekend in Nevada, attending a high-dollarfundraising dinnerSaturday night hosted by a group including Las Vegas businessman Don Ahern. Brown and Gunter attended the rally, and Gunter, whom Ahern is backing, was at the Saturday fundraiser and spoke with the former president, according to Gunter’s campaign. Instead, the most notable rally announcement came when Trump said he would call on Congress to end the taxation of tips as president. That pledge — likely to benefit hospitality workers and others in the service industry — was met with skepticism by the Culinary Workers Union, which represents 60,000 hospitality workers in Southern Nevada and has alreadycommittedto canvassing for Biden. “Relief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,” the union said in astatement. The heat Thousands of Trump devotees descended Sunday on the more than 300-acre park , an area with limited shade on a day where temperatures later hit triple digits. The rally was part of Trump’s stretch of events in the Southwest that included an outdoor rally in Phoenix where11 attendees were hospitalizedbecause of the heat. Hundreds of attendees left the main area of Trump’s rally during his speech, as the sun emerged after hours of cloud coverage. During the event, the Clark County Fire Department treated 24 people, and six people required transport to a hospital, according to a county spokesperson, who added that most, if not all, calls were related to heat. In addition, 97 people used cooling tents. Trump, 77, appeared unbothered by the weather — his first line was “it’s not too hot out here, right?” — and joked that his campaign was so concerned about attendees’ well-being that they did not consider his own. “Everybody was so worried yesterday about you, and they never mentioned me,” he said. “I’m up here sweating like a dog.” The rally setting prompted fierce condemnation from the environmental group Climate Power, an organization focused on electing politicians who support policies to address the effects of climate change. In a statement, Alex Glass, a spokesperson for the group said Trump is “making promises to Big Oil executives who are fueling the climate crisis while people are passing out at his rallies from very real, very dangerous heatwaves that he says are caused by a hoax.” Brenda Reeves, a 69-year-old Las Vegas wedding officiant, spent some time in the medical tent and said she is prone to overheating. But she said seeing Trump was worth it. This was her first time attending a Trump rally out of safety concerns for herself after the Jan. 6 insurrection, where she said Trump supporters “were framed.” Kris Waugh, 72, also retreated to a limited shade area during Trump’s speech. She arrived at the event at around 9 a.m. It was also her first time at a Trump event but said she was willing to go out in the heat for him. “He is the most honest man I’ve ever met,” she said. Immigration Between digressions about ISIS, sharks and a reading ofThe Snake, a poem he has used since 2016, the bulk of Trump’s speech focused on immigration. The issue was top of mind for Trump in the same week that Biden signed anexecutive ordershutting down new asylum requests if border crossings reach a certain threshold, a move that progressive groups panned as too extreme. Promising to “close the border” on the first day of his presidency, Trump drew contrasts between his and Biden’s border policies. Border crossing figures have beensignificantly higherthroughout Biden’s administration than Trump’s, though Trumpincorrectlyasserted that he presided over the “most secure border in the history of our country.” Calling the new policy “bullshit,” Trump said Biden’s action was little more than a “PR ploy” when he could reinstate Trump-era border policies if he were serious about the issue. The Biden administration does plan to use thesame legal defensethat the Trump administration frequently deployed to defend many of his border-focused executive orders. “Crooked Joe signed an executive order that is pro-invasion, pro child-trafficking, pro-woman trafficking, pro-human trafficking and pro-drug dealers,” Trump said. “It's weak. It's ineffective.” In a statement, Maca Casado, a Biden spokesperson for Hispanic media, criticized Trump’s remarks as disparaging against the immigrant community. Democrats have hammered Trump in recent days, with the Democratic National Committee launchingbillboardsin Las Vegas on Saturday, calling Trump a “convicted white-collar crook” and a “disaster for Nevada’s economy.” The progressive group Battle Born Progress also releasedtwo mobile billboardson Trump’s conviction and efforts to curtain abortion access. Rest of the speech Without a teleprompter — an absence he complained about frequently — Trump’s speech was full of long asides and anecdotes, including an extended refutation of a2020 articleinThe Atlanticasserting that he called Marines who died in World War I “losers” and “suckers,” a discussion of disliking the commercials on Fox News and a live poll of attendees on whether they preferred “Crooked Joe” or “Sleepy Joe” as a nickname for Biden (“Crooked” won handily). Trump spent much of his time launching personal attacks on Biden, painting him as an incompetent leader who frequently embarrasses the country and making fun of his gait and speech patterns through imitations. Trump, whose 78th birthday is next week and who told attendees singing him “Happy Birthday” that by a certain age “you just want to pretend the day doesn’t exist,” was careful not to ding Biden, 81, on his age. The president’s problem, he said, is unconnected to being an octogenarian. “He’s a corrupt, very dumb person,” Trump said of Biden. “He’s a low-IQ individual. If you go back 30 years ago, he was considered the dumbest person in the Senate.” Trump also suggested Biden should take a drug test before their scheduled televised debate on June 27, repeating aconspiracy theorythat the president’s performance at the State of the Union was artificially enhanced. Campaign surrogates speaking at the rally earlier in the day spoke of Trump in zealous terms. Firebrand right-wing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) compared Trump’s conviction to the persecution of Jesus Christ, while Nevada GOP Chairman Michael McDonald, who wasindictedby a grand jury over his role as a fake elector in 2020, framed the event in sacred terminology. “What more can be said than thank God we’re here, at Sunset Park, to worship and bring back the greatest president we’ve ever known in our generation,” McDonald said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/moms-critical-of-policies-books-related-to-lgbtq-students-seek-school-board-seats,True,"Christiane Mersch sees herself and other conservative, Christian parents as warriors. During a recent town hall at Henderson church, she recruited attendees into her fight. Their enemy: the Clark County School District (CCSD), more specifically books and policies within the district that they say are part of a conspiracy to encourage students to question their gender identities and sexualities. For the past nine months, Mersch, who serves as the chair of the local chapter of Moms for Liberty, a controversial national parental rights organization, and other members have pushed toremove bookswith LGBTQ+ themes from school libraries and revoke adistrict policythat’s part of a state law that’s meant to support students of diverse gender identities. Now, the group is looking to make headway in its crusade by supporting members and other candidates aligned with its mission who are looking to join the Clark County School Board and the State Board of Education: Vice Chair Lorena Biassotti, senior adviser Timothy Underwood, member Lydia Dominguez, charter school teacher Rachel Puaina and CCSD parent Frank Friends. “If we can vote for people that have common sense and have a new direction on the board, we can work together with the community for the success of our kids, focusing on academics, not indoctrination,” said Mersch, whose own children are not in the district’s schools but who sees herself as a stakeholder in the district because her taxes support it. Local education advocates have called out the chapter for its “hateful comments'' suggesting transgender individuals are mentally ill or disabled. One school board trustee referred to the chapter as a “cancer” that shouldn't be allowed to spread; others said they worry about what effect this movement will have on the mental health and safety of LGBTQ+ students in the district. “We need to wake up, because if we fall asleep, they’re going to come in like a swarm,” said trustee candidate Kamilah Bywaters, who has asked voters to support her in part to avoid Moms for Liberty-aligned candidates from gaining a foothold on the board. It’s the latest example of partisan views entering nonpartisan school board races in Nevada, but it’s byno means the first. Experts say schools have long been a battleground for social issues, from evolution and sex education to desegregation. Tuesday’s primary will be a test of whether the group can translate the waves it makes in school board meeting public comment periods into real political power. Mobilizing moms Moms for Libertywas founded in 2021 by three Florida moms and current and former school board members opposed to school closures, mask mandates and other COVID safety measures. Today, the organization says it has 130,000 members in 300 chapters across 48 states and has been linked to Republicans such as former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who both spoke at the organization’s2023 conference. As a 501(c)4 nonprofit, the organization isn’t required to disclose which donors helped it bring in its $2.1 million in revenue in 2022, butThe Associated Pressfound that theHeritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., andThe Leadership Institute, which has trained conservative politicians from former Vice President Mike Pence to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), have been donors or event sponsors. During the past three years, the organization has targeted curriculum around race, gender and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). This year, the national organization said it’sjoining lawsuitsagainstchanges to Title IX— a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities — that would clarify that gender identity is covered by laws prohibiting sex discrimination. Last week, national leaders announced they are looking to spend more than $3 million inadvertising targeting votersin presidential battleground states such as Nevada. As the organization’s platform has expanded, so too has the scrutiny about it. In 2023, the Southern Poverty Law Center labeled the Moms For Liberty as ananti-government extremist group. The organization had to remove two Kentucky chapter officials from their positions after they were linked to members of the far-right Proud Boys group, and it recently had to fend off asex scandaltied to one of its co-founders who’s no longer involved with the organization. But Moms for Liberty has also seen successes. Last year, the organization was credited for being part of efforts topush out superintendentsat nine of the 17 school districts where it managed to flip school boards. Moms for Liberty officially expanded into Clark County last August. The local chapter, which leaders said grew to 800 members last month, is led by Mersch, a Brazilian immigrant, and Biassotti, who’s currently running to be on the Clark County School Board. Mersch said prior to Moms for Liberty, she worked as a staff member at Women’s Resource Medical Center, and still serves as a board member of First Choice Pregnancy Services. Both are crisis pregnancy centers — organizations focused on deterring women from getting abortions but that critics say canconfuse consumerswho may think they are regulated medical facilities. Mersch said she’s also been involved in philanthropy, primarily fundraising money for nonprofit organizations fighting against sex trafficking and sex abuse, causes that she's passionate about as a survivor of sex trafficking. While she doesn't have kids in CCSD schools, Mersch said she became concerned about the state of education at the district after seeing how behind students who transferred to the private Christian elementary school where she teaches were in reading. Biassotti, who also goes by her maiden name, Cardenas, was a frequent protester at school board meetings during the pandemic fighting against the district’s school closures and mask mandates. She’s also the founder ofMy Children’s Advocate, an organization that, like Moms for Liberty, equates support and health care for transgender individuals to abuse and makes accusations online and at school board meetings that trans rights supporters are pedophiles and groomers. Biassotti said two of her children attend CCSD schools, and another two attend private Christian schools. But she said she doesn't think that all parents should have to move their children out of CCSD and into private schools to “protect them” from materials and policies they don’t agree with. “If you have to take your children to a private school, and pay a tuition on top of your tax-paid education … you’re paying twice as much,” Biassotti said. Mersch said regardless of whether chapter members have students in the district, they should, as taxpayers, all have a say in the district’s policies and what’s being taught to students. But she said speaking out is especially important for CCSD parents who she said have the right to protect their children. If the school board candidates the chapter is supporting succeed and are elected to the board, Mersch said she wants to see the board repeal policies related toschool librariesand support plans for students withdiverse gender identities.She said the chapter also wants more transparency around what’s being taught in CCSD schools. “Parents have the fundamental rights under our Constitution to guide and direct the education of their kids, and that means they need to be notified about these materials, and they need to have transparency about what the kids are being taught,” Mersch said. “They're hurting our parental rights right now when they try to hide.” Partisanship in K-12 public schools Political division in K-12 education spaces is nothing new, said University of Southern California education policy professor Julie Marsh. Past hot button K-12 education issues have included debates on the teaching of evolution and sex education. In the 1950s,school desegregationduring the civil rights movement drew angry mobs of white community members attempting to prevent Black students from integrating in previously all-white schools. Marsh said this latest wave of partisanship in school board elections mirrors the polarization at the national level that grew as Trump rose to power, and took further root during the pandemic. In recent years, Marsh has seen political figures such as Republican governors DeSantis and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who’s also allied with Moms for Liberty, use school culture war issues to energize their base. Marsh and other experts say that groups such as Moms for Liberty and politicians aligned with them have used parents’ frustrations about mask mandates and school closure as part of their effort to erode support for public schools and promote school vouchers, which direct state funds that would otherwise go to public schools to private schools. “That might be the ultimate goal — you do this fear mongering to drive parents out of public schools and build support for some of these other policies,” Marsh said. Book censorship One of the local chapter’s top goals includes removing books that contain themes of gender identity and sexuality from the CCSD school libraries that carry them. One of these books that the group points to during public comment periods at school board meetings isGender Queer,a memoir about the author, Maia Kobabe’s, journey to accepting Kobabe’s nonbinary and asexual identities. The book includes brief scenes that depict masturbation and oral sex. According to a public records request by the chapter to the district,Gender Queeris in eight high schools’ libraries. Chapter members and supporters have had their mics cut off while reading passages from the book containing explicit language. As a survivor of sexual assault, Mersch said these books remind her of the pornography that she was exposed to by her abuser. “When I see books like this, showing pornography to kids, it’s preparing their minds to be raped,” she said. American Libraries Association President Emily Drabinski, who identifies as a lesbian, pushed back against Mersch’s claim that books such asGender Queerthat deal with human sexuality are pornographic. Rather, she said it's a book with a positive message about being comfortable with who you are and can save the lives of youth who are struggling to find support and come to terms with their identities. “To reduce that book to the presence of a penis or the fact of masturbation … is insulting to the content and insulting to the librarians that chose the book for their readers,” Drabinski said. Mersch said that so far, the chapter’s attempts to remove books have been unsuccessful, meaning the books will stay in school libraries without any restrictions. “They decided to keep these inappropriate books in open shelves, the same books I can not read at school board meetings,” Mersch said in an emailed statement. Clark County school librarian Nichole Beer and Clark County School Board Trustee Lisa Guzman said they fear if the candidates backed by Moms for Liberty prevail in this election cycle, they will remove any books they perceive as being inappropriate, including books that touch on diverse identities. “To a reading specialist, any book that makes the child want to read is a good book,” Guzman said. The group’s presence and rhetoric toward LGBTQ+ communities at school board meetings have made Jenna Robertson, president and co-founder of Nevada Alliance for Student Diversity, and other parents of gay and transgender youth feel these spaces are no longer safe for their children. It led Robertson to keeping her teen daughter, who’s an advocate for student rights at school board meetings, from going in person. “She would love to go to these meetings and be heard more often,” she said. “I discourage her because I just don't think it's necessary to hear the things that are said in those meetings.” Two Clark County School Board trustees, Guzman and Linda Cavazos, have also raised concerns about the local chapter. In a Septemberpost on X(formerly known as Twitter), Cavazos called the group“a cancer”that shouldn’t be allowed to spread in the community. Earlier this month, Guzman, who’s not seeking re-election after her term concludes at the end of the year,wrote about the groupon X and said the candidates the chapter is backing “will hurt our children, not follow the law and take the district in the wrong direction.” School board candidates such as Matthew Tramp and Kamilah Bywaters, who are running in the nine-way District E race that includes Biassotti, have urged voters tosupport their campaignto keep Moms for Liberty candidates off the school board. The criticisms, which Mersch considers to be bullying, hasn’t deterred the chapter, and My Children’s Advocate has fired back atBywatersandother opponentson social media. Moms’ influence waning? The primary election will be the Clark County chapter’s first real test of how much success they’ve had in gathering support in Southern Nevada. Researchers at the Brookings Institute, a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, D.C., believe that the organization’s influence on a national level may be waning based on thewin rateof candidates backed by Moms for Liberty nationwide during the 2023 election cycle, 33 percent, compared with the 2022 cycle, 47 percent. With less than a year under its belt, Mersch said the chapter is still working on gathering momentum. Overt support from elected officials and more established groups has been mixed — Nevada System of Higher Education Regent Patrick Boylan attended the chapter’s town hall in April after members supported himamid backlashover comments he made against female trans athletes. Mersch said CCSD Trustee Katie Williams has also shown the group support, although Williams did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Local conservative state lawmakers, such as Assemblyman Toby Yurek (R-Henderson) and Sen. Carrie Buck (R-Henderson), either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment on the chapter. Power 2 Parent, an organization that supports school choice and parental rights and opposes certain sex education policies, said it’s not affiliated with the chapter. Contributions and expenses reports show none of the school board or state board candidates the chapter is supporting are the fundraising leaders in their respective races, except for Dominguez. Dominguez’s reportshows the District B candidate raised $2,700 in the first quarter of the year, but she loaned her campaign $2,000 of that amount. The seat is currently held by Williams, who is not running for re-election and who appointed Dominguez to the district’s Attendance Zoning Advisory Committee. Mersch remains focused on the chapter’s next steps. In addition to expanding the chapter’s membership, she hopes to take the fight to the state Legislature and push for legislation to expand parental rights in schools and allow certain books to be more easily removed from school libraries. “I just want parents to know they have the fundamental right to defend their right, not the government’s, to educate their children,” she said. “So I want to grow in all the communities that I can.”",Error: Connection error.

The party is activelypromotinga Trump campaign rally scheduled in Las Vegas this weekend and even went so far as toissue a statementdefending Trump after the conviction was announced. “The partisan farce that unfolded today can be described as nothing short of a radicalized campaign stunt born of a highly conflicted trial,” the statement said at the time. “We stand in complete support of President Donald J. Trump and resist the charges upheld in today’s judgment.” Article 16 of the state partybylawson the group’s website stipulates that the party “shall neither recognize nor support any candidate for public office who has been convicted of a felony or, while serving in a public office, was impeached and convicted or removed from office for any reason.” The article, however, includes a provision that the party can waive the rule with a two-thirds majority vote of members and delegates present at the GOP state convention or the Nevada Republican Central Committee (NRCC).

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rfk-jr-files-new-petition-to-land-on-nevada-ballot-earlier-effort-stuck-in-court,True,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s independent presidential campaign has filed a new petition with Nevada election officials to qualify for the November general election, after the candidate’s previous petition did not meet state requirements of including a vice presidential candidate on signature forms. The signature gathering deadline for independent presidential candidates is July 5, meaning the campaign has less than one month to gather at least 10,095 signatures before state officials can undertake a signature verification process. Thenew petitioncomes one week after the campaignfiled a federal lawsuitagainst Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, whose office determined that the campaign’s previous petition was likely invalid because it did not list a running mate. Kennedy is an environmental lawyer and nephew of John F. Kennedy who rose to prominence during the pandemic because of his anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. In an email on Thursday, Paul Rossi, the campaign’s ballot access attorney, submitted a revised petition that includes Kennedy’s vice presidential pick, lawyer Nicole Shanahan. That email bounced back when sent to an employee in the secretary of state’s office but was approved by a top official Friday morning, clearing the way for the Kennedy campaign to begin signature gathering efforts. A staffer in the secretary of state’s office initially approved the Kennedy campaign’s original petition that did not include his running mate (who had not been announced at the time) — a decision that the secretary of state’s office later said was an “error” becauseNevada lawstates that independent presidential candidates, by early August the year of the election, must submit a “declaration of candidacy and a petition of candidacy, in which the person must also designate a nominee for Vice President.” The campaign filed a lawsuit last week in federal court, challenging the office’s decision and asking a court to force state officials to accept the more than 15,000 signatures it had already gathered by March. The campaign said this interpretation would contradict anotherstate lawthat prohibits more than one candidate from being listed on the declaration of candidacy. The campaign also alleged that the requirement to add a vice presidential candidate to petition forms is unconstitutional because Democratic and Republican candidates did not need to have named a running mate while seeking Nevada’s delegates in the February presidential primary. The campaign’s websitesaysit is hosting an “HQ Debut” on Friday at the First Friday event in Downtown Las Vegas, where it will unveil a bus wrapped with giant images of Kennedy and Shanahan. Kennedy’s entrance into Nevada’s presidential contest could shake up the race, though it is not clear whether it would benefit President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump. Surveys byFox Newsreleased earlier this week found Biden trailing Trump by 5 percentage points in Nevada, regardless of whether third-party candidates were included. Ina trio of Nevada pollsconducted in May, Kennedy’s place on the ballot boosted Biden in two of them. In the otherpoll, which found Trump and Biden tied without Kennedy included, his place on the ballot boosted Trump’s lead to 5 percentage points.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-campaign-sues-nevada-alleges-counting-of-non-postmarked-mail-ballots,True,"The Trump campaign has filed its third lawsuit challenging election procedures in Nevada, now alleging that state elections officials are counting non-postmarked mail ballots after Election Day, without providing clear evidence of such a practice occurring. Thesuit, announced Monday and filed in Carson City District Court by lawyers also representing the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Nevada GOP, hinges onApril testimonyfrom Mark Wlaschin, the deputy secretary of state for elections, who said the office accepts and counts ballots received in the mail up to three days after Election Day, even if it does not have a clear postmark. State law requires all mail ballots to be postmarked by Election Day in order to be counted, butallowsfor mail ballots that have a postmark with a date that “cannot be determined” and received within the three days following Election Day to be counted. The suit alleges that the state is too broadly interpreting this law by also counting received mail ballots that are not postmarked at all. “It is therefore possible, if not probable, that mail ballots deposited in the mail after election day could arrive at mail-ballot processing facilities within the three-day deadline, and under Deputy Secretary Wlaschin’s erroneous legal interpretation, those untimely ballots would be counted if they do not bear a postmark,” the lawsuit states. The suit requests that a judge order the state to not count any ballots that lack a postmark received after Election Day. An RNC press release also said “we have discovered that Nevada election officials routinely count non-postmarked mail ballots received after Election Day,” but again did not provide any examples. A spokesperson for the secretary of state’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit, but provided amemothat the office sent to local election officials last week about the interpretation of that state law. In the memo, Wlaschin wrote that mail ballots that have been received with “no visible postmark should be interpreted to have an indeterminate postmark,” and that those ballots can be counted if received within three days of Election Day. He also wrote that the office will seek to codify the guidance as a state regulation after the election cycle. This marks the third lawsuit that the RNC and Trump campaign have filed in Nevada this election cycle. In early May,the groups suedto block the Nevada law that allows ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted up to four days after Election Day, alleging it violates federal law because it does not conform to the Election Day deadline established by the federal government. The same parties fileda separate federal lawsuit in Marchalleging serious errors in the state’s voter roll maintenance.

Read below for Ralston’s thoughts on the low turnout, high mail volume, his explanation of howThe Indywill be calling races next week, one election storyline he’s particularly interested in and why he likens many registered nonpartisans to “zombie voters.” This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Tabitha Mueller: Why do we track early voting turnout? What information does it offer? Jon Ralston: Well, it's much more valuable in the general election than it is in the primary election because in the general election, you can track partisan turnout. And that is generally indicative of what's going to happen in the election, if there's a pronounced difference, or if there's a significant registration and turnout lead by one party or if it goes against the norms. In a primary, it's not as useful except the people are interested in numbers. Eric Neugeboren: It's been interesting to see in your early voting blog just how low turnout has been so far. How much weight are you putting into this? What does it indicate for the primary? And do you think voters are not as engaged, or if this is pretty typical for presidential year primary? Ralston: Well, one thing that makes it difficult, Eric, is that voting has changed in Nevada over the last few cycles, in that there's a lot more mail once we went to everyone getting mail ballots. But that has not boosted turnout, appreciably. It's not that much different from 2022. What has surprised me a little bit is that Republican turnout is not higher. Maybe that just shows that most people are not as crazy as we are and [don’t] care much about Sam Brown versus Jeff Gunter (U.S. Senate), or [David] Flippo versus John Lee (Congressional District 4) , or even that crazy primary in[Congressional District] 3, or any of these legislative primaries that have really heated up. It'll be interesting to see if that changes in the second week of early voting. And it'll be interesting to see if Election Day turnout among Republicans is juiced at all by the fact thatTrump is coming to Las Vegasthis weekend to kind of excite the faithful, and whether that translates to primary turnout. I don't know. Mueller: You wrote that more than three-quarters of all voters who cast ballots have done so by mail, including 83 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of Republicans. Are you surprised by any of this data? Ralston: It is quite high. And there was a lot of messaging, as you know — high-ranking Republicans don't trust mail ballots, don't vote by mail. But I don't know how much of that has seeped down into regular voters. And people like voting by mail. It's easy, right? And especially if you buy the proposition that people are not that interested in the primary, but they have a mail ballot in front of them that's so easy to fill out, and there aren't that many races, they're just going to fill them out. The Democrats are turning out in much greater numbers by mail than Republicans and greater numbers overall, even though the turnout is low. And what's there for Democrats to turn out for? Are they all interested in who the next mayor of Las Vegas is or some judicial race? I don't see it. Mueller: Is there anything else you think is important to know about the data that we're looking at for early turnout, especially as it relates to the primary? Ralston: One is the Las Vegas mayor's race where Victoria Seaman, who is a Republican and appealing to the Republican base. If she can get a decent turnout, which she is, I think that increases her chances to move through. The top two candidates move through in that primary unless someone gets 50 percent plus one, which is highly unlikely. Mueller: As far as the race calls, whenThe Nevada Independentmakes a call in a particular race, what factors are editors and reporters looking at or considering? Ralston: Some of it is experience that I have in doing this, and that some of the editors have as well. But it's also just knowing the total votes that are out there. In other words, someone could have an insurmountable lead after the first results come in, which are all the mail and early votes that have been cast. If you know how many votes are likely to be out there and you have a floor and ceiling on that, you can see after the first batch [what] would be an insurmountable lead. It's just math. You can see that the [other] person can't catch up. Mueller: Thinking about the potential for miscalled races, I mean, is that something that the newsroom takes really seriously? Ralston: The bottom line is that the buck stops with me, and we're not going to make a call unless I feel comfortable that we should make a call, which is the way it should be. And I'm going to feel very comfortable before I decide to make a call. There's no difference in telling people at 9 p.m. versus telling them at 10 p.m. If you're not sure, wait for the next batch of ballots to be counted. Neugeboren: Just to put your pundit hat on for a second, what is the one storyline that you're eyeing most closely in next week's primaries? Ralston: Beyond the fact that if turnout is really low, you could have some screwy results and some upsets, I think that the federal races, despite some recent data, are probably going to go the way we think they are. I am very, very interested in whether Gov. Joe Lombardo's candidates get through in those primaries, because that's going to set the tone for the general, because if some of the other candidates get through in some of those Assembly races, that's going to really make it much harder for the governor to be able to get the Republicans out of a superminority status in the Assembly. Mueller: And is there anything else that you think is important to talk about that we didn't ask you or that you think would be good to mention now? Ralston: Primary turnout has very little correlation to general election turnout. And my guess is that you're going to see both parties send out these press releases about how well they did in turnout, and that it bodes well for the general. It means nothing. Turnout for the primary will be 20 or 30 percent. Turnout in the general is going to be 80 percent or so. It's a completely different universe of voters, and I think anyone drawing correlations there is really misleading people. Mueller: One thing we forgot to discuss is nonpartisan voters. Obviously, nonpartisans can't weigh in on these primary races. What does that mean for the general? Ralston: They can weigh in on nonpartisan races like the mayor's race, for instance, in Vegas, but I don't think it tells you much. I think nonpartisan turnout is going to be much less than what people think it will be in the general, because as I've said many times, a lot of those voters are zombie voters. They're not real voters. They're people who've been auto-registered at the DMV and probably don't even know that they're registered. They're not interested in voting. That's why a lot of these polls I think, need to be taken with a grain of salt because these national pollsters are looking at the demographics and just using that for the percentage of turnout, nonpartisan turnout is going to be much less than partisan turnout in the general.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/independent-candidate-rfk-jr-suing-nevada-over-access-to-2024-ballot,True,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign is suing Nevada’s secretary of state over the state’s requirements for independent presidential candidates to land on the general election ballot, more than two months after state officials said his campaign’s petition to land on the ballot waslikely invalidbecause it did not list a running mate. In alawsuitfiled Friday in federal court in Nevada, the campaign asked the court to stop enforcement of the state’s “ambiguous and conflicting” ballot access laws for third-party candidates, arguing the rules violate the U.S. Constitution by imposing stricter requirements on independent candidates. The campaign also argued that a state election worker’s January approval of its petition (that state officials later walked back) represented official approval and cannot be reversed. “The court must prohibit what was either rank incompetence or partisan political gamesmanship by the Secretary from invalidating petition signatures afforded the highest First Amendment protection by the United States Supreme Court,” Paul Rossi, a Kennedy campaign lawyer, said in a statement Monday. In a statement, Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said “Nevada has a rich history of independent and third party candidates for office. Each of those candidates managed to attain ballot access by following the law. We look forward to seeing Mr. Kennedy’s team in court.” The lawsuit complicates the ballot access efforts for Kennedy, who polls show couldplay spoilerin the race between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. His campaign only has roughly one more month to gather the more than 10,000 signatures required to qualify for the November ballot. Rossi declined to comment on whether signature gathering efforts had restarted with Kennedy’s running mate included. The campaign’s attorney sent a letter to state elections officials dated May 23 threatening litigation if a settlement to allow Kennedy on the ballot was not reached. CBS News first reportednewsof the letter on Friday. Kennedy, who is John F. Kennedy’s nephew, is the latest member of his dynastic political family to enter the American political world. He is an environmental lawyer who originally ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year before becoming an independent. Kennedy, 70, rose to prominence during the pandemic for hisfalseanti-vaccine conspiracy theories, including saying that“there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective”— a comment he hassince tried to walk back— thatvaccines cause autismand that the coronavirus might have been“ethnically targeted”to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people. The World Health Organizationreportsthat vaccines “are very safe” and prevent adverse effects from harmful diseases. The Kennedy campaign announced in early March that it had collected enough signatures to land on Nevada’s general election ballot, but itspetitionform did not include Kennedy’s running mate, later announced as attorney Nicole Shanahan, as is required by state law — which the secretary of state’s office said likely invalidated all of the campaign’s signatures. The relevantNevada law, according to state election officials, says that independent presidential candidates, by early August the year of the election, must submit a “declaration of candidacy and a petition of candidacy, in which the person must also designate a nominee for Vice President.” The Kennedy campaign argued in its lawsuit that this law could be interpreted as requiring both the petition and declaration of candidacy to include a vice-presidential candidate, which it said would contradict anotherstate lawthat prohibits more than one candidate from being listed on the declaration of candidacy. The campaign also noted in its lawsuit that thepetition form“provides only a single line for a single candidate.” The Kennedy campaign’s signature gathering petitionreceived approvalfrom a state elections official in January, despite not listing a running mate, which the secretary of state’s office later said was “an error.” The lawsuit contends that the secretary of state’s office exerted its official authority in granting approval of the petition, and that they should be prevented from reversing that decision. The office sent aletterto independent campaigns on March 7, two days after the Kennedy campaign announced it had gathered sufficient signatures to make it on the Nevada ballot, informing them of the requirement to include a running mate on petition forms, and said it did not hear from Kennedy’s campaign for months until the notice of an incoming lawsuit last week. The lawsuit also argues that the requirement to name a vice presidential candidate on petition forms without including a “placeholder” option is unconstitutional, because major political party candidates do not have to name a running mate while vying for their party’s nomination. Petitions from independent presidential candidates in Nevada must receive signatures from at least 1 percent of voters who cast a ballot in a congressional race in the previous election, meaning the 2024 ballot threshold is 10,095 signatures. The signature deadline isJuly 5, after which local and state elections officials undertake a signature verification process. The Indypreviously reached out to the Kennedy campaign in early May about whether it had restarted its signature gathering efforts. A spokesperson responded by saying it had no more updates since itsMarch press releasethat alleged the state had conspired with the Democratic National Committee to invent a new requirement “with no legal basis.” The requirement to include the vice presidential nominee was added to Nevada lawin 1993. Polling is split on how Kennedy’s inclusion on the general election ballot might affect the results. For example, ina trio of Nevada pollsconducted in May, Kennedy’s place on the ballot boosted Biden in two of them. In the otherpoll, which found Trump and Biden tied without Kennedy included, his place on the ballot boosted Trump’s lead to five percentage points.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/will-nevada-elect-rosen-and-trump-in-2024-or-is-recent-polling-a-mirage,True,"In aMay pollof voters in swing states, theNew York Times/ Siena College had two seemingly contradictory findings for the state of Nevada. Republican former President Donald Trump led President Joe Biden, a Democrat, by 12 points in a head-to-head matchup. Yet the poll also showed Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) maintained a 2 percentage point lead on her likely Republican challenger Sam Brown. Such a result would be a 15-point split between the top two races on the ballot — a scenario that has not occurred at such a scale since 2004, when Nevada (then in a much different political culture) re-elected both incumbent president George W. Bush by less than 3 percentage points and Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) by about 26 points. TheTimes’ survey was not an outlier. Apoll last week from theCook Political Reportsimilarly found Trump with a 9-point lead over Biden, but Rosen up 7 points on Brown. Similar divides inpolling supportbetween Senate Democratic candidates and Biden are not limited to Nevada, either. Is such an outcome possible in Nevada? If Nevada voters are truly done with Biden, would that not extend to Rosen, who frequently touts her bipartisanship and works across the aisle but whose major legislative accomplishments are the same as the president? And if Trump, who has lost Nevada twice, is indeed experiencing a new appreciation among the Silver State’s electorate, why are voters not rewarding Brown, a former Trump campaign volunteer who has invoked the former president repeatedly on the campaign trail, with that same support? Political experts said that although Nevada has a strong history of ticket-splitting, the nationalization of politics and the fact that there are still five months until the general election make them skeptical that the level of ticket-splitting indicated in these polls will actually occur. “My guess is … come Election Day, the Senate numbers in Nevada will more closely — they won't be exactly the same — but they’ll more closely match the vote for president in Nevada than what the polls today are saying,” said David Kimball, a political scientist at the University of Missouri – St. Louis who studies ticket-splitting. Nevada’s ticket-splitting history Ticket-splitting had been, until fairly recently, a common practice for Nevada voters. According to an analysis by UNLV political scientist David Damore, Nevada elected statewide representatives of different parties — presidential, Senate and gubernatorial races — in 58 percent of elections where a ticket-split was possible between 1950 and 1989. That increased to 63 percent between 1990 and 2014 — including outcomes such as the 2004 Bush-Reid split and 2012, when President Barack Obama won the state by more than 6 points while then-Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) eked out a 1-point win. But split tickets in Nevada have been less common since then. 2016 saw both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) win the state by near identical margins of about 2.5 percent. When Nevada has elected federal representatives of different parties, the Senate candidate has tended to be an incumbent. That was true of Heller in 2012, Reid in 2002 and even dating back to Sen. Howard Cannon (D-NV) in 1976 and Sen. Alan Bible (D-NV) in 1956. One notable exception was 1988, when Democratic then-Gov. Richard Bryan won his first-ever Senate race, defeating the Republican incumbent Sen. Chic Hecht (R-NV) by 4 percentage points, even as George H.W. Bush won the state by more than 20 points. Damore said ticket-splitting occurred frequently in Nevada because the state’s political establishment understands that Nevada is small and unlikely to make much of an impact in the House, so the state historically tends to favor seniority over party loyalty in its senators. Nevada senators have had long careers that spanned shifts in the national political winds, from Howard Cannon to Paul Laxalt to Harry Reid. As Reid in particular accumulated seniority and entered leadership, Damore said he often faced weak challengers (with a notable exception in1998) who were shut out of the levels of money and support it would take to win by the political class — even in extremely unfavorable national political environments, like in2010. The “Republicans for Reid” phenomenon is not totally dead — several prominent RepublicansendorsedCortez Masto in 2022 on the basis that her opponent, Republican former Attorney General Adam Laxalt, was a threat to democracy. And that attitude can help explain some voters’ reluctance to part with Rosen, an incumbent, even if they indicate (for now) that they will not vote for Biden. Historically, ticket-splitting is more common between federal and state races, given that governor’s contests often turn on local issues while presidential and Senate races are more indicative of national political environments. In Nevada, the Democratic nominees for Senate (Rosen) and governor (Steve Sisolak) won in 2018. But 2022 saw the state elect Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo and re-elect Cortez Masto, amid state-specific frustrations about a COVID response tied closely to Sisolak and Lombardo being able to overperform Laxalt in Clark County, having run and won there multiple times before as sheriff. The split in the last cycle was narrow; Lombardo won by 1.5 percentage points while Cortez Masto won by 0.77. Cortez Masto and Lombardo each received a similar number of votes (498,000 for Cortez Masto, 497,000 for Lombardo) but outpaced their respective counterpart in the other race — Laxalt had about 7,000 fewer votes total than Lombardo, while Sisolak ran behind Cortez Masto by just over 15,000 votes. It was that small — but critical — number of people who voted for both Lombardo and Cortez Masto that propelled each to victory. And it may have owed in part to the explosion of registered non-partisans in recent years, of whom there arenow moreof than Democrats or Republicans. Despite most non-partisans leaning towards one party, the increasing popularity of Nevadans identifying themselves as independents may suggest more openness to ticket-splitting. Nationally, ticket-splitting has declined significantly over the last 40 years, Kimball said. That can be owed to one’s political party becoming a stickier part of their identity as social identity groups have, on the whole, become increasingly aligned with one party or the other. And it also has to do with where the parties now fall on the political spectrum, he said. “The two parties have moved further apart ideologically — particularly the Republican Party moving to the right,” Kimball said.”So it's easier today for voters to see the policy differences between the parties than it was 30, 40 years ago.” Explaining recent polls The polling presupposes two outcomes that experts agreed are highly unlikely: that Rosen could outrun Biden by 15 or more points and that any Nevada candidate could win the state by as large a margin as polls predict. No president or senator has won the state by more than 7 points since Barack Obama in 2008. And no candidate for any statewide office has won Nevada by more than 5.5 percentage points in a decade. “I don't think those margins are anywhere accurate,” Damore said. “Because the last time anybody won that big was [Republican Gov. Brian] Sandoval in 2014,versus a nobody.” The results, then, may have more to do with the notorious difficulty of polling in a state with a highly transient population, many non-English speakers and voters who work atypical hours, Damore said. Be that as it may, Nevada is one of several states experiencing this polling trend — though the difference between Biden and Rosen was larger in Nevada than the other four swing states where Democrats are defending seats, in both the Cook and NYT polls. Cook found Senate Democratic incumbents outrunning Biden by 6 points in Arizona, 11 points in Pennsylvania and 12 points in Wisconsin. But he said although both candidates in the presidential race are well-known quantities, the relative obscurity of the Senate candidates, and Brown in particular, creates a different dynamic that could be leading to disparate results in polling. Damore expects Rosen to use her financial advantage to, as shealready has, to define Brown as an anti-abortion extremist who has flip-flopped on issues such asYucca Mountain. “Nobody knows who Sam Brown is yet, so I think she has a little bit of the advantage,” he said. And he added that he expects some Trump voters to leave the rest of their ballot blank. In 2020, Trump received about 36,000 more votes than House Republican candidates. Finally, experts speculated that polling is showing such a wide discrepancy because voters may not have tuned into the campaign. With more than five months to go until the election and the Senate primary not yet over, plenty of voters are probably not yet paying attention. “There likely will be some ticket-splitting — people voting for Trump and Rosen, perhaps,” Kimball said. “But my guess is it's voters that haven't engaged much with the campaign yet.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/analysis-which-nevada-candidates-have-benefited-from-federal-loans,True,"A new analysis shows that 9 out of 19 top candidates running in Nevada’s federal races were connected to businesses that in total received more than $10.1 million in federal government loans from 2007 to 2021. The majority of the loans came from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a U.S. Small Business Administration initiative launched to keep businesses running during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of these loans were forgiven by the federal government. The analysis found eight candidates — all Republicans — received PPP loans for their businesses, as well as the then-husband of Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), whosecasino companyreceived two government-backed loans. While these candidates have not directly criticized the PPP loan program on the campaign trail, many have criticized or promised to rein in excessive federal spending — lines of attack that have drawn charges of hypocrisy from national Democrats. “I was trying to provide students with $10,000 to $20,000 in relief,” President Joe Biden said in apress conferenceafter the U.S. Supreme Court reversed his forgiveness plan last June. “The average amount forgiven in the PPP program was $70,000.” The Nevada Independentreached out to all of the campaigns mentioned in this story to confirm the findings, better understand how the loans were used and ask whether the loans run contrary to calls to reduce government spending. Federal guidance on PPP loansstipulatedthat they could be forgiven if the funds were used for eligible expenses such as payroll costs, business mortgage interest or rent. As of Oct. 2, 2022, more than10.5 million PPP loansworth more than $793 billion were forgiven across the country, some of which included loan interest. In Nevada,businessentities (includingThe Nevada Independent) received more than $6.8 billion in PPP loans, of which the federal governmentforgaveabout $6.3 billion. The loans have beencredited withkeeping workers employed and contributing to a“historic economic recovery.”U.S. Department of Treasury economists estimated that the program may have saved as many as19 million jobs, though some economists have argued that it wasnot as helpful as other forms of aid. For this analysis,The Nevada IndependentandSunlight Searchsearched for all businesses registered to a candidate or lawmaker or their spouse and cross-checked the names of the businesses against the publicly available list of businesses that received a PPP loan. The search included members of Nevada’s federal delegation who are up for election in 2024, as well as the top candidates seeking to run against them in the November general election. Among candidates in the Nevada U.S. Senate race, former U.S. Ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter received more than $500,000 in PPP loans for a California-based dermatology clinic. A spokesperson for Gunter’s campaign did not say how the money was used, and that “President Trump's brilliant PPP program focused on revitalizing the economy and protecting American workers.” Garn Mabey, a former assemblyman running for Senate, received a nearly $50,000 PPP loan for his medical practice and an economic injury disaster loan of $6,000.  Mabey said in an email that the PPP loan was used to pay employees, who were unable to work for several weeks because the medical practice could not see patients. Palisade Strategies, a medication delivery company for veterans founded by race front-runner Sam Brown, received a PPP loan worth more than $20,000. A spokesperson for Brown’s campaign said that he repaid the loan in full and that his company “provided essential services to veterans who needed emergency medications that were unavailable through the VA.” In Congressional District 1, GOP candidate and Las Vegas restaurateur Flemming Larsen received $2.5 million in loans, about 56 percent of which were PPP loans. Larsen’s businesses have also receivedloansfor small businesses that cannot obtain the necessary credit in the private marketplace but have shown an ability to repay the loans, as well as otherdisasterassistanceloans from the pandemic. In an interview, Larsen called the PPP program “essential” and said it helped him continue to pay his restaurant employees during the height of the pandemic, noting that if he didn’t take the loans and had to lay off his employees, “they would have been paid by the federal government anyway, so you had to pay them through me, or pay through unemployment.” “I think PPP was essential,” he said. “I think it was great. I think the government had to do it if they were going to close everybody down.” The other Congressional District 1 candidate who received a loan was Mark Robertson, who received a $25,000 PPP loan for his accounting business. He said in an email that the loan was used for employee salaries and authorized operating expenses. Wealthy video game composer Marty O’Donnell, who is running in Congressional District 3, received more than $1 million in PPP loans for a company he founded, Highwire Games LLC, a $25,000 disaster assistance loan for O’Donnell/Salvatori Inc. — a company he started with his co-composer of the Halo video game franchise — and $1,000 in an economic injury disaster loan. A spokesperson for O'Donnell's campaign said ""we took advantage of the PPP loan program set up by the federal government so we wouldn’t have to fire employees and shut down our business permanently."" ""Yes, the federal government spends too much money, but this program created because of a once-in-a-generation pandemic is not the reason,"" the spokesperson said. ""The problem is the budgets that are bloated every year and the politicians who lack the moral courage to fight against government excess."" In 2020, Lee (D-NV)faced criticismwhen the news broke that the casino company run by her then-husbandreceivedPPP loans after she and three members of Nevada’s congressional delegation repeatedly pushed for the Small Business Association to open the loans to small gaming businesses. In a statement toThe Nevada Independent,Lee’s campaign said she was not involved in any aspect of the decision-making around the loans and had “no influence over the decision to file for PPP loan forgiveness or whether or not that application was approved.” Lee didn’t learn about the company’s intent to apply until days after the loan eligibility was expanded, the statement added. Sunlight Search, a nonpartisan organization focused on helping journalists conduct accountability research on political candidates, contributed research for this report.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/where-do-the-candidates-in-the-key-senate-district-3-primary-stand-on-the-issues,True,"The Democratic primary in Senate District 3 is a test of the political power of the Culinary Union. The hospitality workers union, which has long been a powerhouse in Nevada politics, has turned heads this primary cycle byretracting endorsementsfor any lawmaker who voted in favor ofSB441, a bill passed during the 2023 legislative session thatendedpandemic-era requirements to clean all hotel rooms daily. And in Senate District 3, a solidly Democratic district stretching from central to northwest Las Vegas, the union ishitching its wagonsto a nurse practitioner challenging a prominent incumbent. Geoconda Hughes, a nurse and the daughter of Culinary Union Local 226’s former secretary-treasurer, is squaring off in the primary against Sen. Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas), an attorney appointed to the open Senate seat in 2022 after a four-year stint in the Assembly. From January through March, Nguyen raised more than $72,000, compared with Hughes’ less than $7,000 haul, though she had only entered the race a couple of weeks before the reporting period ended. Hughes has centered her campaign around Nguyen’s vote to end the daily hotel room cleaning requirements. The bill passed overwhelmingly and was eventually rendered moot for union members in major Las Vegas hotels because the union’s new contract reinstated the requirement. Hughes has accused Nguyen of siding with casinos over workers, and Culinary released anadlast week accusing Nguyen’s vote of taking money away from hotel employees. Nguyen has defended her vote because the policy had the narrow intent to protect workers during the peak of the pandemic. But where do the candidates stand on the other issues? The Nevada Independentreached out to both candidates to better understand their policy positions. Nguyen declined to be interviewed for this story through a Senate Democratic Caucus official, while Hughes agreed to a phone interview. Nguyen’s issue stances are based on her prior votes and statements. While both candidates’ policies appear to be largely aligned, Hughes said she wants to prioritize bringing more nurses and mental health personnel into the workforce, while Nguyen’s priorities are less clear because she declined an interview, though she hascampaignedon lowering prescription drug costs. Click below for where each candidate stands on the following topics. Health care Education Gaming Economic development Housing Gun control Election reform Health care Nguyen has leaned into her support ofAB250, a bill that would have seen Nevada piggyback off the federal Inflation Reduction Act — which allowed Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs beginning in 2026 — byapplying those price caps statewide, not just to those on Medicare. Culinary officials testified in opposition to the bill, arguing for the issue to be introduced in 2025 (closer to when the federal drug pricing negotiations begin) and for a more collaborative bill process, though a union spokesperson later toldThe Indythat it did not oppose the legislation but had to register as an opponent to suggest changes. Meanwhile, Hughes did not say whether she would have supported the bill, adding that she would have “listened to the union's concerns about the timing.” She also said any affirmative vote would have not made a difference because Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed the bill. Hughes, whose son has Type 1 diabetes, said she was a supporter of the Culinary-backedbillin 2017 to mandate greater transparency from manufacturers of insulin drugs. Hughes also said she would prioritize improving the state’s nurse-to-patient ratio by lowering fees for nursing students. At UNLV, for example, nursingstudents must payup to nearly $240 more per credit than the university’s standard credit rates, depending on the course level. “There's a big burnout rate, but would it be such a high burnout rate if we made the environment just a little bit easier for the nurses?” Hughes asked. In 2023, Nguyen supportedSB375, whichprovided fundingto higher education nursing faculty. Hughes also thinks the state does not have enough mental health facilities and recalled one time when the Rawson-Neal Psychiatric Hospital was closed, meaning hospital emergency rooms were transformed into mental health facilities. She said she wants to see more funding for higher education scholarships for those entering mental health-related fields, such as a newschool psychology programat Nevada State University where students are eligible for scholarships and internship stipends. “I have a lot of friends that work in the psych facilities and just different psych environments,” Hughes said. “You have to be a special person, and you have to have the love for the career. And so we need to attract people into those careers.” Meanwhile, Nguyen sits on the state’s Interim Finance Committee (IFC), a panel of lawmakers that makes funding decisions when the Legislature is out of session, and has voted toallocate millions of dollarsin pandemic relief funds into mental health efforts. She is also vice chair of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. Both candidates also support theballot effortto enshrine abortion rights in the state Constitution. Nguyen was a primary sponsor of a similar bill thatpassedthe Legislature last year. Hughes also said she does not support requiring minors to receive parental consent before obtaining an abortion. Education Hughes and Nguyen are both opposed to using state funding for school choice options, such as providing subsidies for private schools. At an IFC meeting last August, Nguyen joined other Democratic lawmakers inopposingusing federal pandemic aid money to fund a school choice scholarship program. She said at the time that the need for more funding looked like “a manufactured crisis that was created to expand this program.” Hughes also said that state tax dollars should only go toward the public school system. Asked about specific ways to improve the public education system, Hughes said she wants to push for legislation to keep older and more experienced teachers in the classroom but declined to go into specifics. ANevada Independentanalysisearlier this year found that lower-performing and higher-need schools tend to have less experienced teachers. Nguyen was a primary sponsor on multiple education bills last year, includingonevetoed by Lombardo to require schools to offer summer school for the next two years as well as transportation and meals for students. Gaming One bill that is guaranteed to come up in 2025 will again pitlabor unions against the casino industry. The Legislature passed ameasurelast year to remove the state’s 159-year-old constitutional ban on lotteries. The bill must again pass next year and then be approved by voters in 2026 to take effect. Nguyen supported the bill, siding with the unions. Hughes said she would do the same because of supporters’ stated intention to use lottery revenue to fund youth mental health programs. Economic development Nguyen voted against the $380 milliondealaimed at bringing the Oakland A’s to Las Vegas. “Can you explain to me why we need to provide hundreds of millions of dollars for a billionaire’s team to come to the Las Vegas Strip, on some of the most valuable property in the world, if we can’t provide funding for critical resources for summer school and health care?” shesaidduring one Senate hearing. The special session legislation included a requiredcommunity benefits agreementthat required the Athletics to invest $500,000 annually in the Las Vegas community while the stadium is under construction, and the greater of either $2 million or 1 percent of annual revenue in the ensuing years. The team also pledged to ensure diversity and living wages in its hiring processes. Hughes said she would have liked to have seen a “stronger” arrangement, though she did not explain what that might have looked like. The bill had the backing of labor groups including Culinary because of its potential for job creation. “If I had been able to strengthen the package, I would have voted for it,” she said. Housing Among the most controversial housing policies in Nevada is thesummary eviction process, which requires a tenant, not the landlord, to make the first filing in an eviction case. Nguyen supported a measure (AB340) that would have required landlords to make the initial filing in an eviction case, but Lombardo vetoed it. Hughes toldThe Indythat “evictions happen too fast” in the state, but that she would have to look more into the summary eviction process. Hughes also said she wants to increase the staffing for state rental assistance programs and make rental aid forms easier to understand. Nguyen supported a 2023billto provide $18 million in rental assistance. Gun control Lombardo vetoed three gun control bills last year, all of which Nguyen supported alongside the rest of the Democratic caucus. Read more:Lombardo vetoes three Democrat-backed gun control bills Hughes also said she would have supported all three bills. Gun control is a personal issue for her. When her son was a sophomore in high school, he was taking an SAT prep class at a local church when an unclothed man entered with a gun, she said. Eventually, her son’s teacher took the class outside and authorities arrived. “It was absolutely one of the scariest moments of my life,” she said. “It makes me very emotional to even think about it.” Soon after, the 1 October mass shooting happened, and Hughes was working at a hospital where victims received treatment. “If my family has gone through that multiple times, then I can only imagine what other families are going through,” Hughes said. Election reform Hughes said she wants to protect early voting and universal vote by mail. As an assemblywoman, Nguyen supported thepandemic-era expansionof mail voting and the subsequentpermanent expansionof mail voting in 2021. Hughes also said she opposes requiring voter ID because IDs are not free, but “that would be a different story” if IDs were free. Nguyen also opposes voter ID because she believes it would disenfranchise older voters and voters of color, and she thinks that the current election laws support free and fair contests, a Senate Democratic Caucus official said. Hughes also wants to place stronger limits on how much money corporations can give to political candidates (candidates can receive as much as $10,000 from a single entity per election, but large businesses often circumvent those restrictions by donating the maximum amount through affiliated businesses) and wants poll workers to be trained to assist people with disabilities, such as vision or hearing impairments.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-candidate-larsen-admits-in-audio-to-hiring-illegals-now-calls-for-immigration-reform,True,"In an audio recording obtained byThe Nevada Independent, Republican congressional candidate Flemming Larsen said he employs undocumented immigrants at his California restaurants, referring to his employees as “illegals.” Larsen, who is running in the Congressional District 1 Republican primary to take on Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), owns several restaurants in Southern California. In audio of a conversation from a “Coffee with the Candidate” event in February obtained byThe Indy, he lamented the amount of fentanyl coming over the U.S.-Mexico border and said that crossing points should be closed. But he alsoacknowledgedthe importance of immigrant workers in the U.S. economy. “There’s not a single person in this race that understands how important migrant workers are to our country,” Larsen said in the recording. “We need them here, and we need them here legally though.” When asked if he employed migrant workers, Larsen said he employs “a lot of illegals,” atermthat immigration advocates have longarguedis dehumanizing and incorrect, considering that entering the country without documentation is not a crime. Larsen went on to say that if he were to ask prospective hires about their immigration status in California, the American Civil Liberties Union would sue him. In California, the state’s civil rights departmentprotectsundocumented immigrants from being asked about their immigration status by a prospective employer unless compelled to do so by federal immigration law. Once hired, however,wage theftis a prominent issue for immigrant workers in the restaurant industry in particular, where fear of deportation often keeps workers from speaking up and allows employers to exploit their status to withhold benefits or pay. In a Friday phone interview, Larsen said he assumed some of the people he hired over a decade ago were undocumented immigrants because they had brand new driver’s licenses and Social Security cards and did not speak English. Larsen expressed openness to significant immigration reform in Congress that would allow more migrants to enter the country legally and work. He proposed a “red card” system, in which migrants arriving at the border could receive a background check within three days. If they pass, they could receive an 18-month work permit. Provided they pay taxes and commit no crimes in that period, they would be eligible to renew the permit indefinitely until they could apply for legal residency. “We have to come up with a system to allow these migrant workers that want to come here and work, to come here and get vetted quickly,” Larsen said. He noted that his parents were migrant workers who came to the U.S. from Denmark, and that his experience in the restaurant industry made him sympathetic to the backlog and expense that migrants experience. But he also added that such a system would only be possible once the border is more secure. Larsen is one of five Republican candidates running in the district’s June 11 Republican primary. Of those, he is by far thebest-funded, because he has loaned significant sums of his own money to his campaign. He finished the first fundraising quarter with more than $1.5 million in cash on hand. Congressional District 1, where Larsen is running, has a significant immigrant population. It includes areas such as East Las Vegas, which has a heavy Hispanic immigrant population, and Census data shows that over 22 percent of the district’s residents were born outside of the U.S.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/democratic-assemblywoman-city-councilor-face-off-in-reno-area-senate-primary,True,"From Nevada’s longest-serving state Sen. Bill Raggio to outgoing Senate Minority Leader Heidi Seevers Gansert (R-Reno), the state Senate district in southwestern Washoe County has long been home to the Legislature’s most powerful Republicans. But under boundary lines redrawn in 2021 that shifted the balance of electoral power in the district, Democrats have a prime pickup opportunity in Senate District 15, a seat that, if flipped, could give them their first two-thirds Senate supermajority this century. First, Democrats have to decide on their own nominee for the seat. The contested race pits Angie Taylor, a former two-term Washoe County School Board member and one-term assemblywoman backed by Democratic legislative leaders, against Naomi Duerr, a Reno city councilwoman first elected in 2014 who is in her final term. The two Democrats hold similar views on many issues — from opposing the use of public funds to send children to private schools to prioritizing the recruitment of more health care providers. But in recent interviews, Taylor and Duerr pitched themselves as different kinds of thinkers and prospective senators. Duerr, a geologist and longtime government worker, said she brings a “different style of analysis” because of her background as a scientist and expertise on water issues. “What informs me in making decisions on any bill, whether putting it forward or voting on it, is the people,” Duerr said. “I view my role as their advocate, a facilitator, an informer and a builder of consensus.” Taylor leaned on her experience as a lawmaker, saying she is familiar with “how to bring people together” as well as the Legislature’s deadlines and procedures. She also emphasized her background in education, saying her school board experience makes her uniquely positioned to tackle what she described as the most important legislative issue. “The Senate Democrats endorsed me in my campaign,” Taylor said. “They trust me to be able to work well with them, to continue the work that we did.” From the start of last year through the end of March, Taylor has reported raising $195,000, compared with $87,000 for Duerr (both launched their campaigns inearly September). The June 11 contest will also feature Johnny Kerns in the Democratic primary, with the victor facing the winner of a three-way Republican primary race between Sharron Angle, Mike Ginsburg and Mark Neumann. Redistricting has given Democrats a stronger built-in advantage in the seat, with the district now more urban and suburban and less rural than in years past. As of April, Democrats have a 5.3 percentage point advantage in voter registration over Republicans in Senate District 15, compared with a 0.01 point advantage in April 2020. In elections before that, Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the district. Below, we explore Taylor and Duerr’s views on a variety of key legislative issues: Economic development When it comes to the major tax incentive deals that have come to define economic development in Nevada — such as the $380 million public financing deal lawmakers approved last year for a Major League Baseball stadium in Las Vegas — each candidate cautioned restraint. “There may be certain cases where tax incentives are required, but I would consider those to be very limited,” Duerr said. Duerr cited the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center as an example that shows the “good and bad” of such incentives. Pointing to Tesla, which established a factory at the industrial center with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tax abatements, she noted the positive of job creation, but expressed concerns about the downstream strain on housing and government services. Duerr said she believed the first round of incentives that attracted Tesla to Northern Nevada was appropriate, but thesecond roundapproved for Tesla last year was not. “Do we need ongoing tax abatements to support somebody who's already established here? I don't think so,” Duerr said. Duerr and Taylor both opposed the deal meant to attract the Oakland A’s to Las Vegas. Taylor, one of 15 Assembly members tovote againstthe bill in a special session last year, said she “wasn't comfortable with the assumptions that were made for the financial projections,” including predictions about the attendance for baseball games at the proposed stadium. Taylor said she is not “anti-incentives,” however, and cited her experience as a small-business owner (she is CEO of Guardian Quest, which provides organizations with equity, diversity and unconscious bias training) as evidence of her support for businesses. But she emphasized that any incentives offered should provide a “good deal” for the state. Asked about the proposal to eliminate Nevada’s constitutional prohibition on state lotteries, Taylor said she would support the measure again if elected. She voted in favor of theproposed constitutional amendmentin 2023, and lawmakers would need to pass it again in 2025 before it would go before voters in 2026. “My overall view is that the bill didn’t say we're going to have a lottery. The bill said that it could happen,” Taylor said, adding that she wants to see more research on what impact a lottery could have on the state. Duerr said she “would be generally supportive of the state lottery,” noting that the state needs new ways to generate revenue. Education Taylor, who holds a doctorate in educational leadership from UNR, touted her part in supporting ahistoric increasein K-12 education funding approved during the 2023 session. But she noted that legislators “should continue to be mindful that [the increase] doesn't get us to the nationalaverage” in terms of per-pupil spending. Duerr’s main priorities for K-12 education include reducing class sizes and providing additional support staff who can work with students who have behavioral issues. Duerr also supports technical schools, including providing students a way to begin technical education earlier in high school and coordinating with labor unions on such efforts. Both candidates said they support students having a choice on their education but that they do not support using public funds to pay for children to attend private school. That is a key friction point between the state’s Democrats and Republicans, such as Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has pushed to increase funding for school choice programs. Elections Although both candidates are confident in the state’s existing election laws, Duerr said she hoped to see additional election support provided to rural and Native American communities. Duerr, who spent years as a poll manager in Reno, said she supported Democratic Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar’s efforts to increase the state’s presence in election administration. “He's trying to make the elections more secure,” she said. Taylor highlighted her support for increasing protections for election workers, building on work done in the 2023 session. She also said she believes there should be criminal penalties for “fake” electors because “protecting our democracy is critically important.” Taylor was among the lawmakers last year to support a bill that would have criminalized the act of submitting a false slate of presidential electors, but Lombardovetoedthe measure. Environment Duerr, who previously worked as the Nevada state water planner and director of the Truckee River Flood Management Project, said “there's a lot to be done” when it comes to environmental policy. Duerr said she hopes to pursue efforts to expand the tree canopy in Las Vegas and Reno, which rank as two of thefastest-warming citiesin the country. Duerr previously spearheaded a program calledReLeaf Renothat seeks to expand Reno’s urban forest and mitigate warming. Duerr also supports the transition to renewable forms of energy, with a focus on solar and geothermal energy. She has 36 solar panels on her own roof, but said more work needs to be done to make solar an affordable option. Though Taylor said she is not an expert on climate, she said Nevada is uniquely positioned in terms of energy because of the amount of wind and sun in the state. Taylor also said she hopes to see the state do a better job of securing federal matching funds to support programs in the state. Health care Duerr and Taylor said they’re focused on the affordability of health care and access to care, as well as the shortage of providers in the state. Duerr said providers struggle with a “lack of reimbursement” and inadequate pay. Duerr also wants to address the stigma that surrounds seeking help for mental health issues. She said that her father was a psychologist and her stepmom was a psychiatric nurse. Citing her experience as a breast cancer survivor, Taylor said she supports capping prescription drug costs in line withAB250, a bill supported by Democratic lawmakers last year and vetoed by Lombardo that would have capped costs for prescription drugs at the maximum fair prices negotiated by Medicare. “Wepay morefor prescription drugs in our country than just about any other developed country, so we know they don't have to be as high as they are,” Taylor said. Duerr and Taylor said they would protect a woman’s right to an abortion and both support aproposed constitutional amendmentthat seeks to enshrine a “fundamental right to reproductive freedom” in the Nevada Constitution. Enacting the amendment would make it more difficult to overturn protections for abortion that currently exist in state law and that can only be overturned by a majority vote of the people. “I believe that unless it is enshrined in the Constitution, it's going to always be at risk,” Duerr said. Housing To address the state’s housing crisis — and alackof affordable housing units to meet the current demand — Taylor said the state needs to focus on incentivizing builders to develop more supply. She citedAB310from the 2023 session as an example. The bill allocated $32.2 million for a supportive housing grant program, and moving forward, Taylor said she hopes to continue to create similar incentives for building more housing. Duerr said that because affordable housing is often tied to the area median income, housing costs can rise quickly in a place such as Reno, where wages have risen significantly with the growth of high-paying manufacturing and technology jobs. In response, Duerr supports capping rent increases for seniors. Last year, Taylor voted forAB298, a measure vetoed by Lombardo that would have implemented temporary rent caps for seniors and those living on Social Security. Asked about the state’s unique summary eviction process, which requires a tenant to make the first filing in an eviction case rather than the landlord, Taylor highlighted her own experience as a landlord (she has reportedowningtwo rental properties) and said she sees why the landlord should be the one to initiate such a proceeding. Duerr called the existing process “wrong” and “backwards.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-leaders-react-to-donald-trumps-guilty-verdict,True,"A jury found former President Donald TrumpguiltyThursday on all 34 counts against him in a criminal trial over whether he sought to influence the 2016 election by falsifying business records through payments made to an adult film actress to not talk about their alleged sexual encounter. The charges, including one that carries a penalty of up to four years behind bars, come as Trump — the Republican nominee for president in the 2024 election — allegedly masked a hush money payment as a legal expense. It marks the first time a former U.S. president has been convicted of felony crimes. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 and has already said he will appeal the verdict. Here’s a selection of reactions to the verdict from Nevada political leaders: Statementfrom Gov. Joe Lombardo (R):“I respect the work of the jury but believe that this has been a political witch-hunt in a hostile courtroom … President Trump will have an opportunity to appeal, and I expect an unbiased process will vindicate President Trump.” Statementfrom Nevada Republican Party:“The partisan farce that unfolded today can be described as nothing short of a radicalized campaign stunt born of a highly conflicted trial. We stand in complete support of President Donald J. Trump and resist the charges upheld in today’s judgment.” Statementfrom Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV): “We know that Donald Trump is willing to do anything to protect his own interests, including undermining our elections. No one is above the law, and I’m glad to see justice served today.” Statementfrom Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV): “For the first time in our nation’s history, a former President is found guilty of committing multiple felonies. Today our justice system has proven that Donald Trump, a twice-impeached, four-times indicted, morally bankrupt individual is not above the law.” Statementfrom Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV): ""If you think justice is blind in New York City, better think again. It is an embarrassing and sad day for a Country that has for hundreds of years operated on the premise that prosecutions and politics should never be mixed."" Statementfrom Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown: “This has been a sham political trial from the beginning, all because DC Democrats are afraid of LOSING and answering for their failures this November.” Statementfrom Attorney General Aaron Ford (D) : “At the core of our country's legal system is the idea that a person must be held accountable for their actions, regardless of their political career … I know emotions may run high in the aftermath of this verdict, and I urge everyone to remain calm as our justice system continues its work."" Statementfrom former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt (R): “The degree to which the Democratic Party and Soros backed partisan prosecutors are willing to damage the integrity of our Republic in order to promote their own political advantage is horrific and ominous. …  Let’s hope this sham conviction of President Trump is overturned promptly.” Statementfrom former Nevada GOP Chairwoman Amy Tarkanian: “Whether you believe justice was served or it was a sham, today is undeniably a sad day for our great nation. This moment is a major embarrassment for the world to witness.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sam-brown-backtracks-on-nuclear-dump-says-yucca-is-dead-and-shouldnt-be-revived,True,"In 2022, U.S. Senate candidate Sam BrowndescribedYucca Mountain as an “incredible loss of revenue for our state.” After theLos Angeles Timespublished audio of those remarks in late April and set off a firestorm of criticism, the Republican front-runner likely to challenge Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) backtracked. In apost to Xon Saturday, Brown clearly expressed his opposition to the nuclear waste repository and acknowledged that the project was dead, adopting a consensus shared by most Nevada politicians and voters. In an audio recording obtained byThe Nevada Independentof a speech to supporters at a Las Vegas early vote rally that same day, Brown reiterated his opposition to the repository and explained his reasoning for changing stances between his 2022 run for Senate and now. Brown told supporters he was first asked about Yucca in a candidate forum in 2022, saying the issue had “never been a priority of mine.” “Not knowing a ton about the history of where it’s at, I just said I think we should always have an open mind to consider if something could be beneficial for the state,” he said. “That was kind of it.” Brown, who moved to Nevada in 2018, said he’s since been educated on the issue. “I’ve done a lot more research since then,” he said. The Brown campaign confirmed that the audio recording was from a conversation he had with an activist Saturday, but declined to commentbeyond his X post. In the intervening period between his change of opinion on Yucca, Brown caught flak for the recording fromDemocratsandRepublicansalike — underscoring Yucca’s sticking power as a campaign issue in Nevada, more than 35 years after the so-called “Screw Nevada” bill designated the Nye County site as the permanent home for the nation’s spent nuclear fuel. Yucca history From the moment Yucca Mountain was selected as the only site the Department of Energy should study for nuclear waste repository potential in 1987, Nevada leaders have fought against each successive step in the process, successfully killing the project for the moment through legislative power, legal filings and presidential appeals. Led by former Sen. Harry Reid(D-NV), who kept any efforts to fund the project’s licensing off the Senate floor as majority leader and elicited promises from Democratic presidential candidates to let the site lie dormant, Nevada lawmakers — including Republicans such as former Sens.John Ensign(R) andDean Heller(R) and former Govs.Kenny Guinn(R) and Brian Sandoval (R) — haverejectedthe repository. In 2018, when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would resume licensing on the project, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)kept itfrom getting a vote in the Senate to protect Heller, facing a re-election bid he would ultimately lose to Rosen. The Nevada delegation’s five Democrats areunitedin their desire to see Yucca stay dead; the state’s two senatorsfiled a billto repeal the section of the law that originally designated the site as the country’s nuclear waste storage site. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), the delegation’s lone Republican and a representative of Northern Nevada, supports further study of the project butvoted againstthe 2018 bill to fund its continuation. Brown’s comments In Brown’s initial comments on Yucca in 2022, made during his insurgent U.S. Senate primary bid against eventual GOP nominee Adam Laxalt, he said he worried that another state could “steal that opportunity” if the federal government did not move forward with the repository in Nevada. “We all know that Nevada could use another great source of revenue, and it sure would be a shame if we didn’t monopolize on that and become a central hub of new development that we can do at Yucca,” he said in the 2022 recording, which was published two years later by theL.A. Times. After the story was published, Brownsaidhe was “not strictly committed” to supporting the opening of Yucca, and his communications director Kristy Wilkinsontold theNevada Currentin early May that Democratic efforts to call Brown out amounted to a Reid-esque “dirty political tactic of fear-mongering for votes.”. The hits kept coming. Jeff Gunter, Brown’s biggest primary opponent, started airing anadhighlighting the Yucca comments and alleging Brown did not care about the damage radiation can do. Democratstrotted outRory Reid, son of former Senate majority leader and chief Yucca blocker Harry Reid, at a press conference to blast Brown’s comments. Former Sen. Richard Bryan (D-NV), the chair of the state’s commission on nuclear projects,wrote an op-edmaking the case anew that any Nevada senator must stand against Yucca. Brown ultimately said he was opposed to the project in aMay 25 post to X. “Over the past month, I’ve invested time speaking with engineers and experts on Yucca Mountain,” he wrote. “It is abundantly clear that the project is dead.” The audio of his Saturday comments reiterate that his stance changed through “research,” as he put it, including acknowledging that the issue is more complex than Congress moving to resume progress on the site. Severalobstaclesstand in the way of Yucca ever being operational — cost, a lengthy licensing process, the lack of practical shipping routes, the proximity of U.S. military installations and the prospect of litigation from the state to block any new action. “Yucca is dead,” Brown said on the recording. “It couldn’t even be functionally opened. And I’m not going to open it.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/whos-funding-negative-campaign-mail-legal-loophole-helps-some-groups-avoid-disclosure,True,"Political mail pieces that have arrived in North Las Vegas residents’ mailboxes attack state Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) as “‘Dirty Deal’ Neal,” alleging she has been “soft-on-crime for decades [and] has tried to destroy our police department and community.” It’s the latest escalation in a key Democratic state Senate primary fight between Neal and Nevada System of Higher Education Regent Laura Perkins, who is backed by several top North Las Vegas officials whooftentangledwith Neal during the 2023 legislative session. The stakes are high — the Democratic primary winner will almost assuredly represent this North Las Vegas district in Carson City for the next four years. The mailer (and another one highlightinga recent FBI investigationinto Neal) was paid for by North Valley PAC, which wasregisteredApril 10 by North Las Vegas Councilman Isaac Barron. Barron initially agreed to a phone interview withThe Nevada Independentlast week, but did not respond to calls or text messages on Tuesday. But because of a loophole in state law, the PAC will not need to report who is funding it or how much it spent until a month after the state’s June 11 primary election. Thanks to a 2017 change in how often candidates and PACs are required to report their contributions and expenditures, political operators now have a two-month window during which to set up PACs and spend money on the state’s June primary election without having to report how much they’re raising or who is funding them until July 15 — about a month after the primary election. ANevada Independentanalysis foundthat at least 20 new PACs and political nonprofitswere registered with the Nevada Secretary of State’s office between April 1 and May 15 — slotting nicely into the loophole between campaign finance reporting deadlines and the June 11 primary election. One such PAC is “Every Eligible Nevadan,” which was registered May 10 to a North Carolina political consultant who previously worked for theNorth Carolina Democratic Party. That PAC has so far spent about $1,000 onFacebook adssupporting Washoe County Commissioner Clara Andriola, highlighting her endorsement from Gov. Joe Lombardo and saying she will “SECURE OUR ELECTIONS.” Kenneth Miller, an assistant professor of political science at UNLV, described setting up a PAC late in the election season as “one of the oldest strategies to hide where your money is coming from.” “It's always an issue when voters don't know where the money that finances our campaigns is coming from,” Miller said. He said in instances where there aren’t candidates involved, such as ballot initiatives, knowing where donations come from helps voters judge the intentions of a PAC and its sincerity. It’s important for voters and election observers to ask why an entity would hide its donors or take advantage of loopholes, he said. “[The North Valley PAC is] just a perfect example of this kind of lack of transparency that we’ve evolved towards in elections over the last two decades,” he said. “We don't really know who's behind all of the communications.” In 2017, Nevada lawmakers passed a bill (AB45) that, in part, shifted campaign finance reporting deadlines to a quarterly system, in line with the schedule followed by candidates for federal office, but without any of theadditional transparency requirementsfor reporting pre-election fundraising totals. The law also instituted cash-on-hand reporting for candidates. Previously, candidates for non-federal office and PACs followed a campaign finance reporting schedule more closely tied to the actual dates of the primary and general elections. The change in reporting deadlines wasan amendmentoffered by Sen. Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) — a concept that wasn’t discussed during ahearingon the bill. During a work session, or a vote on the bill out of committee, the only discussion around the change in deadlines related to a need for consistency and how it would work in practice with senators who serve four-year terms, with then-Sen.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/meet-marty-halo-composer-backed-by-lombardo-would-be-among-wealthiest-house-members,True,"In early 1964, the Beatles appeared onThe Ed Sullivan Show. That fall, California Gov. Ronald Reagan gave his famous “A Time for Choosing” speech in support of Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) as the GOP’s presidential nominee. Nine-year-old Marty O’Donnell learned two things that year — he wanted to be a rock star, à la Paul McCartney, and he was a conservative Republican. He achieved the first dream — after an early career writing television and radio jingles, O’Donnell became famous in the video game world for composing the iconic music and sound design for the popularHaloseries. His compositions — including a collaboration with McCartney — have been streamed tens of millions of times and the Halo score he created is instantly recognizable to legions of gamers. Now retired, living in Southern Nevada since 2021, and worth as much as $74 million, O’Donnell is attempting to use the wealth he acquired from his musical ambitions to make his political ones possible. He’s running in the crowded GOP primary for the state’s most competitive House district: Congressional District 3. The district, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by just 1 percentage point, includes western Las Vegas, Enterprise, Spring Valley, Summerlin and the southernmost parts of Clark County. O’Donnell is an unconventional candidate. Though he’s not the first independently wealthy person to self-fund a run for office, he was recruited to run for the seat by the political team that supported Gov. Joe Lombardo in 2022 and received the governor’s endorsement. He announced his candidacy on Discord, an instant messaging and voice call platform favored more by gamers than political hopefuls, where he regularly dropsLord of the RingsandHaloreferences while interacting with fans (and even referred to running for Congress a “side quest”). His personal fortune and self-funding of his campaign enables him to forgo taking any corporate PAC money — a point of emphasis he’s made in his campaign messaging. If elected, he would be one of the wealthiest members of Congress. But O’Donnell believes his lack of a background in politics makes him a more attractive candidate. His slogan — “Less lawyers, more composers” — reflects that attitude. “People seem to want to go to Washington because they want a career,” he said in an interview. “They want political power. They're looking for influence or money. None of those things are interesting to me.” Who is O’Donnell? If he were elected, O’Donnell would be one of the wealthiest members of Congress. Hispersonal financial disclosure— a document all congressional candidates have to file detailing their holdings — places the value of his assets and unearned income between $21 million and $74 million. The wide range is related to how the personal financial disclosure system works: candidates report the value of their assets in broad categories, such as $5 million to $25 million. Much of O’Donnell’s wealth is held in stock holdings through individual retirement accounts and an investment portfolio he holds as a limited partner. He also has millions through mutual funds and exchange traded funds. His most valuable stocks include millions invested in technology companies: Apple, Adobe, Amazon, Microsoft and Nvidia among them. His biggest asset is the equity he holds in Bungie, the video game company and developer ofHalowhere he worked as audio director for over a decade, both while it was a subsidiary of Microsoft and when it split back off as an independent venture. Worth between $5 million and $25 million, O’Donnell’s equity will begin being paid out in July. That level of wealthwould make himone of the 25 richest people in Congress based on 2021 data, and in the top 10 when going by the higher estimate. He would be therichest memberof the Nevada delegation as well, though Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), also wealthy, has assets worth up to $24 million. A native of the Chicago area, O’Donnellmovedto Seattle in 2000 after the video game studio he worked at was acquired by Microsoft. He said he visited Las Vegas frequently over the past 15 years because his daughter moved there. In 2021, he moved to Southern Nevada and made it his primary residence, buying a home in Lone Mountain and incorporating his company there in 2022. According to Clark County property records and his financial disclosure, he owns two rental properties in Las Vegas. In total, he expects to earn between $55,000 and $115,000 in rent this year. He also earns some income from music royalties, autograph signings and a Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) pension — making him a conservative union member like Reagan, a former SAG president who as president went on to fire striking government workers. O’Donnell has served for years in various positions at the nonprofit Center for Faith and Culture, a Washington State-based organization working to “rekindle the spiritual, intellectual and creative vitality of Christians,” but did not take a salary for this position. Race Dynamics In the primary, O’Donnell is facing former state treasurer Dan Schwartz, who has run in the district before and is also independently wealthy from his time as abanker and entrepreneurin Hong Kong. Other candidates include tax analyst Drew Johnson and former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien. The primary is awash in cash — Schwartz plunged $800,000 into his campaign in the first quarter of 2024, with O’Donnell loaning his campaign $500,000 and Johnson pitching in an additional $200,000. With the national Republican apparatus staying out of the race — in prior cycles, then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy hadput his thumbon the scale — O’Donnell is banking on his Lombardo endorsement and putting a primary-leading $330,000 into broadcast and cable advertising, according to ad-tracking firm AdImpact. O’Donnell’s five spots on the air include pledging not to take corporate PAC money and promising to “stand with President Trump to end the invasion at our southern border.” In responding to a May 20 question on his Discord about his “vanillaads,” O’Donnell replied, “Gotta get through the primary. Not that many folks in the district have played Halo.” The only other Republican in the primary on the air is Schwartz, who hasone 30-second adtouting his experience in the Army and state government and similarly tying himself to Trump on the border and on taxes. Schwartz has committed $236,000 to getting up on television. Lee , who has won three straight elections and beat her 2022 opponent by 4 points, is waiting on the other side, with a war chest of over $2 million and planned fall spending from a Democratic leadership-aligned super PAC. The equivalent Republican groupdid notinclude Las Vegas in its initial ad reservations list, suggesting that the cavalry may not be coming to oust Lee with the same might that it tried to last cycle. A swing district that has not gone Republican since the 2014 red wave and had its Democratic registration advantage boosted after 2021 redistricting, CD3 under its current lines voted for President Joe Biden by a nearly 7-point margin. Political values O’Donnell identifies himself as a political conservative, more comfortable referencing classical themes in political philosopher Friedrich Hayek’sThe Road to Serfdomand the J.R.R. Tolkien-verse than the crude heuristics of the Trump-era Republican Party. His politics are rooted in a belief in a small federal government with low taxes and limited regulation that does not impede or penalize “family values” like having and raising children — the Reagan-era platform. “The government is a necessary evil,” O’Donnell said. “And basically it's there to protect people to be free to have their choices and their values.” He said he’s more interested in free market approaches than government interventions to support families, though he said he would be open to potentially increasing the child tax credit. And while his campaign said he opposes abortion, he believes the issue should be left to the states and would vote against a national abortion ban. He has voted for Republicans in every election, including Trump twice. But dating back to his youth, he said not every Republican fully embodies his values. “Sometimes I have to hold my nose a little bit,” he said. While O’Donnell plans to vote for Trump a third time this fall and calls himself a “supporter” today, he wasn’t always on board. He called Trump an “idiot” on Twitter in early 2016 during the Republican primary, and said that he “loath[ed] Trump” inlate 2017, preferring conservative intellectuals of prior eras such as William F. Buckley and Milton Friedman. That’s not uncommon, including among his opponents. Schwartzsaidhe was “a little uncertain” about Trump in a 2017 interview. But in a primary electorate where the first principle is often loyalty to Trump and his agenda, he’s drawn ire from right-wing activists such as former state attorney general candidate Sigal Chattah, who has attacked him multiple times, includingpostinga screenshot of O’Donnell’s 2016 tweet and said “anyone but [O’Donnell] will suffice” for the primary. And if O’Donnell does make it through the primary, Lee and Democrats will surely take the opposite tack, portraying him or any potential opponent as a MAGA extremist in line with Trump. But he believes his advantage, in either race, is being an outsider. “They're tired of the same old political hacks going to Washington,” he said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/could-veterans-swing-nevadas-2024-senate-race,True,"Of the states that will decide the 2024 election, Nevada has thehighest percentage of its populationwho are veterans — a civically minded voting bloc of anestimated 200,000with the power to swing a swing state. Traditionally thought of as a Republican constituency, Democrats have made recent inroads to bolster veteran outreach, run more candidates who served in the military or have a national security background. In 2016,national exit pollingshowed former president Donald Trump with a 27 percentage point advantage with veterans over Hillary Clinton; by 2020, that lead hadnarrowedto 10 points. In Nevada, veterans have proved more persistently conservative compared to the national averages. In 2020, Trumpwon70 percent of voters who had served in the military to now-President Joe Biden’s 29 percent. Exit polling for the 2022 Senate race did not include questions on military service, but small shifts in the veteran vote could be the difference in a state known for its tight margins. In the U.S. Senate race, the veteran voter calculus will be affected by Republican front-runner Sam Brown — a retired U.S. Army captain who suffered severe injuries from a 2008 roadside bomb explosion in Afghanistan that left him scarred with third-degree burns. Brown is a Purple Heart recipient whospeaks oftenabout how his near-death experience and extended road to recovery inspired him to run for office. Brown or whoever emerges out of the state’s June 11 primary will face Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV). While not a veteran herself, Rosen, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has been a key player on veterans’ issues in Nevada —advocating for a new VA hospital in Reno, voting for andhosting numerous eventsto promote the veterans health care-focused PACT Act and championing legislation thatcutsbureaucraticobstaclesfor veterans orpromotestheirtransitionsinto the civilian workforce. “Whether it’s securing the first-ever dedicated Veterans Business Outreach Center in Nevada or expanding health care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, Senator Rosen has built a long record of getting results for the heroic Nevada men and women who have served our nation,”a Rosen spokesperson said in a statement. In an interview withThe Nevada Independent, Brown said that while veterans have issues unique to them, such as VA health care, he believes they should support him on the same basis that other voters choose Republicans — concerns about the border, inflation and energy policy. “My ask to the veterans is — who do you want leading on behalf of not just our particular, unique veterans issues, but on all issues that impact our life?” Brown said. ‘Pragmatic’ voters Veterans’ advocates on both sides agreed that veterans tend to be solutions-oriented voters who prefer candidates that reflect that mentality. “We're very pragmatic,” said Mike Kelly, a Nevada veteran who works with the progressive veterans group VoteVets. “We are very much willing to listen to all sides. However, what's more important to us is delivery. If you're not delivering something to us, if you're not serving, if you're not solving problems — what's the use?” For Kelly, that attitude makes Rosen — the daughter of a World War II veteran — the most attractive candidate. He said while Brown is a hero who served his country with honor, Rosen has consistently delivered on veterans’ issues while being approachable, with a staff quick to connect veterans to the services they need. “It's not that I'm in any way, shape or form degrading his service,” Kelly said of Brown. “However, I need a senator that’s ready to do the work right now. And she stands on the issues that are important to most of us right now.” That includes hersupport of the PACT Act, the largest expansion of veterans’ health care in a generation. Rosen has crisscrossed the state during congressional recesses urging veterans to claim their new benefits, and frequently hosts roundtable discussions on issues that matter tostudent veteransand veteran business owners. She secured funding for a veterans’ cemetery in Elko and a commitment from the Small Business Administration toopena Veterans Business Outreach Center in Las Vegas in 2023, the state’s first such outpost, and a second one in Northern Nevada. Ross Bryant, an Army veteran and director of UNLV’s Military and Veterans Service Center, voted for Trump in the last two presidential elections, but plans to vote for Rosen this year. He voted for Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) in 2022 as well. “No one has anything but respect for [Brown’s] service, his injuries, his intentions,” Bryant said. “But he’s not from Nevada. And you don’t need to be a veteran to make a difference for veterans, because Ms. Rosen has been amazing.” Kelly added that Rosen pays attention to issues that affect veterans of color and women veterans, includingaccess to abortion. Rosen’s campaign noted that she has been engaged on veterans’ issues since she was a member of the House — the first bill she ever introduced was aimed athiring student veterans, and that she leads an annual Senate effort to increase affordable housing voucher funding for homeless veterans. Her office maintains a 70-pageveterans’ resource guidefor Nevadans navigating federal programs. On the Republican side, Leo Garcia, an Air Force veteran who works as a senior advisor for conservative, Koch-backed Concerned Veterans for America Action (CVAA), said Brown’s military service is electorally powerful. His support of Brown, whom CVAA has endorsed, owes to his embrace of fiscal responsibility and desire to keep the U.S. out of foreign conflicts. While Garcia is a veteran of the Gulf War, Brown is relatable to younger veterans who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. He said he’s been in rooms with Brown where young veterans are drawn to his dynamism and the ways he speaks about his service — including those who would otherwise vote for Democrats. “Some of them will jump ship because of Sam,” Garcia said. “They will vote for Sam because of his military background. He lives the life of a veteran. He understands the struggles that we all go through.” Brown is not the only veteran in the race. While lesser-known and with lower fundraising totals and polling numbers, Tony Grady, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, and Bill Conrad, a retired lieutenant colonel from the U.S. Army, are also hoping their military experience can help elevate them in the Senate primary. Grady, who said he has hosted veterans roundtables around the state, agreed that veterans are looking for candidates with a track record of accomplishment rather than rhetoric. He said many of the issues he hears about from veterans relate to bringing down instances of veteran suicide and fixing bureaucratic issues with the VA, particularly on loans and health care. His appeal is based on his 20-year military experience, which he said is more robust than either Rosen or Brown, who had to medically retire due to his injuries. And he argued that Republicans have long served veterans better, in politics and in outside organizations. “What we see on the Democrat side is a lot of headlines and a lot of error,” Grady said. “They want to see action.” Several veterans’ advocates mentioned that they look for congressional candidates who understand the gravity of sending American troops into conflict. It’s a prescient issue this election cycle, with the U.S. arming Ukraine and Israel in their respective wars and aiding Taiwan as tensions increase with China. And it’s one area where the candidates notably differ. While Rosenvotedfor foreign aid packages providing security assistance and supports Biden’s Ukraine policy, Brown has beencritical of spendingon Ukraine aid. Trump, whom Brown has endorsed, hasgone further, urging Republicans to block Ukraine funding, suggesting Ukraine should cede territory to Russia andthreateningto “encourage” Russia to attack U.S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) who don’t pay their share. Bryant said that approach to foreign policy is uninformed and contributes to his decision to vote for Biden and Rosen this cycle. “I don’t give a shit if we buy a javelin rocket for every grandma,” he said. “I’d rather have us provide weapons to keep the world at balance and prevent further war.” Bryant said he can no longer support the GOP nominee after the attempted insurrection on January 6. He said Trump’s behavior since that day — including comments about wanting torule as a dictatorand rhetoric about Ukraine — fly in the face of the Constitution he defended in the military. While he believes younger veterans are rightfully concerned about the economy and may stick with Trump and GOP Senate candidates, many will find it hard to vote Republican. “The case, in my mind, against Mr. Brown is, he’s a big, huge Trump election denier,” Bryant said. “If you’re pro-Trump, I would say a large portion of veterans [can’t support you] — because of the Constitution.” Brownacknowledgedin 2021 that Biden won the election, while also criticizing former attorney general and primary opponent Adam Laxaltin 2022for not doing enough to help Trump's legal challenges to the 2020 presidential election results in Nevada. On the trail Rosen is no stranger to campaigning on veterans’ issues — in 2018, shereleaseda television ad criticizing her opponent, then-Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV), for a “D” grade from a group representing veterans of recent wars. And veterans played a factor in the 2022 Senate race as well, when Laxalt, who served in the Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps,attempted to hammerSen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) about her lack of service. But while Cortez Masto reiterated many of the same accomplishments as Rosen has, Brown, who visibly wears the scars of his service, is a different opponent. While Rosen does significant work on veterans issues in her official capacity, making the case that she is the best candidate for veterans on the campaign trail will require tactful messaging if Brown is her opponent. “It's very challenging,” Kelly said. “He's a brother veteran who was severely wounded, so he has a lot of respect.” Still, the PACT Act was mentioned in Rosen’sfirst ad of the cycle, a 30-second missive focused on establishing her bipartisan bona fides that notes she “worked with both parties on things like helping veterans exposed to burn pits.” The Brown campaign is leaning into his military experience, making it the centerpiece of how he positively defines himself in ads. In both spots he has up on the air, his veteran status is the first thing viewers learn about him. “As a combat veteran, I know what it means to fight,” he says in hisfirst ad, over pictures of him from his time in the military. Ultimately, Brown said he hopes veteran voters judge Rosen based on concerns about the border, crime and inflation rather than something more specific to their needs as veterans. “I appreciate the things that Senator Rosen has done or attempted to do to support veterans,” Brown said. “But for veterans, there's multiple issues about their well-being. How are they doing with their own personal financial situation? How are they doing with regard to crime in their communities? “We're not only defined as veterans.” This story was updated at 9:45 a.m. on 5/27/2024 to add context about Sam Brown's stance on the validity of the 2020 election.

A governor-endorsed former police officer is fending off a chiropractor who narrowly lost two years ago.These are three Assembly primaries thatThe Nevada Independentis monitoring closely because of their potential to divide Democratic and Republican constituencies. Read More: The four most interesting Democratic state Senate primaries in Nevada In two of these races, the winner of the June 11 primary will most likely prevail in the general election because the districts are solidly Democratic. In the other race, Gov. Joe Lombardo’s endorsement power is being put to the test as his backed candidate is facing a well-funded GOP primary challenge in a district that Republicans are hoping to flip in 2024. Democrats control 28 of 42 seats in the Assembly, giving them a two-thirds supermajority that allows them to overturn any vetoes issued by Lombardo, a Republican whovetoed a record 75 billsafter the 2023 session. Flipping just one Assembly seat and at least maintaining the current balance in the Senate, where Democrats control 13 of 21 seats, would maintain Lombardo’s effective veto power. And outside of political control of the chamber, recently redrawn districtsfavoring Democratsand substantial turnover among Assembly members (more than 15 who served in 2023 arenot running for re-election) means the June primary will play a huge role in determining who goes to Carson City in 2025. Here’s a closer look at the dynamics in the three races. Assembly District 27 - Alex Velto vs. Heather Goulding Assembly District 17 - Mishon D. Montgomery vs. Linda Hunt vs. Chauntille Roberts Assembly District 21 - Jon Petrick vs. April Arndt Assembly District 27 In Northern Nevada, where two sitting Democratic lawmakers won theirinitial bids for officewithout the supportof the Assembly Democratic Caucus, the Assembly District 27 Democratic primary could signal how much sway the caucus holds in the North. Heading into the primary, Assembly Democratic Caucus-backed candidate Alex Velto, an attorney, held anarrow fundraising leadover his opponent, Heather Goulding. However, he has a $25,000 cash-on-hand advantage. The two Democrats are running to represent the open district — which encompasses parts of Northwest Reno, bordering UNR’s campus and sections of Sun Valley and Golden Valley — after Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno) decided to run for state Senate. Whoever wins will have a general election matchup with Republican Carmen Ortiz, who is running unopposed in the primary. Goulding, a senior project manager at an energy research and evaluation firm, received an endorsement from Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada. She was also endorsed by the Culinary Workers Union 226, whichhas split with legislative Democrats this cycle. Asked about the caucus endorsement for Velto, Goulding said the caucus largely consists of Southern Nevada representatives and that culturally, Northern Nevada is different from Southern Nevada. “Do those people understand our community and what the needs are of Assembly District 27?” Goulding said. “I think Northern Nevadans want to pick their own representatives.” In 2019, Goulding worked in a volunteer capacity to help pass legislation establishing an education program in partnership with the National Guard for 16- to 18-year-olds who are credit-deficient to gain life skills and graduate on time. “Government can and should be impacting people's lives in a positive way,” Goulding said. “As ‘pie in the sky’ as it sounds, I want to leave the world a better place than when I got here.” She said her priorities include having Nevada’s school funding reach at least the national average and increasing the number of mental health providers in schools. Goulding also wants to bolster the number of reproductive care providers in the state by looking at loan forgiveness legislation or increasing university training opportunities. Velto, a labor and litigation attorney, was endorsed by the Clark County Education Association, Southern Nevada Building Trades Union, police unions, the American Federation of State County Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 401 and the district’s last representative in Taylor, who he said leaves “big shoes to fill.” “I am running for office because I like solving problems,” Velto said in an interview. He said he joined the Reno Planning Commission to make zoning changes that could improve the ability to develop affordable housing, and now wants to address similar issues in the Legislature to help expedite the development of affordable housing. On labor issues, he wants to address problems that state unions face when they achieve a contract through arbitration, but don’t receive funding because the Legislature — which only meets every two years — has to be in session to approve spending on higher wages won through arbitration. Velto said that what differentiates him from Goulding is the “unique skill set” he developed while serving on the planning commission and experience he gained representing dozens of labor unions in legal matters. Velto also said he can relate to teaching professionals because of his time as an adjunct professor at UNR, where he has taught acourse focused on legal matters. Goulding said what differentiates her from Velto is that her work has always been values-based. She referenced anop-ed Velto publishedin April stating that he left his previous employer after “my boss made it his mission to challenge a person’s right to choose.” Velto had worked at the Hutchison and Steffen law firm, whose previous Northern Nevada managing partner, Jason Guinasso, has represented several anti-abortion groups in court (and who is an occasional columnist atThe Nevada Independent). “There's no work that I've done that I would say that I have to apologize for, or that I need to run away from,” Goulding said. After Velto’s op-ed was published, two separate op-eds responded to his comments, one byGuinasso, who characterized Velto as immature but committed to reproductive rights, andone by longtime abortion rights lobbyist Elisa Cafferata and former Assemblywoman Sheila Leslie thatdetailed past actions by the firm against Democrats and said, “Voters should consider whether … [Velto’s] joining the recent chorus of candidates who have read the polls and are taking a stand for political gain.” Velto said he went to work at the firm because of the mentoring opportunities available from Democratic attorneys who also worked there. “[In a] 70 attorney law firm, you're gonna have different perspectives,” Velto said about the op-ed by Cafferata and Leslie. “It’s truly a misunderstanding of how law firms operate to try to characterize and lump me in with what was one person taking on their political views.” Assembly District 17 In the reliably blue North Las Vegas district encompassing the Nellis Air Force Base, Culinary Union-backed Linda Hunt is squaring off against the Assembly Democratic Caucus’ pick, Mishon Montgomery. The seat is open after Assemblywoman Claire Thomas (D-North Las Vegas) opted to run for the open Senate District 1 seat. As of mid-April, Montgomeryhad raised$47,500 more than Hunt, who announced her bid for office after Montgomery and is largely supported by individual contributions and donations from union groups. Montgomery’s highest contributions come from Democratic groups and other state lawmakers. A third Democratic candidate, Chauntille Roberts, is also running, though her fundraising is much lower than that of either Montgomery or Hunt. The Nevada State Education Association teachers union has endorsed her. Republican Robert Olson is the only Republican running in the primary and will automatically advance to the general election. Montgomery, a United States Air Force veteran and motivational speaker who works with organizations on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, has received endorsements from the Southern Nevada Building Trades Union, the Las Vegas Chamber and the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund. Hunt is a union shop steward and food server at the El Cortez Hotel and Casino who has been endorsed by several unions, including the AFL-CIO, which represents more than 150,000 members, and the American Federation of State County Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 4041, which represents 17,000 state workers. “Talking to the community members … there’s a lot of issues and concerns that they have and they feel like politicians have not listened,” Hunt said in an interview about why she’s running for office. “I'm just an everyday working food server … We need someone that understands the working person.” Hunt said her parents moved to Las Vegas from Mississippi in 1961 because of segregation and Jim Crow laws in the South. Her parents belonged to unions, and Hunt said they taught her that unions offer job security and a way to advocate for workers. Hunt said she’d like to see full-time teachers replace long-term substitutes in area schools, the development of community centers and the hiring of more police officers from the local community. Hunt, who also works as a real estate agent, added that she has seen people who can’t find affordable housing and wants to look at legislation to cap rent increases and reform the state’s eviction process. Asked what differentiates her from Montgomery, Hunt said she’s been focused on voters and hasn’t thought about her competitor much. “When I get up to Carson City, I'm going to do whatever is right for the people,” Hunt said. “They are the ones that elect me in. So I'm going to make sure that I work for them the same way I’m a shop steward and I work for the members inside my hotel.” Montgomery joined the Air Force in 2002 and retired 22 years later in North Las Vegas, where she was stationed at Nellis Air Force Base. She said she decided to set down roots in Southern Nevada because she felt like she’d found a place where she could be herself and be comfortable and supported as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. As someone who served overseas, Montgomery said she didn’t get the chance to get into politics until she moved to Nevada and got involved with the Air Force Sergeants Association, which lobbies for veterans on Capitol Hill. In that capacity, she said she was able to speak out about issues that affected active duty members, saying the experience made her want to get more involved in politics. “Service is just woven into the fabric of my DNA, and so, how do I continue to be of service to a place that I love and call home? This is one of those avenues,” Montgomery said. Montgomery has an acronym for the issues she’d like to focus on in the Legislature: “HEAVY” or Health care and lowering prescription drug costs, Equality, Affordable housing, Veterans and Youth. She said that equality encompasses issues such as the needs of the LGBTQ+ community and access to reproductive rights. As far as differentiating herself from Hunt, Montgomery cited her 20 years of experience in the military, her master’s degree in public administration and her strategic mindset. Though the Democratic caucus endorsed her, Montgomery said that when she talks to voters at the door, no one asks about endorsements. “It's really beautiful to have the support and I welcome it, always,” she said. “But I want to be in service to the residents of AD17 that elect me to represent them.” Assembly District 21 Two years after narrowly losing in the general election, Las Vegas chiropractor Jon Petrick is running again for Assembly District 21, but now faces a serious primary challenge in the effort to flip this Las Vegas-area district. Lombardo has endorsed political newcomer April Arndt, a retired Henderson police officer and detective. She narrowly trailed Petrick in fundraising by about $6,000 in the first quarter and had $18,300 in cash on hand heading into the primary to Petrick’s $18,100. The winner of the GOP primary will face Assemblywoman Elaine Marzola (D-Henderson), who defeated Petrick in the 2022 general election. The district has around 2,000 more active Democratic voters than Republicans, while nonpartisans make up thelargest share of party registration. In a Friday interview, Arndt said she’s lived in the district for 30 years and wanted to run for office amid rising crime and Democratic-control of the Legislature. “I think it's important for everyone to have a voice and I think it's gotten to the point now where, if we don't flip our district, we are going to have such an issue with a lack of checks and balances in our government,” Arndt said. In the realm of public safety, Arndt said she’d like to implement Lombardo’s priorities on crime reduction — such as stricter possession thresholds for fentanyl and reassessing how domestic battery crimes such as strangulation are evaluated. She added that as a mother of three children who all had different learning styles, “it’s important that you’re not dictated by your ZIP code” and will advocate for school choice programs. Arndt cited her law enforcement background as a distinguishing factor from her opponent, noting that she’s had to work with various groups, from corporations as a property detective to coordinating with hospitals and social services while serving in the special victims unit. “In [the law enforcement role], you see so many different elements of society versus working in one industry and only coming from that perspective,” she said. Petrick toldThe Indythat he and Arndt got lunch after she entered the race, and that he has “no animosity” toward her and the governor, but that he thinks they are in the race for different reasons. “She doesn't really want this. She's running because she claims and says that they asked her to run,” Petrick said. While speaking with voters, Petrick said he is leaning into his time as a doctor and as the CEO ofLas Vegas Pain Relief Centers. He said he has worked with nonprofits and helped veterans who are coming out of prison. Petrick said he’s approaching his 2024 bid in a few different ways. First, he is leaning into so-called ballot harvesting, a process he renounced in 2022 that allows non-family members to drop off another person's completed ballot. He still wants toeliminatethe process as a legislator, but because it is legal, he is using it to his advantage this go-around. Second, he has a new campaign manager and is trying to spend less money after he said he “fell victim to wasted spending” in 2022. From January through March, Petrickspentaround $20,000, after spending roughly $28,000 in the same periodtwo years ago. And third, he is changing his messaging on abortion as polls show a majority of Nevadansdescribe themselves as pro-choice. That includes making it clearer to voters that the only way abortion could become illegal in Nevada is through a vote of the people (that’s because a 1990 referendum legalized abortion up through 24 weeks). As a legislator, he also said he would write legislation to make natural remedies to mental health issues more accessible, though he did not say what those remedies might be. He said Americans are overly medicated, and that pharmaceutical companies are creating consumers, rather than cures. “As a physician, I can guarantee you I know this issue better than my opponent,” Petrick said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/whats-at-stake-in-the-two-washoe-county-commission-races-this-year,True,"In Northern Nevada’s fast-growing and politically swingy Washoe County, races for seats on the county commission are heating up, with the political lean of the panel — currently divided 3-2 with a Republican majority — hanging in the balance. The commission makes decisions on business licenses and development projects in unincorporated areas and has a key role in addressing housing availability and infrastructure improvements for the state’s second-largest county, which is navigating growing pains as its economy grows and diversifies. But the county commission also has oversight over election administration in a purple county that has been decisive in presidential and statewide contests, and its execution of that role has been under a microscope in a politically polarized time. The commission races have attracted heavy attention from the likes of Robert Beadles, a wealthy activist whose chosen candidate ousted the former commission chair in a 2022 Republican primary. In the June 11 election, a six-way Republican contest will determine whether moderate Clara Andriola — appointed to the seat by GOP Gov. Joe Lombardo and sometimes a swing vote — will hold the seat or whether someone to her right takes the spot. No Democrats have filed for the seat so the primary winner will take the role outright. In the general election, attention is likely to shift to District 1, where Democratic Commission Chair Alexis Hill will face off with the winner of a three-way Republican primary. It could be a rematch that includes Republican former Commissioner Marsha Berkbigler. Though Andriola and Hill have a significant financial advantage compared to their opponents, the incumbents are facing candidates who have political pull in the form of endorsements, mailers and funds from Beadles. Here’s a rundown of the two races and who’s running. District 4 Republican Clara Andriola is running to retain her seat as the Washoe County District 4 Commissioner. Despite facing significant criticism from other local Republicans, Andriola has far outraised her competitors and claimed a balance of more than$91,000on her last campaign finance report. RepublicanMark Lawsonhas the second-largest cash-on-hand balance with alittle more than $4,000. District 4 includes east Sparks and the Sparks Marina as well as outlying areas near Reno such as Hidden Valley and Spanish Springs. Andriola was appointed to the commission by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo in April 2023 to replace former Commissioner Vaughn Hartung, who resigned to become chair of the board of the Nevada Transportation Authority. Andriola is now facing six challengers for her seat, including RepublicansTracey Hilton-Thomas,Trista Gomez,John L. Walter IIand Lawson. Nonpartisans Gabriel Christenson andMarsela Kupfersmithare also running. If she wins the election, Andriola said in an interview withThe Nevada Independent, she hopes to continue her work clarifying equestrian laws, promoting businesses and supporting law enforcement. One of Andriola’s challengers, Washoe GOP Vice Chair Hilton-Thomas, regularly makes an appearance at Washoe County Commission meetings to participate in public comment, often discussing elections or encouraging religious practices in county meetings such as invocations. She describes herself as having expertise in election work and a long history working for Washoe County, although her employment history is in tech for the county. Hilton-Thomas received a Robert Beadles endorsement for the interim registrar position earlier this year despite Hilton-Thomas’ campaign for another role — commissioner. She is also mentioned on Beadles’ blogOperation Sunlightas a “Candidate to Support!” Hilton-Thomas said in an interview withThe Nevada Independentshe wants to work on transparency in election processes if elected. Lawson, a Republican, is also a candidate for Washoe County Commission District 4. He was previously Sparks’ fire chief but waspublicly let gowhen the city council learned about a felony drug charge against him. He recently received a$381,000 settlementfrom the City of Sparks for wrongful termination. Lawson said he wants to be an advocate for the public by increasing services for seniors, increasing transparency in elections and supporting law enforcement. Gomez, also a Republican, has experience in social work, business and real estate. Gomez said improving the life of people in her community has driven her to run. If she wins, she’d like to help the commission communicate county functions with the public she feels aren’t transparent and better represent the constituents in her district. “I'm fourth generation here. This community really matters to me,” Gomez said. District 1 Incumbent Alexis Hill, a Democrat, may face a rematch with Republican Marsha Berkbigler, who lost to Hill in the 2020 election. Hill has far outraised her competitors and ended the last campaign finance reporting period withmore than $192,000. Berkbigler hasmore than $4,500in pocket with the second-largest campaign fund among the District 1 candidates. District 1 incorporates the western part of the Truckee Meadows to the eastern Sierras and includes Incline Village and Crystal Bay at Lake Tahoe. During Hill’s four years on the commission, she has helped bring a sustainability manager to the county, supported Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen’s Truckee Meadows Lands Bill that would free public lands for development and voted on items that direct more services and people to the Cares Campus, the largest homeless shelter in Northern Nevada. Hill has also expressed her support for the Washoe County Library Board and the registrar of voters at a time when both have been criticized in commission meeting public comment periods. Thelibrary board received criticismfor organizing programming such as Drag Queen Story Hour and keeping books with LGBTQ+ themes in its collection. The registrar and county have been accused offacilitating voter fraudby Beadles and others, a claim thesecretary of state determined as false. If re-elected, Hill hopes to use the next four years to address issues in public health, housing, mental health services and infrastructure for Washoe County. Berkbigler is the only commission candidate prominent donor Robert Beadles has donated money to in the sum of $5,000. She toldThe Nevada Independentshe has no personal connection to Beadles but was aware of the campaign donation. Berkbigler also said she does not support Beadles’ election fraud claims. “I’m not an election denier,” Berkbigler said. Beadles, a prominent donor whomade his fortune on cryptocurrency and real estate, regularly spreads misinformation that the 2020 election was stolen. If she is elected, Berkbigler said she wants to make life more affordable for Washoe County residents by investing in affordable housing and investing in more affordable housing for seniors. She also wants to increase unity among commissioners and make the public records process more efficient. Republican Eugene Hoover, who has run for state Senate and lieutenant governor in past cycles, is also running for the seat. According to his LinkedIn, he is president of Silver State Courier Service, a local trucking company. If elected, Hoover wants to create a more efficient public records system, relocate funds currently allocated to homeless services to seniors and increase affordable housing. According to the latestcampaign finance report, Hoover is completely self-funded. He currently has more than $4,200 in hand after contributing $10,000 to the campaign. Republican Melissa Fitch is also running for the District 1 seat. She hasraised no moneyfor her campaign.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/politicians-are-reporting-more-harassment-just-ask-candidates-in-washoe-county-races,True,"Washoe County Commissioner Mariluz Garcia says she expected some mudslinging when she ran for her District 3 seat as a Democrat in the 2022 election. What she didn’t expect was the harassment — so severe that it prompted her to move to a cul-de-sac two years later so she could monitor who was coming and going, a step she felt was necessary so people would stop approaching her special needs children. “My primary and general elections were both like combat sports,” Garcia said. Surveillance at commission meetings. People following her home. Persistent accusations that she is not living in her district, even aftera district attorney cleared her of residency concernsandshe released documentationof a valid, in-district residence. The harassment hasn’t stopped since she was elected two years ago. Some elected officials who spoke withThe Nevada Independentsaid the situation is particularly acute in Washoe County local government, whereelection skepticand wealthyfar-right activist Robert Beadleshas prioritizedoverhauling public boards, including helping fund a campaign to successfullyoust a commission incumbent in the 2022 primaryaccusing him of cheating on his wife and selling drugs. Beadles declined an interview request fromThe Nevada Independentfor this story. Political harassment is also on the rise nationally, experts say. There is a “clear spike in threats to election officials, in threats to state and local politicians. And what we see more often than not, is those threats are connected to an increasingly mainstream set of conspiracies,” said Jon Lewis, a research fellow with George Washington University’s program on extremism, citing research fromPrinceton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative. Kelly Dittmar, an associate professor of political science at Rutgers University-Camden and director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics, added that women and people of color who are running for office are more likely to experience targeted harassment in accordance to their gender and race. That hits close to home in Nevada, which has the highest percentage of female state legislators in the nation and the second-highest rate of womenin municipal office. Garcia isn’t the only Washoe County politician who says they’ve been followed or harassed in recent years. Commissioner Alexis Hill, a Democrat, and her opponent this election, Republican Marsha Berkbigler, also reported stalking so severe they were prompted to put cameras around their homes. Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve found a GPS tracker on her car in 2022, an incident that sparked astate lawchange and an ongoinglegal battle. “I was shocked. I honestly felt sick to my stomach,” SchievetoldThe Nevada Independentin December 2022when the tracker was first found. “I would never want this to happen to a family member, a young girl. It’s an invasion of privacy. It’s stalking. It’s just super alarming.” Who is Robert Beadles? Beadles, who made his fortune on cryptocurrency and real estate, has in recent years used his money to shape Washoe County politics by funding campaigns and sending out mailers on candidates’  behalf. Read more: GOP donor trying to reshape Nevada politics pushes radical conspiracy theories, repeatedly cites antisemitic propaganda On his blog,he has referred to Washoe School District Trustee Beth Smith as “Death Smith” (Smith has battled breast cancer), called Republican County Commissioner Clara Andriola “Clara the Clown” and Hill, “Comrade Hill-insky.” His PAC has sent mailers depictingReno Councilman Devon Reese, who is part of the LGBTQ+ community, as a drag queen andclaiming the councilman left his dying wife for a man —something Reese called a“breathtaking lie.” Beadles has also sued Washoe County officials, claiming the county’s voting process skewed election results while seeking to remove former Washoe County Registrar of Voters Jamie Rodriguez, County Manager Eric Brown and Hill. Beadles also wanted the county to switch to paper ballots,a voting method that has been provento be more inaccurate and inefficient than machine tabulated voting. The Nevada Supreme Courtrecently uphelda Carson City judge’sdecisionto dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning it can’t be refiled. Beadles also used his finances and platformto supportattorney Joey Gilbert, who lost the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary to now-Gov. Joe Lombardo by 26,000 votes. Beadles and Gilbert tried to overturn the results in court, claiming an“illegal formula”was used to tabulate votes — but their challenge was dismissed and Gilbert was ordered to pay $161,000 in attorney fees. Former Reno City Councilman Paul McKenzie, a Democrat, described Beadles as “viciously attacking candidates up and down the ballot” ina recent complaint he filedto the secretary of state alleging Beadles had failed to report recent political expenses through his PAC. “A symptom of that broader disease” Lewis says what is happening in Northern Nevada is just one example of a national problem, and that Beadles is “a symptom of a broader disease” that the United States is still learning to come to terms with. “I don't think we've really figured out what to do when the call comes from inside the house,” Lewis said. Lewis identified several other examples of people prescribing to disproven ideologies and performing extreme political acts, including a major Texas PAC thatcozied upto white supremists and the attempted kidnapping plot targeting Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (that was laterdownplayedby President Donald Trump). Nationally, Lewis said conspiracy theories gain traction because it appeals to a “primal us versus them” mentality that inspires people to take up arms against a fabricated threat. Lewis also said large-scale stressors such as COVID can open up people to receive this kind of messaging because they are looking for answers. “That creates the conditions for someone who is looking for that justification to go mobilize, whether that's trying to do violence, whether that's going to [COVID] reopen protests at the state capitol, whether it's going online and sending threatening messages to someone you think is a communist,” Lewis said. Social media is also a contributing factor, Lewis said, because spreading misinformation is easy, accessible and often without consequence to the person posting it. Dittmar added that the internet has been a factor. “The modes are different now because of social media in part, and online services … the ease with which people can engage in this type of abuse has increased,” Dittmar said. Research from theBrennan Center for Justiceshowed more than 40 percent of state legislators and 18 percent of local officeholders have experienced threats or attacks within the past year and a half. Eighty-nine percent of state legislators and 52 percent of local officials reported experiencing less physical forms of abuse, such as stalking and harassment, within the same timeframe. According to a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report, people feel more justified in their attacks on local officials. In February 2021, 19 percent of Republicans and 10 percent of Democrats believed it was justified to harass members of the opposing party. The report also found 1 in 5 Republicans and 13 percent of Democrats claimed that political violence was justified in the current political climate. For comparison, in 1973, during the most violent period of Northern Ireland’s Troubles, 25 percent of Catholics and 16 percent of Protestants agreed that “violence is a legitimate way to achieve one’s goals.” However, Dittmar said harassment and abuse toward public officials is nothing new; data and politicians taking a stance against it is. Dittmar also said that because research is so new, it hasn’t been determined if women in politics are facing more abuse than male politicians. However, Dittmar said it has been proven that harassment women officials experience is more gender-based. Similarly, politicians of color face more racially targeted abuse. “It's not so much always that there's more violence, but that we understand both the types of violence and the motivation for that harassment or abuse,” Dittmar said. What this means in Nevada’s female-led governments Though female leadership islow in politics throughout the country, women have comparatively high representation in government in Nevada. Not only does Nevada have a female-majority Legislature and two women senators, but almost all of the Silver State’s most populous cities have female mayors. Sixty-one percent of officeholders on the Washoe County Commission and on city councils in Washoe County are women. Women make up 42 percent of the same positions in Clark County. But this larger number of female officials could also mean more abuse. Women officials are 3.4 times more likely to be harassed than their male counterparts, according to theThreats and Harassment Datasetdeveloped by Princeton University. Additionally, women mayors arethree times more likelyto be attacked than mayors who are men. Female mayors also""experience far more violence""than any other politician. One high-profile example in Nevada came last year, when federal prosecutors charged a Las Vegas man formaking a seriesof antisemitic, misogynistic calls to Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), allegedly threatening to “exterminate” her and “finish what Hitler started.” A study published by theUniversity of Chicago Press Journalssuggests the increased likelihood of women experiencing political intimidation is tied to perpetrators' perceptions of powerful and visible women. Dittmar said the gender and race-based harassment is a public pushing back against challenges to the status quo. “Politics has been the domain primarily of white men, for all of our history, and so when anybody else challenges or disrupts that status quo, it can create additional forms of backlash,” Dittmar said. “And some of the backlash comes in the form of harassment and abuse.” Dittmar also said local politicians may face more, but less severe, harassment because of their proximity to their constituency. “If you're a member of Congress, you probably have a higher magnitude of attacks and abuse, but it might be coming online,” Dittmar said. “You might not be in direct contact with those perpetrators as often because you are in D.C. versus in the district.” Misinformation and harassment during the 2024 Washoe County election On Jan. 30, the Washoe County Republican Party — of which Beadles is a board member — voted to kick out Andriola, saying she was no longer considered a Republican in Washoe GOP’s eyes (Andriola is still a registered Republican). During her time on the commission, Andriola —appointedby Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo to fill a vacancy on the commission last April — has been seen as a swing vote who sometimes sides with Democrats on contentious issues brought to the county, even though she is part of the 3-2 Republican majority. Andriola has been criticized for voting with Democrats 90 percent of the time, but nearly 75 percent of all the commission's votes between April 2023 and February 2024 were unanimous. She’s split with the other two Republicans on the board on a number of contentious commission votes, including supporting Hill as chair of the commission and not supporting the restoration of a public comment period before commission meetings. Hill, the commission chair and only Democratic candidate running in a Washoe County Commission race this year, said she has experienced people following her home. “I started having weird cars come outside of my house and stopping and looking like they're filming so we got cameras installed all around the house,” she said. The surveillance stopped after she put up the cameras and signs indicating that visitors were being recorded, Hill said. However, even being a part of the Washoe GOP doesn’t exempt candidates from harassment. Republican Berkbigler installed cameras around her house after she suspected she was being followed during the 2020 election and someone had poisoned her dog. Though some politicians said the harassment has gone too far, others said they expect a certain level of harassment because they are public figures. When asked if he had ever been followed, Washoe County District 4 candidate Mark Lawson, a Republican, said not to his knowledge, but the former Sparks fire chief said his time in public safety has always had him “looking in my rearview mirror to see who’s following me.” “It's sad that you can’t enjoy a private life like that, but as long as you're always doing what's right … you got nothing to be ashamed of,” Lawson said. “It's become increasingly difficult, especially with social media. They like to catch that compromising picture, tell half the story.” Beadles and others who speak during the commission’s public comment period frequently urge commissioners to make major changes to public policy, including how elections are run. In the vast majority of cases, municipalities in Nevada are limited in scope and power by the Legislature under what is calledDillon’s rule. “There are legal parameters to which you know [county commissioners] have to abide by and I pride myself in being compliant and abiding by the law,” Andriola said. Why candidates still want county seats Despite the challenges, candidates are still running for local government. Even local officials who have been in the crossfires of harassment and stalking are putting significant funds and time into keeping their seats. “To be able to serve not only my constituents, but the entire community, is more than rewarding,” Andriola said. “I love serving the community I grew up in. I love fixing problems and seeing how the county can be part of the solution,” Hill said. Dittmar emphasized that although public servants have been experiencing harassment all along, surveys seem to be showing politicians are becoming more vocal about the abuse they endure. “We've seen a lot of women and probably not only women …  who have just silently endured it as part of the cost of being a public servant in a sexist and racist world,” Dittmar said. As more research on harassment comes out, “people kind of frame it like this is new,” Dittmar added. “What's new is we're problematizing it, and thank God for that.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-supreme-court-rules-voter-id-ballot-measure-can-move-forward,True,"The Nevada Supreme Court has rejected a legal challenge that sought to block a proposed voter ID ballot measure, clearing the way for the measure to continue on its path to the 2024 ballot. In a unanimous five-page decision issued Friday, members of the courtupheld a lower court’sFebruary decision dismissing the legal challenge filed against the measure. Opponents, represented by a group of Nevada and Washington, D.C.-based attorneys who typically champion Democrat-backed causes, had compared voter ID requirements to an unconstitutional poll tax. The petition aims to amend Nevada’s Constitution by requiring in-person voters to provide valid photo identification and those voting by mail to provide a personally identifiable number — such as part of a driver’s license number or Social Security number — alongside their signature. Nevada does not require voters to provide any type of identification before voting, but each voter is required to provide a signature that must match the one in the state’s files. In their decision, members of the court wrote that they were unconvinced by the appellant’s arguments that the ballot question would require some sort of expenditure or appropriation to create a free form of identification for voters who otherwise do not have a form of identification — a requirement to avoid creation of a poll tax, which is unconstitutional. The DMVcharges feesto obtain a driver’s license or identification. Justices wrote that those arguments were “improper at the preelection stage” and cited past decisions holding that the court cannot consider substantive challenges at this juncture — only holding that it can review procedural issues pre-election, such as an initiative's description of effect. The order also upheld the measure’s description of effect (which was also challenged in the lawsuit) as constitutionally valid. “While a better, lengthier description of effect could have been drafted, we conclude that the description of effect before us is legally sufficient,” the order states. The Friday decision clears the way for supporters of the ballot question to continue collecting the needed signatures to make it onto the ballot. Petition supporters must gather more than 102,000 valid signatures from voters by June 26, with about 26,000 signatures coming from each of the state’s four congressional districts. David Gibbs, the head of the Repair the Vote PAC,previously toldThe Nevada Independentthat supporters had gathered about 60,000 signatures as of early May. "" “This ruling is a testament to the power of civic engagement and the importance of upholding the principles that form the foundation of our democracy,"" Gibbs said in a Friday statement. ""The people of Nevada have spoken, and their voices have been heard loud and clear.” Attorneys representing the appellant did not immediately return requests for comment.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/top-gop-super-pac-not-spending-in-vegas-area-house-races-breaking-from-past-cycles,True,"Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), the House Republican leadership-connected super PAC dedicated to growing the GOP’s majority, announced its initial fall ad reservations Wednesday — a sizable $141 million buy across the nation.But Las Vegas, a media market that it has poured millions of dollars into in prior cycles, was left off the list. The decision reflects national Republicans’ increasing belief that the three Democrat-represented seats in Southern Nevada are not worth the return on investment.In the 2022 cycle, CLFreserved$15 million in its first ad buy to go on the air in Southern Nevada — the most it earmarked in any media market. By the end of the cycle, outside groups had spent more than $28 million in efforts to unseat Reps. Dina Titus (D-NV), Susie Lee (D-NV) and Steven Horsford (D-NV) to no avail. In the first electionunder new mapsdrawn by Nevada Democrats to protect Lee’s and Horsford’s swingy seats, all three won another term. This time around, working withlimited resourcesrelative to Democrats and a condensed battleground map that both parties believe will come down to a handful of competitive seats in California and New York, CLF is folding in Las Vegas — at least for now. According to AdImpact, which tracks political ad spending, Democratic super PAC House Majority PAC is the only outside group to make ad reservations for House races, while a few organizations, including the conservative Americans for Prosperity and progressive Protect Our Care, are already up on the air. The lack of spending in Las Vegas reflects the expensive ad environment that outside groups are working with nationally. With their focus trained on seats in pricey media markets in Los Angeles and New York City and competing with the presidential race and marquee Senate races in swing states including in Nevada, CLF said their map is tighter this cycle. “The map is undoubtedly small, and we are in a dogfight,” CLF President Dan Conston said in a statement. And CLF has thus far raised less than it did last cycle — $25 million in thefirst quarterof 2024 compared to more than $37.5 million in 2022. The October 2023 ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) neutralized House Republicans’ best fundraiser; his replacement, Mike Johnson (R-LA), has proven capable, but affiliated groups have not been able to bring in the same amount of money as they did with McCarthy at the helm. CLF’s Las Vegas calculus could change later in the cycle, particularly if a promising candidate emerges from the primaries in any of those districts. All three districts have GOP primaries that include self-funders who have loaned massive amounts to their campaigns. But the lack of an early spend or fall reservation is telling — when CLFannouncedits first list of endorsements in April for 20 candidates, no Nevadans were included. On the Democratic side, House Majority PAC, the super PAC arm of Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY),made a significant ad reservationin Las Vegas in April. The nearly $7 million that Democrats earmarked stands only behind Los Angeles, New York, Portland, Oregon and Detroit. Outside groups typically pay more for air time than candidates, leading them to make reservations in the spring for September and October. Based on their fundraising and evaluation, they can shift these reservations later. Democrats need to flip just four seats to win a majority in the House. Of the 11 Republican-held seats the Cook Political Report currentlyranksas toss-ups, seven are in California or New York, with an additional seat in upstate New York rated “Lean Democrat” — hence the focus for both parties on those states. In Nevada, Lee’s race is rated “Lean Democrat,” while Titus’ and Horsford’s are considered “Likely” Democratic holds.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/whats-behind-mailers-accusing-state-senate-candidate-of-targeting-woman,True,"Less than a week before the start of early voting, political mail pieces began arriving in Henderson-area mailboxes stamped with bold white lettering proclaiming: “Christian Bishop A Former Reality TV Star Accused Of Targeting An Innocent Woman Online.” Aimed at voters in Southern Nevada’s Senate District 5, which covers parts of Henderson and Paradise, the mailer says that the Democratic candidate for the Legislature was “accused of pressuring a young woman for sex,” citing apodcastwhere two women discuss how Bishop, now 35 —  a former contestant onThe Bachelorette— pressured a woman almost a decade younger than him for oral sex in 2022. The mailer was sent by Nevada Legislative Victory, a PAC largely funded by incumbent Democratic state senators that has also sent mailers promoting Bishop’s primary opponent and caucus-endorsed candidate Jennifer Atlas. ""We think Bishop's past conduct is disqualifying,” reads a statement sent from the PAC. “We think Democratic voters have every right to know about Bishop's significant liabilities before voting."" Atlas and Bishop are competing in one of the most expensive and most watched legislative primaries in the state, with the winner likely to challenge Sen. Carrie Buck (R-Henderson) in the 2024 general election. The stakes are high — Democrats need to flip just one state Senate seat held by Republicans to obtain a veto-proof supermajority, which would have major legislative and political consequences for the state and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. Atlas — a paralegal and former lobbyist — has outraised Bishop, but he is outspending her and has a slightly higher cash-on-hand advantage over her heading into the primary, according to the most recently filed campaign finance reports for the first quarter of 2024.The Daily Beastreportedthat Atlas’ campaign is also running negative mailers about the allegations that call her opponent “completely creepy and seriously disgusting.” The allegations mentioned in the political mail raise questions about Bishop, a tech executive who often highlights his family, three children and support for women on hiswebsiteand onsocial media. Allegations of inappropriate sexual advances from a legislative candidate are also notable given that the 63-member body has, in recent years, weathered its own share of sexual harassment allegations againstsittingandformerlegislators. In an extensivestatementresponding to the mailer, Bishop described himself as a “proud husband, father and son” and apologized “if at anytime I made either of the women feel uncomfortable … I commit to continuing to educate myself and doing better as a man.” The Nevada Independentspoke with Bishop and the woman in this podcast to find out: What’s the full story on the claim in the mailer? ‘I don't really know where your intentions are’ The mailer stems from a now-deletedTikTok videoalleging that a former contestant onThe Bachelorettehad pressured a woman for sex in Las Vegas and then retaliated against her for “not being submissive.” The woman, Lanae, and her friend who posted the video, Taylor, whoThe Nevada Independentis identifying only by first name for privacy reasons, discussed the allegations during a February 2022 episode of theShe’s All Bachpodcast focused on current and former contestants fromThe BachelorandThe Bachelorettereality shows. Lanae spoke withThe Nevada Independentfor this story. In the podcast, Lanae said Bishop struck up a relationship with her over Instagram while she was visiting Las Vegas from Salt Lake City. In the early stages of communicating, Lanae said Bishop texted her requesting nude photos, but she didn’t want to send any until they had gotten to know each other in person. She said he respected her stance and was persistent about meeting her in Vegas, so she thought he might genuinely be interested in a relationship. She took him up on an offer for him to pay for a hotel and drove with a friend out to Las Vegas to meet him the last weekend of January 2022. Lanae told the podcast hosts that after reaching the hotel and as they were getting ready to head out for the night, Bishop told her she never fulfilled “(her) end of the deal” by providing nude photos and subsequently asked her to perform sexual acts. She said she declined. “He came back at me with, ‘mmm I think like, I don't really know where your intentions are. I don't know if I should treat you like a friend or someone I'm interested in dating,’” Lanae said on the podcast. “And I'm like, ‘Well, that's what we're gonna figure out this weekend, like we can hang out as friends, get to know each other, vibe, see where it goes.’” Lanae and Taylor said on the podcast that throughout the rest of the night, Bishop expressed a desire for “dominance” over women and bragged about sleeping with “hundreds of women.” When they returned to the hotel room, they argued about expectations in a relationship, after which Bishop allegedly stormed out. They said that when they awoke the next morning, the hotel had sent them an email notifying them that Bishop had canceled the next night’s reservation. Lanae toldThe Nevada Independentin an Instagram message, “The second we arrived at the hotel and he got me alone for 5 minutes, he asked me for head.” She played recordings of the back-and-forth with Bishop during the podcast, which Taylor said both she and Lanae separately recorded because they were “uncomfortable” and Bishop was getting upset. “Pretty much what you see in the video is him just saying that he wants Lanae to do exactly what he tells her just because he told her to,” Taylor said. “At one point, I actually started bawling my eyes out because I was like so heartbroken, seeing … how he was completely disrespecting my best friend.” In the statement and in an interview withThe Nevada Independent, Bishop said he “asked the woman for consent several times … and was given direct consent by her to proceed with our communications and involvement as indicated by the text messages provided.” “At no point was I given any indication that there was an issue with our conversations or interactions via text or private conversation,” he said in a statement. “Once the women arrived in Las Vegas, it became clear to me that the dynamics had changed and that I no longer should be engaging in the relationship.” Bishop also denied that he requested oral sex, saying “I was open to it, but it wasn't an expectation or a requirement or anything like that.” He said the video recording that was later shared to TikTok and in the podcast started off as a discussion about some people they had dated who had been onThe Bachelor, and how people who appeared on the show date. “We were talking about gender roles in relationships and modern-age dating,” Bishop said. “So I was sharing my perspective, what I was looking for and what I was interested in, and we disagreed.” Bishop acknowledged that it was “definitely a passionate conversation,” and he raised the volume of his voice because he felt he wasn’t being heard. He said that when Lanae and her friend made it clear that they weren’t interested in hearing his perspective and were recording him, he decided to leave. “I was very careful, especially as a person of color, as a Black man,” Bishop said. “It still could be misconstrued and taken a different direction that something wrong happened when I thought I did what I was taught, right?” He said he let them enjoy the rest of the night and told them that he would cancel the hotel room for the following day. “I'm not sure how they misunderstood that,” Bishop said. In a follow-up message with questions about Bishop’s characterization of the meeting, Lanae said she didn’t want to discuss the incident anymore and “he treated us like shit.” Bishop said he embraces the scrutiny surrounding the podcast because the Legislature has not always been “the safest place” for people working there. “Consent, making sure people are respected, making sure that I'm being supportive, especially for women, is something that's really important to me, as a son to a single mom of four kids,” he said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-pollster-sam-brown-still-leads-nevada-senate-primary-in-internal-poll-despite-gunters-late-push,True,"With three weeks to go until the June primary election, Nevada Senate candidate Sam Brown is supported by more than half of Republican primary voters and has a 38 percentage point lead over his next closest opponent, according to a new internal poll commissioned by the Brown campaign and shared withThe Nevada Independent. Brown, who is backed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), received 52 percent of the vote in the poll, while Jeff Gunter — a dermatologist and former ambassador to Iceland — stood in second place with 14 percent. Former Assemblyman and election denier Jim Marchant polled at 7 percent, with another 7 percent split between several long-shot candidates. Seventeen percent of voters remained undecided. Though 12 candidates have filed to run in the primary to take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) this November, the poll indicates that the contest has effectively become a two-man race between Brown and Gunter — the top fundraisers and the only candidates to air television ads — with Brown still comfortably in pole position despite Gunter outspending him on the airwaves. In his ads, Brown has sought topositively portray himselfwhile dinging Democrats about inflation and concerns about the border, while Gunter — who is largely self-funding his campaign — hasattackedBrown as an establishment puppet who is insufficiently supportive of Trump. Gunter has been unafraid to go negative, repeatedly referring to Brown as “Scam Brown” and running an attack adcallingBrown, a veteran with severe burns on his face, the “newest creature to emerge from the swamp.” The poll was commissioned by the Brown campaign and the NRSC and reviewed byThe Nevada Independent. It surveyed 500 voters from May 13-16 using live telephone interviews and has a margin of error of 4.5 percent. It was conducted by the Tarrance Group, a Republican firm that polled for Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) in his 2022 gubernatorial race and has done extensive work in Nevada. Gunter’saggressive spendinghas boosted his support based on prior polling. AnOctober pollfrom the Tarrance Group found Gunter winning just 1 percent of the primary vote, while an April polling memosharedwithBreitbart Newsfound Brown with a 52-point lead on second-place Marchant, with Gunter only pulling 3 percent of the vote. But while Gunter might have upped his name identification and vote share, the latest poll results suggest that his ads are having a mixed effect. In a memo to the Brown campaign and the NRSC that was shared withThe Nevada Independent, pollsters Dave Sackett and Lauren Hutchinson note that while 99 percent of respondents recognized Brown’s name, Gunter’s name identification sat at 61 percent. Brown’s favorability is significantly higher as well, at 73 percent to Gunter’s 32 percent. Critically, respondents who said they had seen, heard or read something about Gunter were split on whether it made them more or less likely to vote for him, with 40 percent saying they were subsequently less likely to support him and 42 percent saying what they had seen made them more inclined to vote for him. “California Democrat Jeff Gunter’s disgusting ads attacking Sam Brown’s wounds that he got from an IED explosion in Afghanistan do not appear to be helping his primary campaign,” NRSC communications director Mike Berg said in a statement, referring to Gunter’spast voter registrationin California as a Democrat. And as the only marquee Senate race in which former president Donald Trump has not endorsed a candidate, the poll also found that Brown has the highest support among voters who have a “strongly favorable” impression of Trump, at 54 percent. The winner of the June 11 primary will go on to face Rosen in a race that political analystsrateas a toss-up. In 2022, Nevada was home to the closest Senate race in the nation, when Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) edged out her opponent, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, by 0.8 percentage points.",Error: Connection error.

Caroline Mello Roberson, director of state campaigns for Reproductive Freedom for All, said the group collected more than 200,000 signatures, nearly double the approximately 102,000 required by June 26 to qualify the potential measure for the ballot. Now the signatures head to election officials for verification. If enough valid signatures are on the petition, the measure will be on the November ballot for voters to consider. Supporters of the measure had to gather about 26,000 certified signatures at a minimum from each of the four congressional districts. “If we win that election with a simple majority of Nevadans voting that, yes, they want to put the right to abortion in our state Constitution, then it goes before voters again in 2026,” Mello Roberson said. “Then voters have to decide whether or not they vote yes. If they vote yes [in 2026], then it becomes a part of our state Constitution.” Abortion rights have been a hot topic in Nevada politics since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973 affirmed the legality of abortions nationwide, and then again when that rulingwas overturnednearly 50 years later. Although abortion is already legal in Nevada up through 24 weeks into a pregnancy or when required to protect the life or health of a pregnant patient, Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom is continuing to push to enshrine abortion rights into the Nevada Constitution, where they would be more secure. Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom had originally proposed a constitutional amendment that included the enshrinement of additional reproductive-related rights such as the right to a vasectomy, infertility care, prenatal care and other forms of birth control. But Mello Roberson said that they chose to focus their efforts on a version that only aims to enshrine abortion rights because “there were some folks that decided to try andintervene[with the original proposed measure] and so we put forward an alternative language focused solely on abortion rights.” Mello Roberson said that although abortion is already legal in Nevada through a statewide vote in 1990, enshrining abortion rights into the Nevada Constitution will make it harder to overturn the protections that are in state law. “We are in a crisis, like we've never been before, with reproductive freedom all over the country, including here in Nevada,” she said. “States like ours, which have statutory protections — which are awesome — need to expand those protections by putting covenant protections in our state Constitution.” Constitutional protections would help ensure “future generations of Nevadans never have to worry about whether their reproductive freedoms are protected,” Mello Roberson said. Although Mello Roberson says that Reproductive Freedom for All endorses President Joe Biden because he has “committed to codify our federal right to abortion, and that he has a strong track record of supporting reproductive freedom,” she says that in regards to the Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom coalition, it's “important to remember that reproductive freedom is something supported by Nevadans from all political backgrounds.” “That includes Democrats, Republicans, nonpartisans, and anyone in between. It also includes men and women, any gender that folks identify as, and every racial background, too,” she said. “So this is a broad coalition that will be built by Nevadans and for Nevadans as it has been so far and will continue to be so.” Jason Guinasso, the lawyer representing the group thatchallengedthe proposal, didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Monday afternoon about opponents’ strategies looking forward.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/anatomy-of-a-political-breakup-why-the-culinary-union-unendorsed-democratic-lawmakers,True,"Without the help of the Culinary Union Workers Local 226, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) might not be in the Senate. The union in 2022 worked closely with the state’s Democratic political organizing framework (dubbed the “Reid Machine” for its connections to the late Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV)) to organize and deliver a narrow victory for Cortez Masto in an unfavorable midterm election year “under the most adverse circumstances it has ever faced.” The union’s canvassing efforts and transportation of workers to the polls also supported down-ballot victories for several vulnerable Democratic constitutional office candidates, aided the state’s three House Democrats in keeping their swing seats and helped Democrats expand their legislative majorities. Some 18 months after those 2022 victories, the relationship between some Democrats and the union, which represents more than 60,000 workers in Reno and Las Vegas, has soured. In March, the Culinary endorsed twocandidates to runagainst lawmakers backed by the Democratic caucuses. And last week, the unionunendorsedevery sitting Democratic lawmaker who voted in favor of a 2023 resort industry-backed bill removing pandemic-imposed cleaning requirements from state law — drawing a bright-red line through 18 names on the union’s endorsement scorecard. In an interview Thursday withThe Nevada Independent, Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said those legislative Democrats sided with Republicans on an issue that affects working-class voters. He said the union is advocating for “better Democrats.” “Folks have to remember that politicians are not royalty, and we've got too many lawyers and management types there,” Pappageorge said. “I think that our members deserve to know whether Democrats are going to stand by working-class voters or not, and in this case, the Democrats — other than a very few — let us down.” Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) said in a statement that since he began serving in 2016, Legislative Democrats have passed pro-labor measures ranging from raising the minimum wage to strengthening collective bargaining laws, including prevailing wage and project labor agreements. “As long as I am Speaker of the Assembly, I will continue to advocate for working families and make the best decisions for Nevada as a whole,” Yeager said. “It's pretty straightforward. Any other sort of complicated story is just noise.” A statement provided by the Senate Democratic Caucus cited the party’s legislative record of working with organized labor. “We're proud to run on our members' pro-labor records, and we're confident voters will understand who the pro-labor candidates are this election cycle,” the statement said. Nevada’s labor movement is not monolithic — a group of state police unionsbackedformer President Donald Trump in 2020, and this cycle, several unions have split endorsements in several key Democratic legislative primaries. But in publicly unendorsing more than a dozen legislative Democrats, the Culinary stands alone, especially as other unions have largely backed incumbents or caucus-backed candidates. How did Nevada Democrats’ closest ally become a vocal critic of legislative Democrats ahead of the June 11 primary? What is the union trying to accomplish, and will this have any effect on other high-profile races on the Nevada ballot, including for president and U.S. Senate? Is this a breakup, or just a break? Room cleaning required by law Roots of the current conflict between the union and Democratic lawmakers go back to a 2020 special session, when lawmakerspasseda complex andcontentious bill(SB4) that shielded many major businesses from COVID-19-related lawsuits while also establishing protections for casino industry workers, outlining enhanced cleaning policies for large casino-resort companies, including a requirement that cleanings happen daily. The protections and cleaning requirements werechampioned by the Culinary Unionin memory of Adolfo Fernandez, a Caesars Palace utility porter and union member, who died after contracting the virus earlier that summer. But the bill’s passage was the result of a deal between casinos, business groups and the Culinary Union at the expense of other powerful groups, including trial attorneys, progressive groups and others who felt they were unfairly excluded from the bill’s liability protections. Almost a year later, the unionpushed the Legislature fora “Right to Return” bill that would give casino, hospitality, stadium and travel-related workers in Nevada the right to return to jobs they had been laid off from during the pandemic. Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) carried the bill for the union, invoking her parents, who were Culinary members, in a hearing. As part of the deal toenact the law, which passed on party-line votes in the Senate and Assembly with Republicans in opposition, lawmakers made revisions to SB4 that relaxed cleaning requirements, such as wiping down minibars, headboards and decorative items on beds, and reduced a requirement to clean rooms throughout the day to just a single daily cleaning. As the end of the COVID public health emergency wound down, a stream of resort industry executives, business leaders and health district representatives said SB4’s meticulously prescriptive rules were no longer applicable. Fresh off the 2022 election, state lawmakers in the 2023 sessionbrought a measure(SB441) that included removing civil liability protections, inspection requirements for health districts and daily room cleaning. “[SB4] worked then but it doesn’t work now,” Sen. Marilyn Dondero-Loop (D-Las Vegas) said in a hearing. A source familiar with negotiations around the measure said that when SB4 was passed in the special session, both provisions of the bill, such as daily room cleaning, were intended to sunset once the pandemic ended. Supporters’ reasoning for backing SB441 was that the immunity went away once the governor's declaration of emergency went away, but because of changes to how COVID testing happened, the daily room cleaning portion of the bill never sunsetted. The bill passed with wide Democratic support despite vigorous opposition from the Culinary Union, which said that daily room cleaning “was standard practice” in Las Vegas before the pandemic and that was “good policy.” The Culinary Union is not alone in its fight to protect daily room cleaning. At the beginning of the pandemic, hotel guests often declined daily cleaning services, and some companies switched to cleaning upon request rather than automatically. Since then, hotel workersacross the countryhave pushed for room cleaning requirements, emphasizing that “clean hotel rooms save jobs.” Culinary unendorses candidates The Culinary Union made daily room cleaning part of thefive-year contract negotiationswith major Las Vegas resorts that began in earnest after the legislative session. The new contracts include provisions similar to the language repealed by SB441. Still, Pappageorge said the issue “hamstrung” the union in negotiations. He said if Democrats had not removed the law, union members wouldn’t have had to make it a strike issue and could have instead negotiated for other priorities, such as a larger wage increase. After negotiations, the union achieved a 32 percent salary raise over the next five years. Pappageorge said that ending daily room cleaning directly affected union members, leading to a 30 percent reduction in work and a 30 percent potential reduction in income for those workers. He criticized Democratic lawmakers for prioritizing the casino industry. He added the unendorsements and callouts are a way for voters to understand that they need to pick better Democratic representatives in the primary. He said the union is backing two candidates, Geoconda Hughes for Sen. Rochelle Nguyen’s (D-Las Vegas) Senate District 3 seat, and union leader and server Linda Hunt in Assembly District 17, as examples of offering voters “an opportunity to choose better Democrats.” Hughes is the daughter of former Culinary Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Argüello-Kline. “It's our job to represent workers and our members and they need to know when Democrats decide they're going to team up with rich casinos, and screw workers,” Pappageorge said. “It's pretty straightforward. And any other sort of complicated story is just noise.” The Senate Democratic Caucus’ statement noted that in past sessions, Democrats worked with labor groups to pass a major expansion of collective bargaining rights for public employees, fund significant raises for home care workers and educators, ensure union labor is used on major infrastructure and construction projects, and guaranteed hospitality industry employees affected by COVID could return to their jobs. Asked if the primary will be a referendum on the power of the Culinary Union over the Democratic caucuses, Pappageorge said, “We don’t look at it that way at all.” Other tension points It’s not the only major issue on which the union has broken with Democrats. The Culinary Union, which provides members with a union-backed health insurance plan and offers urgent care and medical service centers in Las Vegas, has opposed sweeping reforms proposed by progressives at the federal level, such as Medicare for All, because it views its benefits as hard-fought and beneficial to its members. At a more local level, the union also sometimes aligns with private health insurance companies on health care legislative measures. It’s an issue that has come up in the Senate District 3 Democratic primary, where the Culinary-backed Hughes is trying to unseat Nguyen. In herfirst campaign ad, Nguyen referencedAB250, a bill that would have seen Nevada piggyback off a provision in the federal Inflation Reduction Act — which allowed Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs beginning in 2026 — byapplying those price caps statewide, not just to those on Medicare. Gov. Joe Lombardo ultimately vetoed the bill. In a hearing, Culinary officials testified that it opposed the legislation. Union representatives instead wanted the bill to be introduced in the 2025 session (closer to when the federal drug pricing negotiations begin) and for a more collaborative process. Legislative Democrats have nonetheless made lowering prescription drug prices an emphasis of their campaign this cycle. Pappageorge said that the union's unendorsements have nothing to do with health care policies, and that Culinary has advocated for broader health care issues including transparency on drug pricing and against surprise billing. When an issue affects members directly, the union (which operates its own pharmacy through its health plan for members) will stand up for them, he said. Culinary did not leave the 2023 legislative session empty-handed. It received a$25 million appropriationfrom state lawmakers for the Culinary Academy of Las Vegas, and it supported passage of a bill to publicly finance construction of a baseball stadium to bring Major League Baseball’s Oakland Athletics to Las Vegas. As part of anagreementwith the A’s, the Culinary Union will have the right to organize and negotiate union contracts for stadium workers. The Legislature also passed housing measures the union advocated for, such as transparency around rental application fees and eviction reforms, which were later vetoed by Lombardo. Pappageorge said other legislative successes are separate from what happened with the removal of the daily room cleaning requirement. “We thought we had a partnership with some of these Democrats, and it turns out we did not,” he said. “They need to be clear that when you go after workers … there's consequences.” The ‘Culinary Machine’ Well-liked by her colleagues, Nguyen is getting assists from high-power groups — including the casinos she voted with and other unions — as Culinary attempts to boot her from office. The day after Culinary announced it was unendorsing lawmakers who had voted for SB441,  American Federation of State County Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 4041 — which represents 17,000 state workers — endorsed Democratic incumbent lawmakers and caucus-backed candidates, including Cannizzaro, Nguyen and Yeager. AFSCME isn’t alone. Nguyen also has support from the Clark County Education Association and the Las Vegas branches of the Service Employees International Union, Laborers Union (which represents construction workers) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The Nevada State AFL-CIO, the state federation of labor representing more than 150,000 members from some 120 unions throughout Nevada, including the Culinary Union, notably did not endorse either Nguyen or Hughes. It did endorse Hunt, who is running against the Democratic Assembly Caucus-backed candidate, Mishon Montgomery. The union did not respond to an emailed request to discuss its endorsement process on the record. In response to whether the Culinary is standing alone, Pappageorge said the union is “not too worried about that.” He said the organization has the largest walk program in the state, adding that its membership is more active than any other group in Nevada. The union, he said, will always push back against “oversteps,” whether they come from Republicans or Democrats. State lawmakers have publicly rallied around Nguyen, who served in the Assembly before she was appointed to the Senate. Her supporters also comprise an alliance of groups that often don’t agree, including the gaming industry and the trial lawyers, both of which contributed to Nguyen during the first quarter. As of April, Nguyen hadraised$65,000 more than Hughes, and had $222,000 in cash on hand to Hughes’ $6,000. The next quarterly reporting deadline is in July, about a month after the primary election. Sources familiar with the caucuses who spoke on the condition of anonymity noted that privately, there’s frustration around the union’s targeting of Nguyen and cast the union’s campaign against her as an effort to crucify a beloved colleague, especially when no one gets everything they want during a legislative session. As for any damage to the union’s long-standing relationship between legislative Democrats and the Reid Machine more broadly? Culinary officials have said that the union will reconsider its endorsements ahead of the general election, while the Culinary said it plans to run the “largest canvassing operation in the state in the greater Las Vegas area and in the greater Reno area.” That operation will likely benefit Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and President Joe Biden’s re-election efforts, and, as a result, help down-ballot Democrats. Pappageorge said that, for the moment, the union is focused on the June 11 primary. “This is the Culinary Machine and we make a difference in Nevada,” Pappageorge said. “This is the primary. This is where we want to make sure we get the very best Democrats to take on some of these MAGA election deniers that are out there and these Republicans that really don't support workers one bit.” This story was updated at 12:33 p.m. on 5/20/2024 to reflect that the two candidates targeted by the Culinary Union are backed by the Democratic caucuses.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/can-biden-nevada-democrats-convince-voters-theyre-the-party-of-housing,True,"“Housing is so much more than just a word,” President Joe Biden told Las Vegas union members in mid-March. “It’s about people’s lives.” Nevada was a prescient choice for the president’s pitch because the state has one of the most acute housing shortages in the country. The National Low Income Housing Coalitionestimatesthat Nevada is nearly 80,000 affordable rental homes short of meeting the needs of extremely low-income renters — those who are at or below the federal poverty guideline or earn less than 30 percent of the area median income. The average home sale price in the state hasrisen dramaticallysince the pandemic, from about $300,000 in 2019 to nearly $450,000 today — one of the main cost of living challenges that have people feeling pessimistic about an economy that’s otherwise strong. Why housing? It’s the rare cost of living issue that voters seem to reward Democrats on. In anApril pollconducted by Emerson College andThe Hill, housing was ranked as Nevada voters’ number four issue, behind only the economy, immigration and education. While Nevada voters preferred former President Donald Trump on the economy and immigration, about 46 percent of respondents who selected housing affordability as their top issue trusted Biden, compared with 33 percent for Trump. Biden’s embrace of housing language on the campaign trail — and in his budget — was a welcome sign to Nevada’s congressional Democrats who say they hear about the issue constantly — though it’s received far less attention in advertising thus far as abortion or health care. “It is a real issue,” Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), who hadurgedthe vice president to bring up housing more, said in an interview. “I agree with my constituents who say rent is too damn high.” While Biden’s standard stump speech otherwise mainly focuses on his last four years in office, housing is a campaign issue that’s more forward-looking. Biden’s housing policies, outlined in his 2025 budget, would be a second term push and require a number of legislative solutions in Congress. But Democratic campaign messaging on housing is complicated by the fact that the nuts and bolts of housing policy is often determined at the state and local level. Biden proposed a suite of federal housing policy changes and investments that advocates say would represent a historic investment — but fail to entirely close gaps that have been building since the Great Recession. Trump, meanwhile, has been scant on policy details on housing, only promising to fight Biden’s “woke” incursion into the suburbs and target fair housing rules. This election season presents two dilemmas for Nevada’s elected Democrats — can they convince voters that they are the party of housing? And are their proposals big enough to create change? Read More: Nevada’s 2024 rental market stabilizing, but prices remains above pre-pandemic levels Housing history Modern federal housing policy dates back to the Great Depression. Then, a lack of access to credit made homeownership difficult and led President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress to create the Federal Housing Administration, which pioneered the 30-year mortgage. After World War II, with the Depression subsided, low-interest, fixed-rate mortgages were extended to servicemembers returning home through the G.I. Bill — making homeownership accessible after a period of underbuilding, but contributing to a more severe housing shortage than we face today. “Millions of G.I.s returned from the war, and apparently all of them wanted to get married and have children,” said Alexander von Hoffman, an urban planner and historian at Harvard University. “And everybody was caught flat-footed.” After homebuilding had ground to a halt during the Depression, the federal government worked to stimulate the creation of new housing with mixed results, throughfederal public housing, providing a stable market for builders (essentially subsidizing the creation of white suburbs through FHA standards) and experimenting with price controls and funding cities’ slum clearance and land redevelopment efforts. As the incentives helped the market correct itself, and overbuilding contributed to dropping home prices, more of the government’s focus turned towards low-income renters. The federal government’s approach shifted from building public housing — which had been undermined by structural racism and urban disinvestment — toward subsidizing private building of low-income housing and providing rental assistance. The tools created in these periods, from the 1970s to the early 1990s, are still the primary ones used in housing policy today. On the housing supply side, these include: And on the demand side, the Housing Choice Voucher Program, commonly referred to as “Section 8,” involves the federal government paying landlords about 70 percent of the cost of rent for extremely low-income, disabled or elderly Americans. With few new market interventions for the middle-income housing market, the Great Recession of 2008 cratered the homebuilding market. The deficiency has been augmented by rising construction and labor costs and local governments’ stranglehold on zoning, which makes building dense housing — such as apartment buildings and condos — illegal in many neighborhoods. More than a decade into this period of underbuilding, the pandemic hit. “Everybody suddenly wants to move into a house and rates are really low, and a bunch of people whose demand has been sort of pent up — all these millennials coming of homebuyer age — want to buy a house really quickly,” said Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of the Housing Finance Policy Center. “And so you have that layering on top of the chronic undersupply.” Nevada’s housing challenges In Nevada, the undersupply has also been exacerbated by a rapidly growing population and the persistent challenge of lack of land, with developers often complaining that the state’s high percentage of federally owned land makes it difficult and expensive to acquire and develop homes. Environmental advocates argue that development should grow upwards instead of out, building more multifamily and dense housing on existing land, but this too can be complicated by restrictive zoning policies at the local level. On top of that is the high cost of land, construction, labor and financing. “All of those things coming together certainly have driven up prices to the point where existing tools struggle — most of those coming from the federal level,” said Christine Hess, the chief financial officer of the Nevada Housing Division. Land has been Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s focus when it comes to housing as well. While many growing Western statesleadthe nation in housing deficits, Nevada has the unique distinction of being the state with the highest percentage of federally owned land, driving bipartisan interest in conveying more public land for housing. A2022 reportprepared for the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association estimated that with just 50,000 acres of land left for development in Clark County, the county may “exhaust its ability to develop by 2032.” Lombardo took a shot at Biden during the president’s March visit,sending a letterurging him to cut housing development red tape. And he laterendorseda proposal from Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) to allow the federal government to contract with land appraisers credentialed in any state — a small regulatory fix, but one aimed at making more land available more efficiently. Funding for housing, meanwhile, has increased thanks to the 2021 American Rescue Plan (ARP), which appropriated billions for pandemic emergency housing assistance. Nevada received $500 million in grant funding for the Home Means Nevada program, which it hasobligatedto affordable housing projects and homeownership programs. On the rental assistance side, the White Houseestimatesit made nearly 35,000 ARP-funded payments to Nevadans to meet their rent and utility costs. The ARP andother pandemic-era billshelped fund desperately needed new affordable housing projects into the state’s pipeline. But advocates said more federal investment — as well as macroeconomic changes such as lowered interest rates — is needed to address the shortage. Wally Swenson, the vice president of corporate affairs at Nevada HAND, the state’s largest affordable housing developer, said the state needs 84,000 new affordable units to meet existing needs. “We're last in the nation with the amount of affordable available housing that we have,” he said. “We have 5,000 units currently in our portfolio, and we have 1,900 more on the way and we're really proud of that — but it's a drop in the bucket.” In theNational Low Income Housing Coalition’s 2024 report, Nevada was dead last among all states for its affordable housing shortage, with fewer than two affordable rental homes available per every 10 extremely low-income residents. The data is similarly concerning for market rate housing. A 2022 study from theBipartisan Policy Centerfound that although nearly 245,000 housing units were permitted in Nevada between 2000 and 2009, the following 12 years only saw about 126,000 units permitted. But from 2010 to 2020, the state’s population has increased by more than 430,000 people — creating far more demand than supply. This basic economic issue has, predictably, resulted inhigher home prices. AnArchitecture Lab studyusing Zillow data found that the average home price in Nevada went up 158 percent between 2013 and 2023 — the third-highest rate in the nation behind only Florida and Idaho. And in the rental market, although average rents have finallybegun to come downafter a decade of increases, median incomes in Las Vegas and Reno remain insufficient to afford median rents. The average monthly cost of a one-bedroom apartment in both Las Vegas and Reno is nearly 50 percent of each region’s median monthly income, the point at which a renter is defined as “extremely cost-burdened.” And federal funding is not coming at the required scale. Swenson said the low-income housing tax credit, considered among the best tools for affordable housing developers, finances 10 to 11 projects per year in Nevada — meaningful, but wildly insufficient. Affordable housing developers often describe their funding approach as “lasagna financing,” cobbling together federal, state, banking, private and nonprofit streams. They emphasized that a greater investment from the federal government would be transformative, but that state and local governments need to embrace the challenge as well, including through potential zoning changes thatother Western communitieshave adopted. Housing was a big topic of discussion during the 2023 legislative session, although much of theproposed legislationinvolved temporary rental caps, protections for tenants against evictions and funding for tackling homelessness, rather than increasing or diversifying the state’s housing stock. And many of those bills were vetoed by Lombardo. Existing proposals That confluence of housing market factors has created a perfect storm of demand for new federal actions. “It's the number one thing I hear from Nevadans — from our families, from a coalition of folks working on trying to bring affordable housing to Nevada,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) said in an interview. “We need more middle-class housing.” To that end, the president and the Nevada delegation have a suite of proposals to attempt to boost the market. Their approach is through incentivization — using carrots — rather than withholding or demanding — sticks. In his 2025 fiscal year budget, Bidenproposedsignificantly expanding existing housing programs and creating new credits and grants to both boost supply and give renters and buyers new assistance, including loosening up a middle class housing market that has been curtailed by mortgage rate hikes accelerated in 2022 that aimed to rein in inflation. Experts and advocates for affordable housing in Nevada described the proposals as an ambitious step. “We need more financing,” Swenson said. “We need more players doing the work to get more developers in the space and more people doing it. We need more funding mechanisms. And so [I’m] extremely happy that the President's budget included a lot of those mechanisms and had historic funding levels.” Biden’s housing platform contrasts sharply with Trump, whose platform is light on details but high on fear,accusingthe president of ruining the suburbs with “woke left” ideology — building apartments. He alsopromisedto repeal a fair housing rule intended to prevent discrimination,sayingthe rule was unworkable when he attempted to undo it in 2020 to appeal to white suburban voters. And in Congress, House Republicans’ proposed 2024 fiscal year budget would haveslashed fundingfor various HUD programs and limited the number of people receiving rental assistance.Wait listsfor housing vouchers can last years, particularly in states such as Nevada where the voucher allocation funding formula has not properly accounted for population growth. In Southern Nevada,for example, HUD allocates just under 12,600 housing vouchers per year, but 27,000 people have applied for them. That’s not the stance of all Republicans — in the Senate, Republican senators have signed onto several pieces of Democratic legislation andRepublican governors in Western statesin particular are leaders in rezoning movements. But it has not amounted to any meaningful bipartisan legislation in Congress. At the delegation level, Nevada Democrats want to tackle high rates of corporate investment, free up more land and expand the funding and potential uses of existing tools. The federal proposals don’t tackle one big obstacle for expanding housing supply — zoning. While zoning is done at the local level, some advocates have argued that the federal government should use the power of the purse to incentivize localities to embrace zoning measures that reduce sprawl — somethingBiden’s administrationmay do in a second term. Reno is one such locality considering changing zoning ordinances to allow for more housing to be built. The city isconsideringproviding developers with incentives for building denser housing and infill development, allowing for middle-density housing such as duplexes andpermittingaccessory dwelling units such as granny flats. In Clark County, a2022 report from Applied Analysisnoted that the county’s development code prevents higher-density developments near low-density developments, such as the county’s many suburban, master-planned communities. Still, experts caution that the most effective solution to the housing crisis might be the one thing politicians can’t afford — time. “It took 15 or so years to dig ourselves into this hole,” Ratcliffe said. “It's going to take a while to dig us out.” Whither the politics? The housing crisis is a political issue open for the taking —polling findsthat Democrats, Republicans and independents alike are all equally concerned about the toll of high housing costs. Democrats argue that their record, including passing the ARP, proves that they have been engaged on the issue and delivered results, such as newsenior housing complexes. And Nevada continues to receive investments from existing federal programs, including therecent announcementof $43 million coming to the state through various HUD funds. “I've been doing the work and we have the receipts to prove it,” Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) said. “Now, there's a lot more yet to be done. We're going to continue to work on this. But we keep making a dent in every single way we can.” Still, with housing issuesrising in voter consciousness, pressure is mounting on lawmakers to go further. And it presents an interesting dilemma — should they talk about housing to ensure voters know they hear their concerns and have plans to address them? Or does doing so risk reminding voters of an economic concern that has only become more potent while the incumbents have been in office? The Nevada delegation is eager to discuss housing, and their official-side offices frequently put out press releases tied to their legislation, send letters to the administration and host in-state roundtables with stakeholders. Much of the politicking has occurred at the state level, with the Nevada Democratic PartyhammeringLombardo over rising evictions and his veto record while Lombardopromotes his own housing agenda. But federal candidates are starting to get in the game — Rosen’s campaign is launching anew adthis week highlighting her efforts to secure affordable housing funding and take on corporate investors, the first housing-centric ad of the cycle. Given howseverethe problem is in Nevada in particular — especially compared withswing states besides Arizona— it would be hard to avoid. On the trail, with little prospect of action this year, federal Democrats have tohopethat the way they talk about it will resonate with voters feeling the housing squeeze. “[Housing is] mental health, physical health,” Rosen said, potentially previewing her campaign rhetoric. “It's our economic health. All of that starts with the foundation of having some place to call home. So that's why I'm working on it.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/clark-washoe-election-officials-hope-new-technology-will-speed-up-ballot-processing-pace,True,"Nevada’s two largest counties plan to use improved technology in this year’s elections that officials say will help process mail votes faster. In a meeting last week of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections, county and state elections officials provided lawmakers with how their 2024 operations will use additional technology to speed up the pace of mail ballot processing — changes that could help determine the winner of competitive races sooner after top elections in 2022 and 2020 were not called until days after Election Day. In the primary and general elections, Clark County will use six mail ballot readers that can each tabulate 8,000 ballots per hour, an increase from two machines the county used in 2020 and four used in 2022, county registrar Lorena Portillo told lawmakers last week. The county will also use about 26 machines to tabulate in-person Election Day ballots from flash drives, up from the 10 machines used in 2022. The county is also implementing double shifts for election workers on Election Day, which Portillo said would speed up the vote-collection process. Washoe County is planning to unveil a new ballot sorting machine in between the primary and general elections. This machine does not count ballots, but rather sorts envelopes by precinct for all votes not cast in person on Election Day (mail votes, early votes and ballots left at drop boxes). The machine also scans the ballots’ barcodes and uploads the ballot status to the county website, allowing voters to see whether their ballot has been received, interim Registrar Cari-Ann Burgess toldThe Indy. The new machine will also be able to automatically check if a voter’s signature matches the one on file, a process that is currently done manually. If the machine detects a signature that does not match, county employees will manually check to see if there is indeed a discrepancy, a county spokesperson toldThe Indy. The county will also allow members of the public to test the signature verification feature before voting starts, and county staff will manually audit the system throughout the election. The existing machine, which Washoe County bought used in 2020 and is more than 15 years old, is prone to shutting down and sorts about 300 ballots hourly, while the new machine will be able to sort about 500 ballots each hour, Burgess said. She added that it typically takes about 48 hours to process any ballot after it is received, but the county is aiming to cut that down to between 24 and 36 hours. After moving to all-mail voting during the pandemic on a temporary basis, the state Legislaturepermanently enacteduniversal mail voting in 2021, while also allowing voters to opt out of receiving a mail ballot. In 2020, President Joe Biden was notdeclared the winnerin Nevada until four days after Election Day because of mail ballots that trickled in after polls closed. In the 2022 U.S. Senate race, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) also did notultimately have her race calledover former Attorney General Adam Laxalt until four days after Election Day. In 2022, nearly 40,000 Clark County mail ballots and around 5,700 Washoe County mail ballots were received after Election Day — an overwhelming majority of which were received the day after Election Day — according todatafrom the secretary of state’s office. Cortez Masto beat Laxalt by fewer than 8,000 votes in 2022. The technology upgrades come as elections officials expect voters to continue to prefer voting by mail. In the February presidential preference primary, more than 74 percent of Clark County votes were by mail, according to a county presentation last week. In the 2022 primary, more than 55 percent of Clark County votes were by mail, and all primary votes were by mail in 2020 because of the pandemic. Portillo said turnout trends in this year’s elections will play a key role in determining how the county allocates its resources going forward, adding that it may downsize in-person election staff if mail ballots continue to be the dominant voting method. Washoe County officials expect at least half of the ballots cast this year to be by mail, Burgess told legislators. That would be a significant increase from 2022, when about one-third of county votes were by mail. Nevada law allows any mail ballot postmarked by Election Day to be counted as long as it is received within four days after Election Day. Republicans, especially former President Donald Trump, falsely claimed mail ballots in 2020 were rife with fraud, but the GOP is nowencouraging votingby mail, even as Trump continues to malign the process. The Trump campaignfiled a lawsuitearlier this month alleging that the post-Election Day processing time for mail ballots violates federal law, which the Biden campaignasked to be dismissedon Monday. Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar also told legislators during the meeting last week that the state is partnering with a veterans voting group and reaching out to high schoolers to increase the number of poll workers after an employee shortagepromptedDouglas County to tap into its own employees to work at the polls for the presidential primary. “We need to give election officials every chance to succeed. That means more resources to do their job,” Aguilar said. “As we look ahead to legislative session, more consistent funding and resources will be crucial.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/berkley-campaign-manager-calls-opponent-a-bitch-in-video,True,"Las Vegas mayoral candidate Shelley Berkley’s campaign manager Tom Letizia called opponent and city Councilwoman Victoria Seaman a “bitch” to her face after a debate last week, according to a video obtained byThe Nevada Independent. In the video, which was shot before a KXNT Las Vegasmayoral debateon May 9 between top-polling candidates Berkley and Seaman, Letizia tells Seaman, “People hate you” before moving closer to her and putting a finger in her face. “Did you get the bitch stuff?” Seaman asks as Letizia says, “Don’t come up to me with your bullshit.” Seaman then tells Letizia, “Get away from me now,” — re-emphasizing the “now!” Letizia then says, “You’re a bitch,” before walking away. The episode underscores the palpable tension between the campaigns of Berkley, a former Democratic congresswoman with a long history in Nevada politics, and Seaman, a member of the Las Vegas City Council and Republican former assemblywoman. The two are considered front-runners in the race to replace term-limited Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman, the first mayoral election in nearly 30 years to not feature a member of the Goodman family on the ballot. In a statement toThe Nevada Independent, Letizia said he apologized to Seaman but that the race is “not about me.” “Sometimes raw emotions get in the way of campaigns,” Letizia wrote. “I let this get the best of me and I apologized to the councilwoman. It’s not about me, it’s about who will be best for our next mayor of Las Vegas.” The antipathy between Letizia and Seaman attests to the insular nature of Las Vegas politics. While Letizia declined to explain what precipitated his anger toward Seaman in the video, the two formerly worked together — he managed her successful 2022 re-election campaign for city council. In a statement toTheNevada Independent, Seaman said she was “disappointed by Tom’s behavior” but confirmed that Letizia apologized and said she accepted it. “I want to keep this campaign about important issues affecting Las Vegas, and I hope that Tom’s candidate, Shelley Berkley, will do the same,” Seaman said. “There is no room for name-calling or making catty remarks while debating these issues such as public safety, homelessness, education and affordable housing.” With a crowded field of 14 candidates, a recentpollfrom Emerson College/KLAS-TV/The Hill showed Berkley and Seaman at the top of the pack, but neither coming close to the 50 percent threshold needed to win the race outright at the June 11 primary. The top two vote-getters would move on to a Nov. 5 runoff in that scenario, making June’s election widely considered a contest between Berkley, Seaman and Democratic City Councilman Cedric Crear. A fixture in Clark County races, Letizia ran each of the last six winning Las Vegas campaigns for Oscar and Carolyn Goodman.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/las-vegas-mayoral-candidates-debate-policy-defend-records-at-nevada-independent-forum,True,"The three top candidates for Las Vegas mayor defended their political records and debated (at times contentiously) their qualifications, proposed city policies and leadership visions at a Wednesday evening forum hosted byThe Nevada Independent. The forum featured former U.S. Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV), City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman and City Councilman Cedric Crear, who lead in polling and fundraising, with the top two vote-getters in next month’s primary election advancing to the November general election, as long as no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote and wins the seat outright. Wednesday’s forum, moderated byIndyCEO and Editor Jon Ralston, touched on topics including the three candidates’ backgrounds and positions related to the November ballot, as well as policies such as homelessness, public education, affordable housing and the defunct Badlands golf course, which was the most contentious discussion of the night. Berkley’s candidacy marks her return to the political stage a dozen years after she lost a high-profile race for U.S. Senate, which ended her 14-year career in Congress. Since then, she has held leadership roles in the Touro University System, a private medical school. She also served one term in the state Assembly and two terms as an elected higher education regent. Seaman has represented Ward 2, which covers southwestern Las Vegas, on the city council since 2019 and previously served one term in the state Assembly as a Republican. Crear has been the councilman for Ward 5, which covers the central and northern parts of the city, since 2018. He previously served as a member of the state Board of Regents and was a city planning commissioner. He announced his candidacy for mayor in 2021 and would be the first Vegas-born and Black person to hold the position. This year’s mayoral race is the first time in 25 years withouta member of the dynastic Goodman familyon the ballot. Oscar Goodman served as the city’s mayor from 1999 to 2011, with his wife Carolyn elected that year and serving as mayor ever since. The mayor is the public face of the seven-member city council, which makes decisions on everything from infrastructure to homelessness. Fourteen candidates are vying for the mayoral seat, including Nevada Equal Rights Commission Director Kara Jenkins. There has not been much polling in the race, butan April survey from Emerson Collegefound Berkley and Seaman as the only candidates above 10 percentage points, and Crear in third, though 56 percent of respondents were undecided. Click below to see how candidates addressed the following topics: Badlands Candidate records Homelessness Education Affordable housing Grant Sawyer Building and Cashman Complex Goodman leadership November ballot The most tense part of Wednesday’s forum was the discussion surrounding the city’s legal battles with the owner of the defunct Badlands golf course. The issue revolves around the city’s taking of 35 acres of land from the owner of the golf course, who had attempted to turn it into a housing development, prompting resident backlash. The Nevada Supreme Court last monthuphelda lower court’s ruling that the city must pay $48 million to the developer, and more lawsuits are pending. The city later said it had tried to negotiate with the developer, but he did not do so in good faith. Seaman said Wednesday that she has repeatedly urged the city to settle the case, referring to her vote against pursuing outside counsel. She said the Supreme Court’s ruling was “very political.” Meanwhile, Crear said he stood with the residents voicing opposition to the development (“If I didn't, that can happen any other place in your neighborhood”), and that he does not think the city did anything wrong. Berkley, who lives near the golf course, said she also stood by the residents voicing opposition. She went after Crear for calling the developer a “bully developer,” and Seaman for taking credit for being the lone council voice against the continued legal battles, saying it “isn't leadership, it’s immaturity.” Seaman then responded by saying she never heard from Berkley (who lives in her ward) during the course of the Badlands saga. “No one heard from you, you never showed up at the council meetings about the appeals and outside attorneys,” Seaman said. Berkley said it wasn’t her job to fix the issue as a private citizen. Asked whether she is simply running because she is “bored” after being outside of politics for more than a decade, Berkley pushed back and asked “what could be a greater honor than to represent your hometown?” “There isn't anyone in the state of Nevada that I can't call that won't return the call,” Berkley said. She said she didn’t think “there are too many people in the state that knows health care better than I do.” In Crear’s campaign, he has leaned into his achievements to revitalize the Historic Westside, which is located in Ward 5, including the acquisition of a workforce training center and a program to increase the economic advancement of low-income workers. Asked about his achievements outside of Ward 5, Crear referred to traveling across the country in search of ways to alleviate homelessness and the city’s mental health crisis, and pointed to his work to expand the city’srecuperative care center. He also said in anadthat he is the best candidate at selling the city globally, which he said Wednesday is because he was born in the city and sits on a city tourism board. Seaman was pressed on several topics, including her campaign mailer that said “Pro-criminal radicals are trying to turn Las Vegas into another urban wasteland.” Seaman said crime is “out of control in the city,” especially property crime. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, however, reported a 10 percent decrease in property crimes in the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, accordingto a statewide crime database. Seaman also defendedacceptingan endorsement from Las Vegas radio host and conspiracy theorist Wayne Allyn Root, an election denier who promoted fake COVID-19 cures, by saying that she would accept endorsement from anyone. She also defended herlawsuitagainst the city that alleged she was assaulted by Michele Fiore, a former councilwoman. She alleged Fiore broke her finger after grabbing her hand, and that the city had destroyed video evidence capturing the altercation, which theLas Vegas Review-Journalreported had beendeleted. The city launched an investigation, and Seaman said Wednesday it “put us both at fault.” The candidates all took a similar approach on how they plan to reduce homelessness, but disagreed on who is best equipped to tackle the problem, as well as the effectiveness of ongoing initiatives. Crear said he has done the most to mitigate homelessness in the city, pointing to initiatives such asVegas Strongerand theCatholic Charitieshomeless shelter, both of which are headquartered in his ward, as well as the expansion ofHaven for Hope. Crear and Seaman also defended their votes in support of acontroversial 2019 banon homeless encampments in downtown Las Vegas. Seaman said she was hearing from business owners who were looking to close because of the unhoused population in the area, but that she would not have supported the ordinance if it did not also include efforts to provide shelter and wraparound care. Berkley said she has heard consistently from leaders of homelessness groups that the city council is not doing enough on the issue. She applauded some of the existing programs and credited the Legislature for abillpassed last year that allocates $100 million to a matching fund for homeless services, whichadvocates worriedwould not be sustainable. She said she would like to see a new Las Vegas campus for wraparound support for unhoused people beyond its existingopen-air courtyardwhere people experiencing homelessness can stay overnight While the Las Vegas mayor has no official oversight of the Clark County School District (CCSD), the candidates agreed it is important for the city to invest in education programs but differed in their overall perspective of the district. Seaman said she thinks CCSD has failed and that it should be broken up into smaller districts because students in rural communities such as Mesquite don’t have the same needs as those in Summerlin. She also said she supported a provision inAB400, which passed the Legislature last year, that allows cities to apply to sponsor charter schools. Berkley did not answer whether she thought the school system had failed and said she was proud to be a graduate of CCSD, which Seaman quipped was “a long time ago.” She said the city should do whatever it can to supplement the school district, including offering additional after-school and summer programs. Crear also did not answer whether he thinks CCSD has failed but pointed to city programs, such asYouth Development and Social Initiativesand amobile prekindergarten program, and said that the city should expand its support of students. The candidates also explained which type of affordable developments they prefer. Seaman said she prefers mixed-use development, a type of development that could combine housing and commercial purposes. Berkley said there is a “serious supply and demand problem” in city housing, with more people needing affordable homes than there are available. She said she supports Gov. Joe Lombardo’spushto free up federal land for affordable housing, adding that the city should look at providing different types of housing, such as tiny homes, depending on a person’s needs. Crear touted the opening of housing developments in his district, including the recentgroundbreakingof a 104-unit complex in the Historic Westside. He also emphasized that new housing construction should be done vertically so that neighborhoods aren’t “inundated” with additional housing. The three candidates all expressed an openness for a health care facility to move to theCashman Complexin downtown Las Vegas. While Crear did not say what type of facility should move to Cashman, a baseball stadium and event center that is being considered for redevelopment, he said some options might be sports and public health. Seaman said she wants to see a children’s hospital move to Cashman, while Berkley also said health care should be prioritized, even hinting that one hospital system is interested in moving its operations to that location, though she declined to provide more specifics. Berkley also said the deteriorating Grant Sawyer State Office Building should be imploded, but didn’t say what should take its place. Crear said he thinks the building will be sold, and Seaman said she would talk to Crear because the building is in his district. The candidates were all complimentary ofthe Goodmansand said it is important for an experienced hand to hold the mayoral seat. Crear did not answer whether there was anything he would have done differently from the Goodmans in the past 25 years. Seaman said she would have handled the Badlands settlement talks differently. Berkley said she would not have taken the same approach in a now-infamousCNN interviewthat Carolyn Goodman held at the start of the pandemic, where she offered the city as a “control group” for the virus. The candidates also all defended their long political careers, saying the next Las Vegas mayor should have political experience. Ralston noted that Oscar Goodman was a political newcomer when he took office. Berkley said she hasn’t heard a “new and visionary idea” from the more than a dozen other candidates in the field, so her experience makes her more qualified. Seaman also said it is time for “new blood” in the mayor’s office, and that she represents a new voice, even though she already works in city politics. Crear added that it would be “very irresponsible” to elect someone without city hall experience, an apparent dig at Berkley. Berkley was the only candidate to acknowledge regret over a former vote they cast, saying she should not have voted in support of the U.S. invading Iraq in 2003. Berkley and Crear said they would be supporting President Joe Biden in the November election, while Seaman said she would back former President Donald Trump One thing the candidates agreed on? They opposed ranked-choice voting, which will be on the ballot in November in the form of Question 3.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/culinary-union-un-endorses-17-lawmakers-running-for-re-election-over-room-cleaning-bill,True,"The Culinary Workers Union 226 has un-endorsed every sitting legislator who voted in favor of a 2023 resort-backed bill removing pandemic-imposed requirements placed on the casino industry, including the daily cleaning of hotel rooms. The Tuesday announcement means the union has decided to not endorse 18 Democratic lawmakers who are running in 2024 that the union previously endorsed in 2022, including Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) and Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas). Aside from backing challengers against a few incumbents so far, it marks the most public split yet between legislative Democrats and the union widely considered to be one of the most politically powerful in Nevada, which has beencreditedfor helping national and state Democrats win contentious races in past election cycles through its widespread canvassing efforts and political operation. “During the 2023 Nevada Legislature, a number of state legislative Democrats joined all Republicans and voted to repeal daily room cleaning,” thepress releasestated. “SB441 was signed into law by Governor Lombardo and hurt guest room attendants and our jobs.” The press release added that the union will “re-evaluate all endorsements ahead of the November general election.” The union is also backing candidates running against legislative caucus-backed candidates in various competitive Democratic primaries, including Reno Councilwoman Naomi Duerr, who is facing caucus-endorsed Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno) in Northern Nevada’s Senate District 15. The union also un-endorsed Assemblywoman Shannon Bilbray-Axelrod (D-Las Vegas), who is running for a seat on the Clark County Commission. The bill in question,SB441, passed out of both houses of the Democrat-controlled Legislature, with support from all Republican lawmakers, 10 Democrats in the Senate and 19 Democrats in the Assembly despite fervent opposition from the Culinary Union, which said that daily room cleaning “was standard practice” in Las Vegas before the pandemic and that it’s “good policy.” “Protecting daily room cleaning means protecting workers, protecting Las Vegas’ image and protecting hotel customers,” Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorgesaid during the legislative session. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo signed the bill in mid-May — though many of the union’srecent contractswith major Nevada casinos include provisions similar to language repealed by SB441. Tuesday’s list of endorsements and un-endorsements followed the union’s March announcement that it would support a primary candidate (nurse practitioner Geoconda Hughes, the daughter of a former union leader) against Sen. Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas) because Nguyen had helped present the bill. Despite Culinary backing a different candidate, other unions have supported Nguyen, including the Clark County Education Association (CCEA) and the Las Vegas branches of the Service Employees International Union, Laborers Union (which represents construction workers) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. John Vellardita, the executive director of CCEA,toldThe Nevada Independentin early Maythat Culinary’s decision to put up a primary challenger is based on his belief that the union is “a political force that’s in decline.” “The Culinary didn't get what it wanted in this last legislative session, so they're going after the majority leader's leadership team,” he said at the time.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-jewish-voters-could-factor-into-nevadas-toss-up-senate-race,True,"When Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY)called onIsrael to host new elections and criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as having “lost his way” in March, Sam Brown, the Republican front-runner to take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), was quick to tie his opponent to her party leader’s rhetoric. “It takes courage to be a leader — to stand up for what’s right even in the face of criticism from your own party,” Brownwrote on X. “Jacky Rosen has shown she’s unwilling to take a stand and be a leader.” Rosen toldJewish Insiderlater that day thatshedisagreedwith Schumer. But Brown has continued to proclaim hissupportfor Israel andconcernoverrising domestic antisemitism, joining a chorus of Republican candidates nationwide who havecontinually attackedDemocrats over pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, arguing that the left is enabling chaos and mistreatment of Jewish students. Brown’s strategy vis a vis Israel is standard for Republicans in 2024, but the dynamic in Nevada is complicated by Rosen’s position as the only Jewish woman in the Senate and as a former synagogue president. Rosen’s faith has been acore tenetof her political identity since she first announced she was running for the House in 2016, sayingshe was inspiredto run by the Jewish principle oftikkun olam, or repairing the world — a phrase that still crops up frequently in herfundraisingappeals. An otherwise under-the-radar first-termer, Rosen’s reputation as a staunch supporter of Israel is among her best-known qualities nationally. She wasone of five senatorsto travel to the Jewish state in the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack and has maintained that aid to Israel should be unconditional — even as fellow Democratic senators have begun to question Israel’s approach to the war in Gaza. While Rosen has been supportive of funding and delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza, neither Brown’s nor Rosen’s approach to Israel is representative of voters who believeIsrael’s treatment of civiliansis inhumane and violating global human rights standards — a group that includes some Jewish voters, even if they are a minority. Polling of American Jewsaffirmsthat majorities do feel close to Israel, but sometimes find it difficult to support the actions of its government. As thefounderand co-chair of the Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism, Rosen has long been engaged on the issue, includingintroducing new legislationin April to create a White House-level position focused on implementing the administration’s strategy to fight antisemitism. She wasquick to denouncecampus protests as well. If Brown is the nominee — by no means guaranteed amid a crowded GOP primary that includes Jeff Gunter, a former ambassador who has spent millions on television ads and is Jewish himself — Rosen’s Jewish identity and legislative record create a unique dilemma: How does he win over Jewish voters — already a difficult task given their status as one of the mostconsistently liberal identity groupsin the U.S. — when their current senator shares their faith? “This is an issue that needs to be approached with respect and acknowledg[ment] that Sen. Rosen is working to try and be a leader and an ambassador for the community,” Brown said in an interview withThe Nevada Independenton Monday. “But my concern [is] that there's a difference between saying something and doing something.” As an example, Brown cited Rosenvoting with allSenate Democrats in November to table House Republicans’ Israel aid bill, which would have funded security assistance to Israel — but not Ukraine or other White House priorities — as well as cut funding for the Internal Revenue Service. Democratsrejectedthat approach over fears that funding Israel on its own would imperil any future Ukraine assistance and that attaching IRS cuts amounted to conditioning the aid. Rosenvotedfor a bill with both Ukraine and Israel funding in December, but Senate Republicans blocked that effort. Brown said Rosen’s approach in that instance favored partisan loyalty. “That's concerning and confusing for me [as to] why that sort of thing occurs,” he said. “Why, seemingly, does partisan politics end up defining the result of a vote like that, as opposed to what's right?” Ultimately, the Senatepasseda national security package that included $26 billion for Israel in late April, which Rosen voted for. Brown has not said how he would have voted on that particular bill, but he has beencriticalof Ukraine funding. Rosen’s campaign pointed out that the senator has stood up to members of her party in defense of Israel,including the president, and listed 30 actions she’s taken in the Senate to support Israel and push back against antisemitism, including screening footage of the Oct. 7 attack for fellow senators, launching the Senate Abraham Accords Caucus and introducing multiple pieces of legislation expanding Holocaust education. “As the only Jewish woman and former synagogue president serving in the Senate, Senator Rosen has never shied away from how her faith has shaped her values, her strong support for Israel, and her opposition to antisemitic hate,” a Rosen spokesperson said in a statement. “Senator Rosen takes a back seat to no one when it comes to her ironclad support for Israel’s right to defend herself and an unbreakable U.S.-Israel relationship, even when it means standing up to her own party.” Nevada’s Jewish voting trends Jewish voters made up about 3 percent of the Nevada electorate in 2020, according toexit polls, and supported then-candidate Joe Biden by a margin of 76 percent to Donald Trump’s 22 percent. In a state where the Jewish population, though small, is larger than the margin that Democrats have won recent elections by, Republicans’ goal is not to outright win the Jewish vote but instead make a dent in the typically lopsided figure. AMonday poll of registered Nevada voters fromThe New York Timessuggested Republicans may be onto something. Though only 2 percent of polled voters identified Israel and the Middle East as their top issue, when asked who they trust more on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 52 percent of voters said they preferred Trump, with only 32 percent picking Biden. Sam Markstein, the political director for the Republican Jewish Coalition, acknowledged that Rosen has a record of supporting Israel, but said that the “D” next to her name on the ballot might speak louder to voters. “You can't hide from the divisions in the Democratic Party, and that's what she's trying to do,” Markstein said. “Her inability to speak in a forthright way reflects that the Democratic Party is in fact tearing itself apart over these issues of antisemitism and the war in the Middle East.” A successful Republican candidate, Markstein said, will call out Rosen for not going to UNLV to denounce protesters the way Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Republicans did at Columbia University. Students have protested in support of Palestinians atUNLVandUNR, but neither school has contended with encampments or police violence like other universities have. Rosen has been actively attempting to combat antisemitism on college campuses through her role in the Senate. She’surgedthe Department of Education toget involvedand called on Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) tohost hearingson the issue in the education committee he chairs. On the Democratic side, allies think Rosen’s actions over the past year have only strengthened her position among Nevada’s Jewish voters. Margy Feldman, the Nevada chapter lead of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said Brown is “barking up the wrong tree” if he thinks he can use Israel as a wedge issue to peel off Jewish support in Nevada. While state-specific data about partisanship among Jewish voters is lacking, Feldman said that anecdotally, she believes Nevada has a higher percentage of Jewish Republicans than other states because of the late Sheldon Adelson’s longtime Republican activity in the state. Rosen’s positions on issues of domestic antisemitism, in particular, could push even more Jewish Nevada voters towards her, Feldman said. “[I] think about waking up right after Oct. 7 [and] seeing my senator in Israel, and thenbeing rushedto a bomb shelter,” Feldman said. “She's so proud of who she is and who we are, that I actually think it might go the other way.” And it’s not just Democrats who appreciate Rosen’s efforts. Republican political consultant Elliot Malin, who is Jewish, said that Rosen is even more active than Schumer, the highest- ranking Jewish official in U.S. history, on issues such as Holocaust education and combating antisemitism. While he believes frustration over rising antisemitism might affect the presidential race, he does not believe Brown’s rhetoric will resonate. “The Jewish community knows her and knows what she's doing and knows how vocal she is,” Malin said. Rosen’s campaign efforts will be aided by groups like Feldman’s and the state Democratic Party, which has a dedicated Jewish Caucus. On the Republican side, the RJC has proven asignificantspenderin past cycles through its super PAC and has chapters in Nevada, creating a landing place for Republican Jewish activism that other minority groupslackin the GOP. One complicating factor — Feldman and the RJC’s Markstein’s predictions for the Jewish vote are assuming voters also support Israel to the same extent. For Nevadans — Jewish or otherwise — who oppose Israel’s conduct in the war and believe sanctions are appropriate, there may not be a mainstream candidate in the Senate race who they feel speaks for them. In theNYTpoll, 36 percent of registered Nevada voters sympathized more with Israel, 27 percent said they sympathized more with Palestinians than Israelis and an additional 19 percent weighed both sides equally. Sympathy for Palestinians was higher among younger voters and minority voters — groups that make up significant chunks of the Democratic electorate.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/biden-campaign-asks-court-to-dismiss-gop-lawsuit-challenging-nevada-mail-ballot-deadline,True,"The Biden campaign is getting involved in another Nevada election lawsuit, challenging the legal merit and intent of a Republican effort to object to the deadline for how long mail ballots can be accepted after Election Day in the Silver State. The Republican National Committee (RNC), the Donald Trump campaign and the Nevada GOPfiled suitin early May challenging the state’s law permitting the acceptance of mail ballots up to four business days after polls close, so long as the ballots are postmarked before Election Day. The RNC alleges that the practice does not conform with the federally established deadline of Election Day. In a motion to dismiss the case filed Monday and shared withThe Nevada Independent, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), with the support of the Biden campaign,note thatNevada is one of several states that have such a policy, which has beenheld uparound the country in other court challenges. This is the Biden campaign’s second legal challenge to Republican lawsuits of the cycle; earlier this month, itfiledan amicus brief to support the Nevada secretary of state after the RNCsuedthe state over alleged inconsistencies in counties’ voter rolls. In both legal filings, the Biden campaign argued that the Republican lawsuits are legally unserious and an effort to undermine confidence in the electoral process before it begins. “Just like in every lawsuit in every state, we will fight these efforts to sow distrust and defend the right to free and fair elections by defeating Republicans in court and Donald Trump at the ballot box,” Biden campaign national spokesperson Charles Lutvak said in a statement toThe Nevada Independent. In addition to the motion to dismiss, the Biden campaign is also filing a motion to intervene, which would allow them to be a party to the case filed in federal court. Two Democratic-aligned groups representing veterans and retireesfiled a motionto intervene in the suit as well on Friday. Democrats argue in the legal filing that statutes allowing the collection of mail ballots received after Election Day have a long precedent nationally. Any finding against the law would disenfranchise Nevadans, they argue. “Plaintiffs contend that states cannot count ballots that are mailed on or before election day, and arrive in the mail shortly after election day, because this would purportedly violate federal laws establishing a uniform national election day,” the motion reads. “Every court that has considered this claim has rejected it, and this Court should do the same.”",Error: Connection error.

Legal status: Signature-gathering status: The Nevada Secretary of State's Office announced on June 28 that petition supporters had gathered enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. Financial status: Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom raised $1.4 million in thefirst three monthsof 2024. The haul included donations from left-leaning “dark money” nonprofits that do not have to disclose their donors, including $500,000 from the Nevada Alliance and $500,000 from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, which spentnearly $800 millionon progressive causes from 2020 to 2022. The group spent more than $2 million last quarter, mostly on consulting. The PAC also raised $1.8 millionlast year, which included a $1 million donation from a nonprofit led by Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. What it would do: Theproposalfrom theRepair the Vote PACwould require all in-person voters in Nevada to present a valid photo identification — such as a driver’s license, passport, student photo ID card or concealed weapon permit — before voting. The petition would also require those voting by mail to include part of a personally identifiable number — such as their driver’s license number or Social Security number — alongside their signature. Legal status: The Nevada Supreme Courtblockeda legal challenge to the petition on May 24, clearing the way for the measure to continue on its path to the 2024 ballot. The decision upheld alower court’s February ruling. Attorneys behind the legal challenge — who typically represent Democrat-backed causes —argued the proposalwas akin to an unconstitutional poll tax because it would require people voting in person to pay to receive a valid form of identification. They also argued that providing a free form of identification would cost state funds, and the petition did not outline a source for that funding, as is required in the Constitution. The Supreme Court justices said it was improper to rule on such matters before the election, deciding it could only rule on procedural questions, such as the petition’s description of effect. Signature-gathering status: Repair the Vote announced on June 24 that it had gathered and submitted more than 179,000 signatures, well more than the roughly 102,000 threshold supporters needed to qualify for the ballot. County officials have 13 days to validate the submitted signatures. Financial status: Repair the Vote received$100,000in the first quarter of 2024, all from Henderson resident Allen Knudson, the president of a mortgage banking company. The political apparatus of Gov. Joe Lombardo, who pushed for a voter IDbilllast year that stalled in the Democrat-controlled Legislature, has also connected the group to a benefactor who will help fund the campaign and pay signature gatherers, Gibbs said. The group plans to have more than 100 paid signature gatherers. What it would do: Thepetition, led by aPACaffiliated with the Clark County Education Association (CCEA), would give licensed public school educators in Nevada the legal right to strike, which is currently illegal for all government employees under state law. Legal status: There are no active legal challenges, CCEA Executive Director John Vellardita toldThe Indyon May 7, and the deadline has passed for any lawsuit to be filed. Signature-gathering status: Vellardita said that the group is “well on our way to have enough signatures by early summer.” He declined to provide an exact total on the number of signatures gathered. Financial status: CCEA contributed$2 millionto the PAC supporting the petition in the first quarter, by far the union’s largest donations related to a ballot initiative. What it would do: Stop Predatory Lending NV, a nonprofit formed this year by Democratic strategists, has filed two separate petitions to rein in the use of high-interest lending in Nevada. Both petitions called for imposing a 36 percent cap on the interest rates for certain types of high-interest loans, includingtitle loansandpayday loans, which are short-term loans where individuals typically receive immediate cash and agree to pay back the loan (typically with a high rate of interest) within a short period of time. Thefirstpetition also included language to increase how much money from a person’s bank account and weekly wages is protected from a seizure for an unpaid debt, but thesecondpetition does not include that language. Legal status: In March, a Carson City judgerejectedthe first petition because it was too broad, a decision that wasupheldby the state Supreme Court in June. The same district court judge approved the narrower petition, which is pending an appeal in the state Supreme Court. Signature-gathering status: Peter Koltak, a spokesperson for Stop Predatory Lending, would not disclose on May 9 how many signatures have been gathered, or which petition version the group is focusing on during signature-gathering, but said the group did not have any concerns about meeting the Nov. 20 deadline. The group was barred from collecting signatures on the broader petition after the lower court’s dismissal. Financial status: Stop Predatory Lending raised $260,000 in the first quarter of 2024, all from left-leaning “dark money” groups. Nevadans for Financial Choice raised$290,000in the first quarter, with donations from lending companies including Dollar Loan Center ($50,000), Checksmart Financial ($50,000) and Moneytree ($25,000). What it would do: Thepetition, which is backed by Uber, seeks tocap attorney feesin civil cases at 20 percent of all settlements and awards beginning in 2027. The initiative would not place a limit on how much money plaintiffs can recover from lawsuits. Attorney fees in civil cases are largely unregulated in Nevada, except that they must be considered reasonable, and fees in medical malpractice cases are capped at 35 percent of the total recovery. Only two other states have adopted similar caps on attorney fees in civil cases: Oklahoma and Michigan, though both are less stringent than the Nevada petition. Legal status: A Nevada trial lawyers groupsuedto block the petition in April, arguing that the petition fails to inform supporters of its full implications. A judgedismissedthe lawsuit on May 10. The suit argued that the petition is designed to stymie sexual misconduct lawsuits that Uber is facing, and contends that the cap on attorney fees would make it harder for Nevadans to find the best lawyers to take on their cases. The ruling wasappealedto the Nevada Supreme Court in early June. Signature-gathering status: An official with Nevadans for Fair Recovery (the group behind the petition) declined to provide information on signatures gathered. Financial status: In the first quarter, Uber gave$4 millionto Nevadans for Fair Recovery, which did not spend any of the money during the quarter. It’s by far the largest single political donation in Nevada by the ride-sharing company, topping its previous high of $25,000 in 2018. Citizens for Justice — the political arm of the Nevada Justice Association (the trial lawyers group suing to block the petition) —raisedmore than $330,000 in the first quarter, though it’s unclear how much (if any) related to this petition. What it would have done: Thepetition— brought by a PAC affiliated with the Nevada State Education Association (NSEA) — sought to overturn the public financing deal approved by the Nevada Legislature in 2023 to help fund construction of a Las Vegas baseball stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics. Reason for disqualification: The Nevada Supreme Court on May 13 affirmed a lower court’s November decision toblockthe petition. A Carson City judge had ruled it did not meet the state’s requirements for including the petition’s full text on signature-gathering forms and that its description of effect — a 200-word summary of the measure that appears on collection forms — did not fully explain the measure’s implications. Signature-gathering status: Alexander Marks, a spokesperson for Schools Over Stadiums, toldThe IndyonMay 7 that no matter the Supreme Court’s ruling, the group will likely try to place a referendum on the 2026 ballot because of the fast-approaching deadline to qualify for this year’s ballot — which now must be through a revised petition because of the high court’s ruling. Financial status: Schools over Stadiumsreported raising$3,000 in the first quarter of 2024, all from California donors, and spent $23,000 on the law firm representing the PAC before the state Supreme Court. The group also held a fundraiser on the final day of the first quarter (that included a donor’s commitment to give $100,000 in matching funds), but the PAC did not officially receive the money until the reporting period closed, a PAC representative toldThe Indy. PACs are not legally required to report their cash on hand amount or donations less than $1,000. A PAC official said in April that its average donation was $91.67, and that the group had around $161,000 in cash on hand as of the end of March. What it would have done: Fair Maps Nevada, a group that for years has tried to change the state’s redistricting process,filed two petitions in Novemberseeking to create an independent redistricting commission, a proposal opposed by Democrats who currently control the redistricting process. Reason for disqualification: The Nevada Supreme Courtstruck downthe effort on May 10, agreeing with a lower court’s ruling that both petitions would create an unconstitutional unfunded mandate by establishing a new commission without creating a mechanism to fund it. Updated on 5/13/24 to add the disqualification of the A’s stadium referendum, on 5/20/24 to add that Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom announced it had collected more than 200,000 signatures for its ballot petition as of May 20, on 5/28/24 to include the state Supreme Court's approval of the voter ID petition, on 6/17/24 at 12 p.m. to include the appeal of the lawyer fees petition, on 6/24/24 to add the Supreme Court's dismissal of the broader payday loan petition, on 6/25/24 to add information on signatures gathered on the voter ID initiative and on 6/28/24 to include the qualification of the abortion ballot question.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-supreme-court-weighs-whether-proposed-voter-id-ballot-measure-amounts-to-poll-tax,True,"The Nevada Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on the legality of a proposed ballot measure to require voter identification, after a lower courtdismissed a lawsuitchallenging it in February. The appellant — represented by a group of Nevada and Washington, D.C.-based attorneys who typically represent Democrat-backed causes — argues that the petition would cost money while not explicitly outlining a funding source, which would be unconstitutional. Voter ID proposals are favored inside and outside of Nevada by Republicans, who say they are necessary to ensure election security, but the proposals have failed to gain momentum in the Democrat-controlled Legislature. The hearing comes less than two months before the deadline for petition supporters to gather and submit enough signatures for the measure to qualify for the November ballot. So far, supporters have received about  60,000 signatures, according to David Gibbs, the head of the Repair the Vote PAC behind the effort. To make it on the ballot, petition supporters still must gather 102,362 signatures from voters by June 26, with at least 25,591 signatures coming from each of the state’s four congressional districts. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo's political apparatus has connected the PAC to a benefactor who is helping fund the campaign and will pay people for signature gathering efforts, said Gibbs, a former chair of the Clark County GOP. The PAC plans to have more than 100 paid signature gatherers within the next week, he added. Ryan Erwin, Lombardo’s top political strategist, did not respond to a request for more information. The PAC reported raising $100,000 in the first quarter of 2024, all from a single donor — Allen Knudson, president of a Henderson-based mortgage banking company. The proposal, filed last November, seeks to amend the Nevada Constitution by requiring each in-person voter to provide a valid form of photo identification before receiving their ballot. That can include a driver’s license, passport, student photo ID card or concealed weapon permit. The proposal would also require everyone voting by mail to include part of a personally identifiable number — such as a Social Security number or driver’s license number — alongside their signature. The legal challengewas brought in Decemberby Jennifer Fleischmann, the development director for the progressive immigrant advocacy group Make the Road Nevada. Arguments David Fox, one of Fleischmann’s lawyers, argued Wednesday that the proposal is similar to a poll tax, which is illegal under the federal Constitution, because it would require in-person voters to provide forms of identification that costmoney to obtain. He added that the question would require the Legislature to provide a funding source for free identification, making the framing unconstitutional as no such funding source is included in the ballot question’s language. Justice Patricia Lee questioned attorneys for Repair the Vote, the pro-voter ID group, if it was indeed a poll tax. “[If] I don't have a driver's license or any of the forms of IDs enumerated in the proposed rule change or the constitutional change, and then I have to go to DMV, then who's going to pay for my ID?” Lee asked. “How is that not a poll tax? I have to pay to vote.” Repair the Vote’s counsel, Reno lawyer David O’Mara, responded by saying that even if the petition succeeds, a prospective voter would not be required to pay money to vote, an apparent reference to the option of providing part of a Social Security number to vote by mail. He also referred to voter ID cases in other states, although many of those cases involved voter ID requirements with more lenient rules about valid forms of ID. “In Nevada, you don’t have to pay anything to vote. You get a ballot if you’re registered,” O’Mara said. “There is no specific [precedent from other states] that says that having to pay for anything is a specific poll tax.” Chief Justice Elissa Cadish questioned whether the court’s task to determine if a poll tax existed was “excessively speculative” because the proposal itself does not call for the allocation of funding that could make obtaining an ID free. Fox responded by saying the high court has conducted similar analyses in the past. Wednesday’s hearing also included a discussion of the constitutionality of the proposal’s“description of effect,”a 47-word description included on signature gathering forms that is required to explain the implications of the ballot question. Justice Lidia Stiglich questioned the clarity of the description, saying it was not abundantly clear in the description that people would not be allowed to vote in person unless they have a photo ID. O’Mara argued that the description was “a summary of what's going to happen,” and that the main implication of the proposal is amending the state Constitution, which is outlined in the petition’s description. Fox, however, argued that the description did not explain all of the measure’s implications, including the forms of accepted ID and the funding source for the proposal. If the initiative survives the legal challenge, lands on the ballot and receives support from a majority of voters, it would again be placed on the 2026 ballot, when another affirmative vote would amend the state Constitution. The ballot initiative mirrors abillpushed by Lombardo last year that stalled in the Democrat-controlled Legislature. The effort has received public support from former President Donald Trump, whoencouragedNevadans in February to sign the petition. This marks the second time Repair the Vote has tried to place a voter ID ballot measure before voters. In 2022, ajudge orderedthe group to rewrite its “description of effect” because it was argumentative, which the group ultimately never did. ANevada Independentpollof 800 likely voters last year found that 74 percent supported voter identification.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/after-restructuring-is-nevada-ranked-choice-ballot-measure-ready-for-election,True,"Flush with cash from wealthy outside donors, Nevada Voters First conducted an expansive media campaign in 2022 on behalf of Question 3, a ballot measure that would fundamentally change Nevada’s election system by allowing all voters to participate in primaries regardless of party affiliation and implement ranked-choice voting in general elections. The group, which alsogarnered financial supportfrom the Realtors, a teachers union and the gaming industry, ran myriaddigital and television adsand poured millions of dollars into supporting the proposal, which qualified for the ballot. It passed with the support of about 53 percent of voters that year, despiteopposition from prominent elected leadersof both major parties. But as Question 3 returns to voters this year for the second and final time, it has reported only one significant contribution while spending nearly $900,000 this cycle — more than four times what it has raised. Grassroots supporters of the measure also say they haven't seen much activity from the group in the past year and a half and were unfamiliar with its strategies this year. Clues to the ballot measure’s future may lie in a quiet reorganization. As the PAC’s bank account drained, organizers registered a new PAC,Vote Yes on 3, Inc., with the secretary of state’s office on March 15, and prebooked a nearly eight-figure ad buy ahead of the 2024 general election. “Question 3 hadn’t, yet, been assigned to the initiative by the state when Nevada Voters First was formed, so moving forward everything will be branded ‘Vote Yes on 3’ for the 2024 campaign,” representatives of the new PAC said in a statement provided toThe Nevada Independent. In the statement, representatives added that the high spending levels from the original Nevada Voters First PAC were for expenses incurred during the 2022 election and that the new Vote Yes on 3 PAC will be the primary fundraising and campaign entity moving forward. Data from the political ad-tracking organization AdImpact indicates that the new PAC prebooked more than $9.4 million in ad buys in Las Vegas, Reno and on satellite from Sept. 10 through Election Day. Prebooking, however, doesn’t require the ad buyer to pay any money up front and the size of the ad booking can change at any point up to the scheduled start date. It’s unclear how much funding the new PAC has available because Nevada law does not require PACs to report their cash on hand. Unlike candidates for office, Nevada PACs can accept unlimited amounts of money from a single donor. It’s common for groups supporting ballot questions to remain somewhat dormant in non-election years. Jeremy Gelman, an associate professor of political science at UNR, said that it’s possible that organizers are maneuvering behind the scenes to close out the PAC's old books before moving to the new PAC. “As long as the donors have a legal spending vehicle to use, there is no real disadvantage to changing to the new PAC,” Gelman said. “Switching to a new PAC at this stage, assuming it isn’t a signal of discord among Question 3’s main backers, is not a major change in how this advocacy campaign will unfold over the next 6 months.” Protect Your Vote Nevada, a Democrat-linked PAC opposing the initiative, has also not reported raising any money since the 2022 election. The group spent around $150,000 last year after spending $2.2 million of the roughly $2.4 million it raised in 2022. “It barely passed in 2022, Nevadans are right to be skeptical of it, and we are planning to run a campaign to beat it,” said Peter Koltak, a strategist with Protect Your Vote Nevada. Sondra Cosgrove, a professor at the College of Southern Nevada who has advocated for the measure in a volunteer capacity, said she was concerned about the lack of engagement from supporters of the ballot question since 2022. The pro-Question 3 PAC’sFacebookandXaccounts have not made any new posts since 2022. “We just said, ‘OK, well, the grassroots is going to keep talking about this, we'll maybe catch back up with you in the summer of 2024,’” said Cosgrove, who also leads the civic engagement nonprofitVote Nevada. “Since then, we really have not heard anything from the official campaign, from the funders. It's kind of just been a black box.” How it would work Question 3, which aims to amend the Nevada Constitution, would require most partisan elections in Nevada to move to a ranked-choice voting system. It would exclude the presidential election but include U.S. Senate and congressional races, legislative elections and statewide office positions. If passed, primary elections in the state would open up to all voters regardless of party registration starting in 2026, with the top five vote-getters advancing to the general election, where voters would rank candidates by order of preference. Voters could mark up to five preferences among candidates but could also choose to rank only one candidate or any number under five. Votes for “none of these candidates” would be required to be calculated, reported and made public but would not be counted to elect or rank any candidates for partisan office. The biggest backer of Question 3 is Katherine Gehl, a Wisconsin-based businesswoman andfounder of a nonprofitthat promotes “Final-Five Voting,” the combined open primary and ranked choice voting system contained in Nevada’s ballot initiative. Gehl was thelargest single donorto the pro-Question 3 PAC ahead of the 2022 election. Representatives of the nonprofit did not respond to an email requesting an interview about whether it was still involved in the ballot measure effort. Supporters say the system would allow more voters to participate in the electoral process, especially as nonpartisan votersmake up the single largest groupof registered voters in the Silver State, and make it harder for candidates with extreme positions to succeed. The state’s Republican and Democratic parties have vehemently opposed the initiative, arguing it will confuse voters, be time-consuming and could lead to errors that result in eligible votes being thrown out. Apoll conductedlast year by the Guinn Center, a policy-focused nonprofit research group, indicates that many Nevada voters “lack awareness or understanding of the proposed reform and its impacts.” Specifically, the poll found that even after reading a sample ballot explanation of the Question 3 measure, 37 percent of respondents answered, “I don’t know” to a question about their opinion on the reform. A plurality of therespondents(41 percent) indicated that they support Question 3, whereas 22 percent indicated they wouldn’t support it. The Guinn Center noted in its report that younger voters are generally more supportive of ranked-choice voting than older voters, and Democrats are more likely to support the voting method than Republicans. Exploring the finances Nevada Voters First has reported one contribution of more than $1,000 since the 2022 election, a roughly $207,000 donation in August 2023 from Unite America, a Denver-based group that supports nonpartisan election reform, including open primaries. The group (Gehl wasa board member) helpedshepherdmillions of dollars to the PAC in the 2022 cycle. Unite America did not respond to a question about its future spending plans for the ballot question. The lack of contributions so far this election cycle marks a significant change from two years ago, when the PAC was first formed andhad to begincollecting tens of thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot whilefending off legal challenges. In the first quarter of 2022, Nevada Voters First raised more than $2.25 million from more than a dozen donors, including a national group promoting ranked choice voting and several in-state groups, including the Nevada Association of Realtors, a PAC associated with the Clark County Education Association and Wynn Resorts. Nevada Voters First has spent more than $800,000 this election cycle, mostly on consulting. It paid $240,000 to Winner & Mandabach Campaigns, a national consulting group focused on ballot initiatives. The PAC also paid more than $175,000 to Argentum Partners, a Las Vegas government affairs firm, for fees related to consulting, advertising, office expenses and special events. The PAC also spent around $70,000 on polling from FM3 Research, a California-based group focused on surveys of candidates and ballot measures. Officials with the new Vote Yes on 3 PAC did not file a campaign finance report for the first quarter of 2024.Under state law, a PAC is not required to file a report if it raised less than $1,000 or did not spend money supporting or opposing a candidate or group of candidates. The PAC was created just two weeks before the end of the reporting deadline — the next quarterly campaign finance reports are not due until July 15. The Democrat-linked PAC opposing the ballot initiative has not reported raising any money this election cycle, but it has spent significantly less than Nevada Voters First. What happens next? Cosgrove said she was never on the campaign’s payroll but attended meetings with the group and helped organize support for the ballot measure. After the ballot measure passed in 2022, she said the Question 3 organization let its campaign manager go, and “became very different.” Cosgrove said that the campaign told her and others that it would not do any advocacy during the 2023 legislative session and would re-engage with voters in the summer of 2024. The creation of a new PAC came as a surprise, Cosgrove said, adding that she has “a lot of concerns” about the lack of grassroots engagement and worries broadly about the influence of outside funders and consultants in ballot measure campaigns (the president of the newly registered PAC, Neal Levine, is a former Nevada resident based in New York). Still, she said she and other volunteers have shared information about ranked-choice voting through presentations and community engagement efforts. Levine, who isconsideredan expert on cannabis policy, ballot initiatives and independent expenditure campaigns, was previously involved in the cannabis legalization campaigns in Nevada. He declined an interview request. She said she’d like to see more money spent on voter education about the ranked-choice process and in spreading awareness about the ballot question. “I'm hoping that the official campaign reaches back out to us so we can maybe do a debrief as to what we've been doing for the last 18 months,” Cosgrove said, so the new group isn’t “sprinkling advertising all over the place that maybe doesn't align with what we're hearing.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/aclu-suing-elko-county-over-compliance-with-jail-voting-law,True,"The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nevada is suing Elko County, alleging the county has not complied with a new law requiring jails to facilitate voting for detainees who are eligible to cast a ballot. The lawsuit, filed Monday in Elko District Court, alleges that the Elko County Sheriff’s Office has failed to comply with nine provisions of the 2023 law, including ensuring the secrecy of detainees’ ballots, guaranteeing that detainees can vote without intimidation and outlining a process for same-day voter registration. AB286, which passed the Legislature with near-unanimous support last year (three Republicans opposed the measure) and went into effect Jan. 1, requires all county or city jails in the state to explicitly update their policies to allow any eligible detained people to register or vote in an election. Nevadans who have been convicted of a felony and remain in prison cannot vote, while those serving time in local jails for misdemeanors or who are detained awaiting a verdict have the right to vote if they are otherwise eligible. The ACLU said in the lawsuit that Elko’s noncompliance amounts to voter disenfranchisement, and requested the court force the county to comply. “[T]he continued imposition of barriers to registering to vote and voting for individuals in custody will undoubtedly lead to the disfranchisement of detained eligible voters within its facility,” the lawsuit read. An Elko County official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit also alleges that Elko County did not respond to an ACLU demand letter sent last month that outlined the ways in which the ACLU believed Elko was not complying with the law. The group requested additional information within 11 days, or it  would pursue legal action. The letter was sent a month after the ACLUthreatenedto sue any local jail not complying with the law, after the group had filed records requests to see if jails were complying and found that many were not. Elko County’s response to the records request referred to its policy from last September, which outlines all of the law’s provisions but did not outline the specific processes in place to ensure the law was being followed. The lawsuit said the response “merely reiterates the provisions of AB 286.” County officials also submitted a report to the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office following February’s presidential preference primary, which stated that no inmates registered to vote or voted in that election. The report included the same policy that the county had sent in response to the ACLU’s records request, but it also includes a new section outlining the county’s plan to allow detainee voting, such as two employees being in charge of registering detainees or updating their voter registration. The ACLU said that report does not show the facility’s processes for ensuring compliance with nine of the law’s provisions. In the February presidential preference primary, 23 people incarcerated at the Clark County Detention Center voted, while 26 Washoe County inmates voted and one Churchill County detainee participated, local officials told lawmakers in March.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/biden-campaign-alleges-rnc-using-nevada-lawsuits-to-sow-early-doubt-in-election,True,"The Biden campaign is filing an amicus brief Monday to support Nevada’s secretary of state in a lawsuit the Republican National Committeebrought against the stateover alleged inaccuracies in the voter rolls. As the RNC narrows in on Nevada, between the March lawsuit andone broughtwith the Trump campaign and the Nevada GOP in May challenging the period of time that the state allows mail ballots to be received after Election Day, the Biden campaign is trying to lay its own legal groundwork. Its lawyers are arguing that, beyond that the faulty argument they say the Republicans have made, the lawsuits are an attempt to sow doubt in the election months before it happens. ""This lawsuit is little more than political theater, designed less to address any real (much less substantial) issue with Nevada’s voter registration lists, than to sow public distrust in the security and integrity of our electoral systems,” the brief says. “It is no more than a continuation of Republicans’ 2020 efforts to undermine public confidence in our elections."" [Readmoreabout the RNC’s recent lawsuit here.] In 2020, the GOPfiledmore than 60 lawsuits attempting to challenge the results of the election in pivotal states where then-candidate Joe Biden beat then-President Donald Trump. All but one were defeated, cementing the fairness of the 2020 election. In Nevada, none prevailed, and the state’s Republican then-secretary of stateconcludedthere was no evidence of widespread election fraud. This cycle, the RNC and its allies, including the Nevada GOP, have begun the legal battle earlier, in Nevada and other swing states. In the March lawsuit, the RNC accused the state of violating voter law through improper roll maintenance, claiming that the number of voters on the rolls exceeded the eligible voting age population in several counties. In a statement, an RNC spokesperson did not respond to allegations that the lawsuits are part of a broader plan to undermine confidence in the election, and defended the voter roll lawsuit as a necessary step. “Nevada’s voter rolls are inaccurate — full stop,” the spokesperson said. “It speaks volumes that Democrats are laser-focused on stopping voter roll cleanup instead of solving any of the crises that have erupted on their watch.” The secretary of state’s office filed a motion to dismiss the suit; replies are due May 20. The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada and the Campaign Legal Center also announced Monday they willfile amicus briefsin the case supporting the secretary of state. The Biden campaign’s amicus brief backs up the Nevada secretary of state’s arguments in defense of the voter roll system but goes further, suggesting that the GOP is bringing flawed lawsuits in order to refer back to them if Trump loses in his rematch with Biden this year and convince voters before the election occurs that it will be unfair. In the brief, the Biden campaign reiterates points from the Nevada secretary of state’s filings, which fault the RNC for misinterpreting the National Voter Registration Act, the bill that governs how voter rolls must be maintained, and the differing pools of data that the secretary of state alleged the RNC pulled from to claim that the voter rolls were inflated. ""These circumstances make clear that this lawsuit is not meant to protect the integrity of upcoming elections, but instead to provide the RNC with ammunition to undermine the general election’s results,” the brief says. “Indeed, former President Trump is already asserting interference with the 2024 general election, months before a single vote has been cast or counted."" In recent interviews, Trumphas not committedto accepting the results of the election if he loses and said “it depends” on the fairness of the election as to whether there will be political violence afterwards. The goal of the brief, according to the campaign, is to ask the judge to dismiss the case swiftly, as the secretary of state has requested, as well as to identify for the court what they believe is the RNC’s ultimate goal of undermining confidence in the election. Doing so, the campaign hopes, will dissuade judges from hearing this and similar cases. “Our team is prepared and continuing the fight for democracy,” Charles Lutvak, a national spokesperson for Biden’s campaign, said in a statement. “We are defending the right to free and fair elections against Republicans’ junk lawsuits.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/most-nevada-gop-candidates-mum-on-election-integrity-after-big-lie-was-prominent-in-2022,True,"Two years ago, Republican Mark Robertson, a candidate for Nevada’s 1st Congressional District,said on his campaign websitethat the 2020 election had “raised legitimate concerns” about the nation’s electoral process. He called for a bipartisan congressional review into topics such as the “potential risks of extensive mail-in voting and extended voting periods.” This year, running again for the same seat, the Army veteran has changed his strategy. Hiscampaign websitedoes not mention “election security,” and he is encouraging voters to use any legal measure at their disposal to vote. In an interview, Robertson said he still has concerns about election integrity (there is no data that suggests widespread voter fraud exists inNevadaornationwide), but that Republicans should not be focusing on the issue in their campaign messaging because it could decrease voter turnout. “It's not a change in position, rather an emphasis on the communications,” he said. “I think it was a mistake two years ago for the Republicans to say the election was stolen … because what it did was it discouraged Republicans from voting.” The shift reflects the diminished role that election integrity is playing in this year’s Nevada races. Of the nearly 50 Republicans running for Congress or the Legislature this year with a legitimate chance of winning their primary or general election — based on recent fundraising hauls and district partisanship —The Nevada Independentidentified only nine active campaign websites with a section on election integrity. In addition, only a handful of candidates have a record of publicly casting doubt on the electoral process, and some of them have sidestepped the issue this cycle. That stands in sharp contrast to 2022, when GOP nominees for key statewide races in Nevada had a record of echoing election conspiracies — in particular, contenders in the U.S. Senate, attorney general and secretary of state contests — and candidates in aboutone-third of state legislative primarieseither cast doubt on the electoral process or supported the “Big Lie,” a series of false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former President Donald Trump through widespread voter fraud. Many backers of the “Big Lie” suffered at the 2022 ballot box. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Laxalt, a former attorney general and the face of the Trump campaign’s effort to overturn Nevada’s 2020 election results, attempted to walk a“rigged election” tightropein his 2022 race, while secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant drewnationalheadlinesfor his conspiratorial claims about rigged elections. Both Laxalt and Marchant lost their races. Nevada adoptedseveral election rule changesin 2020 because of the pandemic, including sending mail ballots to all registered voters and allowing so-called ballot harvesting, where people can drop off completed ballots of non-family members. In 2021, the Legislature permanentlyexpandeduniversal mail-in voting while allowing voters to opt out of receiving mail ballots. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office has referred 14 cases of potential election fraud for criminal prosecution since 2020 out of hundreds of reports received and more than 2.4 million votes cast, according toan April report. A nationwide Morning Consultpoll in Decemberfound that 69 percent of respondents are confident that their vote would be accurately counted in 2024, with 60 percent of Republicans and 85 percent of Democrats responding that they were “very confident” or “somewhat confident.” Whether these moves by Republican candidates in 2024 reflect a change in attitude or a change in campaign strategy, one takeaway is clear — false claims of election fraud are not coming up as often this election cycle. Joanna Lydgate, the CEO of States United Action, a nonprofit that tracks election denialism in state and federal races, said in an interview that the shift is part of a new approach following GOP losses in 2022, in which candidates may lean away from denying the results of the 2020 election in favor of supporting measures under the framing of “election integrity."" “We saw that there was actually an electoral price, a political price that was paid for the election denier platform,” Lydgate said. “And so people, I think, have pivoted, especially in states like Nevada.” Methodology: The candidates included in this analysis are Republicans running for Congress or the Legislature whom The Nevada Independent has identified as having a realistic chance of winning their primary or general elections. We removed candidates running in districts with a significant Democratic advantage, as well as candidates who raised less than $1,000 in the first quarter of 2024. See below or a closer look at each candidate included in the analysis. If we missed anything, you can email[email protected]. Legislature None of the nine Republican legislative candidates endorsed by Gov. Joe Lombardo and seeking office for the first time has a public record of making election-related conspiracy theories, and none of their campaign websites mention election security,The Indyfound. These candidatestend to have a significant financial advantagein their races, giving them a leg up over potential GOP primary challengers. They are running in critical swing races that could determine whether the governor holds onto his veto power. In Lombardo’s 2022 gubernatorial bid, he pledged to support legislation requiring voter ID and ending universal mail voting and ballot harvesting. But his proposals did not pass in the Democrat-controlled Legislature, and last year, hejoinedother top Nevada Republicans in encouraging people to vote early or by mail. Amy Tarkanian, a former state GOP chair, said in an interview that Lombardo is having to toe the line between “people who are reasonable” and “conspiracy theorists,” particularly those running the state Republican Party. “Seeing him endorse these more levelheaded candidates is promising,” Tarkanian said. “Instead of spreading misinformation, disinformation and lies and throwing temper tantrums, you need to get people elected in order to make changes to the laws.” Ryan Erwin, Lombardo’s top political strategist, did not respond to a request for comment. The only non-incumbent endorsed by Lombardo with a public history of spreading election conspiracies is Elko-based former Assemblyman John Ellison, who is running for the open, deep-red Senate District 19 seat. Ellisonsaid in 2021that the Jan. 6 insurrection was led by the left-wing group Antifa and said the election was stolen from Trump. He did not respond to a request for comment. Lombardo has endorsed three legislators who have in the past endorsed or echoed claims of potential election irregularities: Sen. Carrie Buck (R-Henderson), Assemblywoman Jill Dickman (R-Sparks) and Assemblyman Ken Gray (R-Dayton). In a March interview,Gray walked backcomments made at a 2022 campaign rally andon Facebookthat the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, tellingThe Indythat he is unsure whether there was widespread fraud but that he still had questions about the election results. Buck suggested in a 2021 committee hearing that 1,500 dead people voted in 2020, and Dickman complained of “potential election fraud” in aDecember 2020 Facebook post. Neither responded to requests for comment. Gray, Dickman and Assemblyman Gregory Koenig (R-Fallon) are the only Lombardo-endorsed legislative candidates to mention election integrity as an issue on their campaign websites. Meanwhile, several non-Lombardo-endorsed Republican legislative candidates who raised at least $1,000 in the first quarter of 2024 — a sign of whether a candidate has a legitimate campaign apparatus— are not shying away from campaigning on election integrity. Jon Petrick, a GOP candidate in Southern Nevada’s Assembly District 21,tweeted in 2022that there were “clearly irregularities in the last election.” In an election integritycampaign video, he said he supported eliminating universal mail-in ballots without the voter’s request, ending ballot harvesting and discontinuing the use of voting machines built outside the U.S. Petrick, a chiropractor who was the GOP nominee in the district last cycle, was the only Republican challenger to raise more money than his Lombardo-endorsed opponent in the first quarter, raking in more than $20,000. Petrick toldThe Nevada Independentthat his election policy positions are meant to improve trust in the American electoral system, which he said has eroded because of “discrepancies” in the 2020 election. He referred to2,000 Mules, awidely discredited moviethat claims there was widespread voter fraud in 2020, as a reason people are concerned about elections, in addition to an influx of undocumented immigrants (who are legally barred from voting) and election administration changes during the COVID-19 “plandemic.” He said more candidates should focus on the issue of election integrity. “It's not something I'm gonna run away [from],” he said. April Arndt, a Lombardo-endorsed candidate running against Petrick who does not list election policies on her website, toldThe Indythat she supports the governor's policies related to election integrity and that she's helping circulate a petition for a potentialballot questionrelated to voter ID . Josh Leavitt, a Republican running for Senate District 18 in the northwestern part of the Las Vegas Valley, supports mandatory voter ID, according to hiscampaign website, which calls voter fraud a “serious problem that can undermine the legitimacy and credibility of elections.” In an interview, Leavitt said he has heard from voters who are concerned about people impersonating others at the polls, which he said voter ID would fix, but acknowledged there was a lack of proof that this was widespread. “If people can go in there and just call themselves a name, be directed on how to vote and beef up certain numbers in certain districts to give some political insiders an unfair advantage, it's a big issue,” Leavitt said. “Do I have evidence? No, but these are the stories that we hear.” Leavitt, who said he did not vote in the 2020 presidential election, did not answer whether he believed the results were fraudulent, adding that his focus is on issues that can be addressed locally. Leavitt has two primary challengers. Clark County Fire Chief John Steinbeck (who’s endorsed by Lombardo) does not include the topic on his website, and Assemblyman Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas) does not have a public record of echoing election conspiracies. Ken Miller, a political science professor at UNLV, said the issue’s dominance in 2022 was because it allowed Republicans to cement themselves as aligned with Trump, who is behind many of the conspiracies surrounding his 2020 loss. “It’s just a talking point,” Miller said. “It’s quickly and easily discarded when they move onto the next election.” Trump in his current bid continues to claim the 2020 election was rigged against him, and the Republican National Committee (RNC)said last monththat there was “massive fraud” in 2020. The RNC, which is run by more staunchly pro-Trump leaders after recent turnover, has launchedelection-related lawsuitsin half of the swing states,including Nevada, targeting state voter rolls and mail ballot rules. The Trump campaign — along with the RNC and Nevada GOP —filed another lawsuitlast week arguing that Nevada is violating federal law by allowing any mail ballot postmarked by Election Day to count as long as it is received within four days after Election Day. Congress The Nevada congressional candidates with a history of making false election fraud claims are mostly concentrated in the U.S. Senate primary, though the top candidate has toned down his messaging on the topic. Sam Brown, the front-runner backed by national Republicans,has essentially the same election integrity policyas he did in his Senate runtwo years ago, which includes a pledge to pass election integrity legislation and to support voter identification measures. Brown at one point attacked his 2022 opponent, Laxalt, for not doing enough in the aftermath of the 2020 election to hand the Silver State to Trump. Buthe toldThe Nevada Independentlast year that he was “pretty confident” in the nation’s elections and that he didn’t want to “relitigate” the 2020 election. Brown’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his election integrity policies. Jeff Gunter, who was Trump’s U.S. ambassador to Iceland and has emerged as the biggest  threat to Brown, has focused his campaign on being “110 percent” pro-Trump. Hiscampaign websitecalls for ending ballot harvesting and strengthening voter identification, and says that universal mail ballots are “wasteful, expensive, and messy.” His campaign did not answer over email whether he believed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. He declined to answer the same question from theLas Vegas Review-Journallast year, adding that he believed there were many irregularities in the race but that he thinks voters are focused on the future. The two prominent GOP Senate candidates leaning into election conspiracies trail significantly in money raised. Marchant, the 2022 Nevada secretary of state nominee and former assemblyman, is one of the nation’smost prominent election deniers, suggesting ina 2022 debatethat Nevadans’ votes have not counted for years, andallegingthat a global “cabal” has been manipulating voting machines for years. In hiscandidacy announcementlast year, Marchant made no mention of election fraud, but in a Senate candidate forum in February he took credit for creating “an election integrity movement throughout the country.”His campaign has been much less active this year and only raised $49,000 from January through March. Stephanie Phillips, a Las Vegas real estate agent, suggested at the February candidate forum that the winner of the Senate race will need at least 600,000 votes to stave off Democratic cheating. Her X account also includes aslewofunfoundedclaims of election fraud. She has raised around $64,000. In the state’s four U.S. House districts, no Republican candidates’ websites included references to election integrity, but some have previously cast doubt on the security of the electoral system. Former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien, who is running for Congressional District 3, posted avideoearlier this year falsely suggesting thata glitch in Nevada’s voter history databaseafter the February presidential primary was evidence of voter fraud and arguing that “they’re at it again in Nevada.” The next day, she postedanother videothat restoring faith in elections is one of her two top priorities, arguing for strict limits on mail and absentee voting. John Lee, a candidate for Nevada’s 4th Congressional District, former Democratic state senator and former mayor of North Las Vegas whoswitched parties in 2021before a Republican run for governor in 2022, has posted election conspiracies onFacebookmultipletimes, including onepostthat said what was happening in the American electoral system was a “complete crime.” Lee, who was endorsed by Lombardo, said in an interview that he is not focusing on election integrity as much this go-around because while he has heard allegations of irregularities, he has not seen anything himself. He added that his prior posts resulted from him being concerned about ballot harvesting, but that he does not have a problem with how Clark County runs its elections. “The biggest problem we have is not the voter integrity, it's more people actually getting out and voting,” Lee said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/the-four-most-interesting-democratic-state-senate-primaries-in-nevada,True,"A Culinary-backed candidate taking on a longtime legislator supported by other unions. A higher education regent squaring off against a veteran North Las Vegas legislator under FBI investigation. A first-term assemblywoman facing a Reno councilwoman. And a formerBachelorettecontestant confronting an establishment-backed Democrat who lobbied for the Oakland Athletics last year. These are four Senate Democratic primaries thatThe Nevada Independentis monitoring closely because of their potential to divide Democratic constituencies. In two of these races, the winner of the June 11 primary will most likely prevail in the general election because the districts are solidly Democratic. In the two other races, Democrats see a possible pickup opportunity in the general election as they seek the one additional Senate seat needed for a supermajority, or two-thirds of seats in both chambers, allowing them to override any potential vetoes issued by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. Here’s a closer look at the dynamics in the four races.Click on the headings below to jump to a specific race. Senate District 3 - Rochelle Nguyen vs. Geoconda Hughes Senate District 4 - Dina Neal vs. Laura Perkins Senate District 5 - Christian Bishop vs. Jennifer Atlas Senate District 15 - Angie Taylor vs. Naomi Duerr SAFE DEMOCRATIC SEATS Senate District 3 The Democratic primary for Senate District 3 in Las Vegas is a battle of the unions. Culinary Workers Union Local 226 is running Geoconda Hughes, a nurse practitioner for the Dignity Health Medical Group and daughter of the union’s former secretary-treasurer, to challenge incumbent Sen. Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas). But other Nevada unions are split. Nguyen has racked up endorsements from the Clark County Education Association (CCEA) and the Las Vegas branches of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Laborers Union (which represents construction workers) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Hughes, meanwhile, has the backing of the Nevada State Education Association (NSEA) and the Southern Nevada branches of Teamsters and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW). Nguyen, an attorney and former assemblywoman, is running her first race as a senator after she was appointed to the open Senate District 3 seat in 2022. She joined the Assembly in 2019 and quickly rose up the ranks. John Vellardita, the executive director of CCEA, said Culinary’s decision to enter a candidate is because he believes it is “a political force that’s in decline.” “The Culinary didn't get what it wanted in this last legislative session, so they're going after the majority leader's leadership team,” he said. Ted Pappageorge, Culinary’s secretary-treasurer, said in an interview that “we don’t worry about” outside perception of political influence and that their support for Hughes is based on not wanting more “attorneys and developers” in the Legislature. “Somebody [who] has to punch a time clock is going to do a much better job for Nevadans,” Pappageorge said. So far, both campaigns are focused on Culinary. Hughes’ challenge to Nguyen centers around her support ofSB441, a bill that received bipartisan support (and Culinary’s opposition) to remove the pandemic-imposed requirement to clean all hotel rooms daily. In an interview, Hughes said the legislation (which was eventually rendered moot in Las Vegas hotels with union contracts because new contracts reinstated the requirement) hurt “some of the hardest working people of our state.” “She showed very clearly who she sided with — that was big industry,” Hughes said. The gaming industry is expected to contribute heavily to Nguyen. Her supporters also comprise of an alliance of groups that often don’t agree, including the gaming industry and the trial lawyers, both of which contributed to Nguyen during the first quarter. Nguyen is taking aim at the Culinary — albeit not directly. Last week, she released her firstcampaign ad, which centers around her support to lower prescription drug prices, an apparent reference to AB250, a bill passed along party lines but vetoed by Lombardo. The legislation would have seen Nevada piggyback off the federal Inflation Reduction Act — which allowed Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs beginning in 2026 — byapplying those price caps statewide, not just to those on Medicare. In a bill hearing, officials with Culinary, which has its own pharmacy and health plan for members, testified that they opposed the legislation. Union representatives wanted the issue to instead be introduced in the 2025 session (closer to when the federal drug pricing negotiations begin) and for a more collaborative bill process. “Being supportive of bills, like AB250, I think is super important,” Nguyen said. “I think that's what distinguishes me from my opponent.” A Culinary spokesperson toldThe Indylast week that the union did not actually oppose the legislation but had to register as an opponent to suggest fixes to the legislation. The winner of the June primary is all but guaranteed to win in November because the district — which stretches from central to northwestern Las Vegas — is solidly Democratic. Senate District 4 As Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) seeks to hold onto her Senate seat, she’s facing a couple of challenges. First, she’s underFBI investigationbased on allegations that she asked for small business grant money to be steered to a business owned by her friend. Second, she’s up against a higher education regent who’s being backed by top North Las Vegas officials with whom she has feuded. Neal was an assemblywoman from 2010 to 2020 and has since represented Senate District 4, the same seat that her father, the late Sen. Joe Neal, held for nearly 30 years. She declined an interview but responded toThe Indy’s questions in writing (she did not answer a question about voter perception of the FBI investigation). Asked about the differences between her and her opponent, Neal said “[v]oters are smart and they don’t need politicians telling them what to think.” “I am going to win this race the same way I’ve won every race I have ever run, by meeting voters where they are at,” the response said. Neal said she wants to do more to hold the Clark County School District accountable, increase health care accessibility and affordability and make sure that the North Las Vegas community is not ignored. In the 2023 legislative session, Neal sponsoredSB450, a bill to convert the dilapidatedWindsor Park neighborhoodin North Las Vegas — which was built over geographic faults and was redlined for decades — into a park and relocate the 93 remaining residents. The legislation tapped into $25 million of coronavirus relief funds and allocated $12 million to the state’s housing division to develop the land and relocate residents. Nevada System of Higher Education Regent Laura Perkins has been in office since 2018 following a nine-year stint as a North Las Vegas planning commissioner. But in her campaign, Perkins is not focused on Neal, but on her time as a regent, saying it has given her a “wider point of view” of how state budgets and policy work. Asked about how she would pitch herself to undecided voters, Perkins said she would emphasize her approachability and “open door policy.” Perkins will have to overcome a lackluster fundraising haul from the start of this year. She raised just $2,000 in the first quarter — she only entered the race at the end of the quarter and was previously running for re-election as a regent — and trails Neal by more than $20,000 in cash on hand. However, she has the support of North Las Vegas Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown. A spokesperson said Goynes-Brown was unavailable for an interview last week. The endorsements followed tension between city officials and Neal last year. Sheaccused officialsof committing perjury during a committee hearing on since-abandoned plans to buy land that housed the since-demolished Texas Station casino. Neal cited mixed messaging surrounding whether the city intended to purchase the property. She alsosparredwith city officials over a bill regarding a city charter committee. Isaac Barron, a North Las Vegas councilman who endorsed Perkins, said he has known her for more than a decade and that Neal has done things that are “n​​ot in line with the direction that that our city is going,” but he did not name specifics. “It’s time for someone new to represent us,” Barron said. SWING SEATS Senate District 5 In Senate District 5, which covers parts of Henderson and Paradise, two Democrats are running to challenge Sen. Carrie Buck (R-Henderson). Establishment-backed former lobbyist Jennifer Atlas has raised almost double that of challenger Christian Bishop in the first quarter. But Bishop is outspending Atlas. The swing district has a fairly even split of registered Democratic (about 29 percent) and Republican voters (almost 30 percent), with the highest percentage of voters registered as nonpartisans (nearly 34 percent). It’s one of the few districts Democrats hope to flip blue this election cycle. Atlas received endorsements from the Senate Democratic Caucus, progressive groups such as Emily’s List, Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada and several unions, including the State Federation of labor representing more than 150,000 members, the Nevada AFL-CIO and the Carpenters Local 1977. Bishop received an endorsement from the Nevada State Education Association, a statewide teacher’s union which has heavily criticized the Legislature’s approval of a $380 million public financing deal to bring the Oakland Athletics to Las Vegas. Representatives from the union did not answer a query about why it endorsed Bishop instead of Atlas, who was notablyone of 19 lobbyistsrepresenting the team during the 2023 legislative session.Atlas came to Southern Nevada almost 18 years ago as a competitive ballroom dancer and then worked in hospitality before eventually training as a paralegal and transitioning into lobbying. She no longer works as a lobbyist and is a paralegal for the Coburn and Martin law firm. Atlas said she sees her lobbying experience as a benefit. “It means I can go to work on day one. I understand the process,” she said. A single mom, Atlas said she is running for the seat because of her 9-year-old son and a desire to improve schools, such as reducing the number of long-term substitute teachers and large class sizes. “I look into his eyes, and I want Nevada to make sense for him and his friends. When they go out into the world, I want them to have every chance at success,” she said. Atlas wants to propose legislation that would automatically enroll babies who qualify for Medicaid in the government-funded health insurance program. She said her son spent 30 days in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit after his birth, and she had to navigate a half-million-dollar medical bill because of confusion about whether he qualified. Bishop, who works in the tech space and was a former contestant onThe BacheloretteandBachelor in Paradise, said he’s running because Buck has been unable to pass any bills she sponsored during the2021and2023legislative sessions when Democrats controlled both chambers (as the majority party, Democrats can unilaterally kill bills). “You’ve got to be able to work across the aisle and get things done for Nevadans,” Bishop said. He added that he grew up with a single mom, and the educational opportunities he received helped him achieve success — something he wants to help other families access. If elected, he said he’d like to focus on accountability in education and bring in industries that can offer internships and trade skills training for students. Bishop called the Senate Democratic Caucus’ endorsement process “a real interesting one.” As for the distinguishing factors between him and Atlas, Bishop demurred. “If groups are going to support a candidate, go for it, that's their right to do,” Bishop said. “I'm just really sensitive to always make sure it doesn't undermine our democracy, and that everybody has a fair chance to run, and that there's no gatekeeping.” Atlas said she wouldn’t have run if the Senate Democratic Caucus thought there was a better candidate, and has been relentlessly reaching out to voters, highlighting her pro-abortion rights stance. Bishop said he is taking a “day by day” approach to winning the primary, which began with an early fundraising start. Bishop has a slightly higher cash-on-hand advantage over Atlas heading into the second quarter, but a third of it consists of a $25,000 contribution he gave himself inDecember. Senate District 15 In September, within days of one another, Reno City Councilwoman Naomi Duerr and Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno) announced plans to run for Senate District 15, setting up a Democratic primary challenge in a key legislative seat. The two Democrats, both with deep experience in local government, are competing to run in the general election for the seat occupied by Sen. Heidi Seevers Gansert (R-Reno), whoannounced in Augustthat she would not run for re-election. Republican Senate Caucus-endorsed Mike Ginsburg, a longtime member of the Builders Association of Northern Nevada, is considered the front-runner in a three-way GOP primary. Not much information is available on the third Democratic candidate in the race, Johnny Kerns, who is primarily supported by a self-donation of $1,000. The Reno-area district was a top target of Democrats during the 2021 redistricting process — thenew mapsturned a district that was nearly evenly split between Democrats and Republicans to one with a comfortable Democratic advantage. The district now has more than 33 percent of voters registered as Democrats, about 28 percent registered as Republicans and nearly 31 percent registered as nonpartisan. Taylor, who was elected as an assemblywoman in 2022 and previously served eight years on the Washoe County School Board, is the CEO of Guardian Quest, which provides organizations with equity, diversity and unconscious bias training. “I don't have anybody [I won’t meet with], unless you give me a reason. I want to hear what you have to say,” Taylor said. “The same principles I teach are the same principles I use down in the Legislature.” She said she wants to move from the Assembly to the Senate because the longer Senate terms offer a greater ability to serve constituents and develop more substantive legislation. Duerr is halfway through her third and final term on the city council. She owns a small business working with the mining industry. Duerr said she is running because she wants to focus on addressing statewide problems she hasn’t been able to tackle at the local level. Duerr highlighted her experience as a geologist and time on the city council, saying the combination makes her effective in understanding scientific and human issues and addressing public policy problems. If elected, Duerr wants to focus on affordable housing, the environment, water management and addressing a shortage of veterinarians. As someone who experienced fertility issues, she said that protecting access to reproductive services is of the utmost importance. Though Duerr was not endorsed by the caucus, she said she’s made every effort to support constituents in the past. “Those are the people I care about the most. Endorsements are nice, money is nice, absolutely,” Duerr said. “But at the end of the day, you have to have a connection and understanding with the people that you're representing and that is where I think I shine.” Taylor said what sets her apart is her existing relationships with people working in the capitol, a doctorate in education and the backing of the Senate Democratic Caucus. She also cited success in passing legislation with bipartisan support. During the 2023 legislative session, she worked with Lombardo on two complementary bills thattightened school discipline laws; both advanced as part of a deal topass two major budget bills. She said she wants to ensure that teachers are supported and that the historic funding allocated during the 2023 legislative session equates to greater learning for students — efforts she said her education background makes her “uniquely qualified” to help address. Taylor said she’s also prioritizing health care affordability and access. She had breast cancer at the same time as a friend who had less insurance coverage than she did, and Taylor noticed disparities in her friend’s care. Though Taylor has, so far, outraised Duerr, both candidates said they’re not underestimating the other. “I would not have the people count me out,” Duerr said. “I am running a race to win it because I think it matters to our community that I'm there in the Legislature advocating for them.” Taylor said that there are two ways to run for office: unopposed or scared. “My whole approach has been get out there and work hard. Talk to people, let them know why I'm running and why I think I'm the best candidate for this job,” she said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-campaign-sues-nevada-for-accepting-mail-ballots-that-trickle-in-after-election-day,True,"The Trump campaign and its allies filed a lawsuit Friday challenging a Nevada law allowing elections officials to accept mail ballots for up to four business days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked before polls close. The lawsuit alleges that the four-day period for mail ballots to be received violates federal law because it does not conform to the Election Day deadline established by the federal government. Attorneys for the plaintiffs, which include the Republican National Committee and the Nevada Republican Party, argue that the law establishing the ballot timeline is therefore “unlawful and must be enjoined.” “The result of Nevada’s violation of federal law is that timely, valid ballots are diluted by untimely, invalid ballots, which violates the rights of candidates, campaigns, and voters under federal law,” attorneys wrote in the lawsuit filed in federal district court in Nevada. Nevada adopted a largely all-mail voting system in 2021, permanently codifying pandemic-related election changes adopted for the 2020 election season. The legislation was staunchly opposed by Republicans and passed on party lines out of both the Assembly and Senate. The legislation reduced some of the deadlines that were implemented during the 2020 election — shortening from seven to four days the timeframe after an election when mail ballots postmarked by Election Day can be accepted. There is a reduction of seven to six days in time for voters to fix issues on their mail ballot (a process called “signature cure”). Nevada is one ofeight statesthat allow elections to be conducted entirely by mail. These include California, which allows mail ballots to be receivedno later than three days after Election Day, Oregon, which counts ballots receivedup to seven days after Election Day, and Utah, which only requires that ballots be postmarked bythe day before Election Day. Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said in a statement that the secretary of state’s office will not comment on ongoing litigation, “but I hope the RNC is putting as much time and energy into educating voters on how to participate in elections as they put into suing the state of Nevada.” Aguilar added that Nevada runs some of the most secure, transparent and accessible elections in the country. The key to that accessibility, he said, is allowing Nevadans to choose what voting method works best for them, including mail. In a conversation about the future of Nevada’s elections withThe Nevada IndependentCEO Jon Ralston at a Thursday event hosted by UNR andThe Atlantic, Aguilar said the adoption of mail ballots has increased since it was first implemented in 2020 and the state needs to increase the capacity of counties to process mail ballots. With the deadline for accepting mail-in ballots falling four days after Election Day, complete results are not as immediately available as in the past. Nevada’s status as a purple state can often mean narrow vote margins where every ballot could make the difference between a win or a loss for candidates, so media outlets and other observers sometimes wait days to declare a winner in certain races. The more time it takes to issue results, Aguilar said, the more opportunity there is for false narratives, even though there is no evidence of widespread fraud in Nevada’s election system. “We’re a purple state, we’re a battleground state, we have extremely competitive elections and the accuracy of those elections is critical,” Aguilar said, adding that there’s a rigorous signature curing and review process for each ballot.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lombardo-endorses-marty-odonnell-in-nevadas-3rd-district-republican-primary,True,"Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) has put his thumb on the scale in Congressional District 3 once again, endorsing video game music composer Marty O’Donnell in the Republican primary to take on Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV). O’Donnell is a political newcomer who has never previously run for office. He launched hisfirst adof the cycle Wednesday, focusing on border security and casting immigration as harmful to “American workers.” Congressional District 3 is routinely the closest House race in Nevada and a target for in-state and national Republicans alike. O’Donnell comes with the benefit of being a self-funder and isworking with consultantswho ran the governor’s successful 2022 campaign. This is not Lombardo’s first endorsement in either this race or across federal elections — a sign of hisincreasing effortsto build out his own political apparatus, separate from the state party, to rival Democrats’ historically well-organized machine. He previously endorsed Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas) for the House seat, but she ended updropping outof the race after consulting with the governor and is running again for her competitive Assembly seat. Her victory there could help protect Lombardo’s veto power, with a Democratic statehouse supermajority a possibility in 2024. O’Donnell faces a crowded primary of other self-funded candidates, including former state Treasurer Dan Schwartz. Schwartz has alreadyloanedhis campaign $800,000 to O’Donnell’s $500,000, giving the former treasurer more cash on hand at the end of the first quarter. Other candidates include tax analyst Drew Johnson and former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien. Despite the attention and resources from Republicans, Lee haswon three straight elections, including a victory by 4 percentage points in 2022. Her fundraising dwarfs her potential competitors; she has a war chest of over $2.1 million.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/after-losing-three-straight-times-are-republicans-as-invested-in-vegas-house-seats,True,"After Democrats held on to all three Las Vegas-based House seats for two consecutive election cycles, national Republicans again took aim at flipping the seats in 2022, with one key GOP PACpouring more moneyinto the districts of Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) and Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) than any other in the country. But while Republicans ultimately did win the House, with a net gain of nine seats, the path to the gavel did not run through Las Vegas. Lee won re-election by 4 percentage points; Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) by nearly 5, and Titus by more than 5, despite even our boss / Nevada’s Nostradamus Jon Ralston predicting Lee would lose her seat. After so many unsuccessful pulls at the electoral slot machine, have national House Republicans moved on from Las Vegas? Not quite. The three Las Vegas seats are still on thelistof 37 pickup opportunities identified by the National Republican Congressional Committee, and two Republican operatives who work on Nevada races, granted anonymity to speak freely, are optimistic about the prospect of severalself-funded candidateswho could emerge as challengers. But with both parties increasingly homing in on seats in New York and California, Republicans with knowledge of the races also said they expect less national GOP investment in the Nevada House races compared with last cycle. Congressional Leadership Fund, the Kevin McCarthy-backed (R-CA) super PAC thatpumpedmore than $6 million into Lee’s race last cycle, has yet to announce its initial spending, despite havingdone soby this point last year. That may not necessarily translate to lower spending totals — given the costly and crowded Las Vegas media market and the fact that fundraising only increases every cycle. But between competing for ad space and air time with the presidential race and the U.S. Senate race — not to mention the frustrating results from last cycle in a midterm historically linked to big losses by the incumbent president’s party — Lee, Titus and Horsford are likely not going to be as significant of a target for Republican leadership as last cycle. What’s different The 2022 cycle was the first assessment for both parties of Nevada Democrats’ redistricting plan adopted in 2021, operating under the strategy that three districts with narrow-ish Democratic majorities was a more favorable map than maintaining the traditionally deep blue Congressional District 1 and two extremely competitive districts. By shifting some suburban areas with more independent and Republican voters into Titus’ safely Democratic district, Democrats gambled that they could shore up Lee’s and Horsford’s margins while still protecting Titus. The maps paid off — and now Republicans must consider if they want to keep putting money into testing them. While intense spending and campaigning is already underway in swing districts around the country, the Nevada House primary races have been “kind of sleepy right now,” in the words of one Republican strategist. Only one candidate, Congressional District 4’s David Flippo, has reserved television ad time with less than a month to go before mail ballots are sent out around the state. Still, that doesn’t mean they’re giving up on the seats. In Lee’s race in particular, Republicans are excited about GOP candidate Marty O’Donnell, a video game music composer who isworking with the consultantswho engineered Gov. Joe Lombardo’s (R) successful gubernatorial bid. O’Donnell is in a crowded primary with former Treasurer Dan Schwartz, a fellow self-funder, tax analyst Drew Johnson and former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien. All but Helgelien haveloanedtheir campaigns hundreds of thousands of dollars, with Schwartz leading the pack at $800,000 (though Lee’s cash on hand remains significantly greater than any potential opponent). In Congressional District 1, repeat 2022 candidate Mark Robertson and self-funded restaurateur Flemming Larsen are squaring off to take on Titus, while in Congressional District 4, Horsford will likely face either Air Force veteran Flippo or former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, who has the distinction of having won elected office before and boasts an endorsement from Lombardo. In Congressional District 1, Larsen actually has a larger war chest than Titus, though most of his $1.5 million is loaned. Powered by a $500,000 loan from himself, John Lee technically outraised Horsford in the first quarter of 2024, but Horsford retains a significant cash on hand advantage and the benefit of having contributions rather than loan money that can be pulled back at the discretion of the candidate. Given that the presidential election will lead to higher turnout, Republicans are hopeful that voters who sat the 2022 midterms out might finally turn out and help oust Lee, who has won three straight terms in a seat that has been competitive since its creation in 2002, although its boundaries have changed slightly over the years. “Biden is more unpopular now than he was in 2022,” a Republican strategist familiar with the race said, adding that the conventional wisdom of high turnout boosting Democrats might no longer be true. “We haven't completely grappled with the idea that higher turnout helps Republicans.” On the Democratic side, meanwhile, operatives believe a superior ground game and well-established incumbent candidates will keep the three districts in their win column. Political analysts who run major ratings so far seem to agree. The Cook Political Report rates Lee’s race as “Lean Democrat,” when she used to occupy the “Toss Up” category; Horsford and Titus are considered “Likely Democrat.” House Majority PAC, the high-spending outside group connected to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), made the first move of the cycle byreservingover $6.8 million in ad spending for the fall in Las Vegas, including earmarking more than $750,000 for Spanish-language content. The ad buy signifies both the costly nature of the Las Vegas market, the fact that there are three seats in the area and its continued importance to Democratic ambitions — the group is only spending more in Los Angeles, New York City, Portland and Detroit. Democratic strategists are confident they’ll retain the Las Vegas seats — and believe the incumbents are particularly effective and well-disciplined in their messaging, compared with members in other states. One Democratic strategist said that none of the potential Republican candidates concern them, and that once outside Republican spending does come in, they expect the GOP’s focus to be in other states. “They're probably not going to spend as much [in Nevada] as they are doing elsewhere,” the strategist said. “That's going to be really indicative of them kind of conceding that they're not going to win these seats.” Editor’s note: This story appears in Indy Elections, The Nevada Independent’s newsletter dedicated to comprehensive coverage of the 2024 elections.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/complaint-alleges-far-right-reno-activist-broke-campaign-finance-rules,True,"Former Reno City Councilman Paul McKenzie, aDemocrat, has filed an election complaint to the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office alleging that far-right activist Robert Beadles failed to report recent political expenses through his PAC. The complaint alleges that Beadles’ Operation Sunlight PAC paid for severalFacebook adsdating back prior to 2022,when Operation Sunlight last filed an expense report. McKenzie said that conduct violates rules listed onthe secretary of state’s websiterequiring PACs to file quarterly expense and contribution reports. “The PAC has attacked candidates up and down the ballot and promoted extreme ideas … in attempts to turn Washoe County into a county that’s molded in Beadles’ view of what he thinks politics should be,” McKenzie said during a Thursday morning press meeting. Beadles did not respond to a request for comment. The secretary of state’s office also didn’t immediately respond for request for comment. According to McKenzie, the ads in question came from a Facebook page called “Operation Sunlight” — which is the name of Beadles’ blog — and some of the ads were flagged and removed because the political content goes against Facebook’s ad policy. Several of the advertised posts claimed widespread voting fraud occurred in the 2022 elections — something state election officials say is false. Though many of the ads estimate the expense at less than $100, other ads — such as one disparaging Washoe County Commissioners Alexis Hill and Clara Andriola — claim the expenses in the $500 to $599 range, according to Facebook-required ad disclosures. In total, Operation Sunlight has spent more than$161,000on Facebook ads since 2018. Beadles’ other PAC, The Franklin Project, has filed regular expense and contribution reports from 2022 to themost recent deadline in April 2024. Beadles is a prominent Republican donor and election conspiracy theorist, who is an at-large member of the Washoe GOP executive committee. Since January 2021, Beadles and his wife, Nicole, have donatedmore than $200,000to Northern Nevada candidates and the county Republican party, while also filing multiple failed lawsuits seeking widespread changes to voting systems amid fantastical claims of widespread voting fraud. McKenzie said he hopes the complaint he filed will prompt the secretary of state to investigate these ads, then refer the complaint to the attorney general for legal action. ""They call themselves Operation Sunlight, but they want to operate in darkness,"" McKenzie said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/candidates-backed-by-lombardo-or-democratic-caucuses-locked-in-close-fundraising-battle,True,"The legislative fundraising battle is tight between GOP candidates backed by Gov. Joe Lombardo and their likely general election opponents supported by the Democratic establishment. The Nevada Independentidentified 10 legislative elections that are expected to be competitive in the general election — based on voter registration data and past results — and have establishment-backed candidates in both parties. In these races, there is an even split of contests in which the Lombardo-backed candidates raised more money from January through March and races where the Democratic candidate had a fundraising lead. Some of these candidates still have to prevail in their June primary race, but establishment-backed candidateshave an early fundraising lead, giving them a leg up in their races. The stakes are high — Democrats control 13 seats in the 21-member state Senate (one short of a two-thirds supermajority needed to override a veto) and 28 seats — a supermajority — in the 42-member Assembly. The outcome of a few key races could change whether Lombardo’s ability to veto bills stands. Read below for highlights of noteworthy races based on campaign finance reports due last week, which offer the last comprehensive glimpse of the fundraising picture before the June primary: Incumbent behind in fundraising In Senate District 11, which includes portions of southwestern Las Vegas, Republican Lori Rogichraised$96,300 more than incumbent Sen. Dallas Harris (D-Las Vegas), who is seeking her second full term after she was first appointed to the seat in 2018 and whoraisedabout $63,000 during the first quarter. Rogich’s notable donations, which contributed to a haul of more than $159,300, include a maximum $10,000 donation from Miriam Adelson, a prominent Republican donor who owns theLas Vegas Review-Journaland has anestimated net worth of $32 billion. A pro-Lombardo political action committee, Nevada Way PAC, also donated $5,000 to Rogich’s campaign alongside $5,000 from Sen. Robin Titus (R-Wellington). Harris’s haul was supported by a $10,000 donation from Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager’s (D-Las Vegas) Nevada Strong PAC, a $10,000 contribution from Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-North Las Vegas), $5,000 from Sen. Roberta Lange (D-Las Vegas) and $5,000 from the pro-Democrat New Day Nevada PAC. Heading into the primary, Rogich, an attorney who served as co-chair of Lombardo’s education transition committee and is married to prominent consultant Sig Rogich, has about $279,600 in cash on hand, while Harris has more than $183,700. So far, Rogich has outspent Harris, reporting about $43,800 in campaign expenses to the $16,100 Harris has spent. Harris is not facing a primary challenger, though Rogich will face Brian Martin Paonessa (whoraised less than $2,000in the quarter) in the district’s Republican primary. Republicans view this Democratic-leaning district as an opportunity to flip a state Senate seat. However, name recognition matters inlegislative elections. Narrowest fundraising difference The closest fundraising difference between Lombardo-backed and Democratic Caucus-backed candidates came in the open Assembly District 35, a district that covers parts of southwest Las Vegas and isbeing vacatedby Assemblywoman Michelle Gorelow (D-Las Vegas). In the fundraising battle, Democratic business owner Sharifa Wahabraised more than $26,700during the first quarter, while Republican Dr. Rebecca Edgeworthraised more than $27,800. Edgeworth received $5,000 from the pro-Lombardo Nevada Way PAC, $2,500 from the Clark County Firefighters PAC and $1,500 from NEV MED Political Action. She also received $1,000 donations from Republican Assemblymembers Melissa Hardy, Brian Hibbetts, Heidi Kasama, Greg Hafen and Bert Gurr. Wahab received $10,000 from Lange, $2,000 from Yeager, $1,000 from Assemblyman Duy Nguyen (D-Las Vegas), $1,000 from Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) and $1,000 from Assemblywoman Erica Mosca (D-Las Vegas). Edgeworth has $51,000 in cash on hand, and Wahab has about $20,800. Edgeworth reported spending more than $7,500 while Wahab reported about $515 in expenses. Neither candidate is facing a primary. Recovery advocate posts six-figure haul The race for Assembly District 4 — open because Assemblyman Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas) is running for Senate District 18 — offers a pickup opportunity for Democrats. Democrats have hitched their wagons to Ryan Hampton, a political newcomer who served as an aide to former President Bill Clinton and has led many addiction recovery campaigns (Hampton is in recovery from a decade-long opioid addiction). Hamptonreported raising$125,000 in the first quarter and has more than $200,000 in cash on hand. His haul included donations from addiction recovery groups — We Stand for Recovery ($10,000) and Get Help ($8,000) — and legislators, including $2,000 each from Jauregui and Yeager. He also received $10,000 from a California law firm that has filed opioid litigation. Meanwhile, Lisa Cole, a conservative businesswoman backed by Lombardo,raised around $51,000in the first quarter and has around $88,000 in cash on hand. She received $2,500 from the Nevada Way PAC, another $2,500 from the Clark County Firefighters PAC and $1,000 each from Kasama and Assemblywoman Alexis Hansen (R-Sparks). In the northwestern Las Vegas district, nonpartisans make up the largest share of registered voters, while Republicans have a narrow voter registration advantage over Democrats. Without any primary challengers, both candidates will advance to the general election. Tides turn in Assembly District 37 Earlier this year, the GOP groups pounced on a fundraising lead in Democrat-controlled Assembly District 37. Republican David Brog in 2023 more than doubled the fundraising haul of incumbent Assemblywoman Shea Backus (D-Las Vegas). A Lombardo-affiliated PACtweetedthat Brog was “well-positioned to flip this crucial seat.” Three months later, the tides have shifted. Backusreported raising$63,000 in the first quarter, buoyed by a $10,000 donation from a PAC led by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) and $25,000 from other legislators, including Yeager and state Sen. Fabian Doñate (D-Las Vegas). She reported  around $140,000 in cash on hand. Brog, who is running unopposed in the June primary,reported raising$32,000 in the first quarter and has around $130,000 in cash on hand. He received $10,000 from Miriam Adelson and $2,500 from the Nevada Way PAC. The race is likely to be close. Backus won her 2022 race by around 800 votes and lost the same race in 2020 by a similar margin. Democrats have a slight voter registration advantage in the Summerlin-area district. Six remaining districts In the six other competitive districts, five incumbents running for re-election far outraised the candidate backed by the opposite party who will likely face them in the general election. Assembly District 29, which is open after Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen (D-Las Vegas) announced she would not run for re-election, the Lombardo-backed Republican candidate, Annette Dawson Owens, outraised Democrat Joe Dalia by nearly $12,000. Daliareported raisingmore than $13,200 during the first quarter, compared toDawson Owens’ almost $25,200. However, Dalia spent $2,500 more in campaign expenses and had a war chest of nearly $123,200 in cash on hand heading into the primary, while Dawson Owens had about $51,000 in cash on hand. Dawson Owens’ received $500 each from Assemblyman P.K. O’Neill (R-Carson City) and Assemblyman Ken Gray (R-Dayton). She also received $2,500 from the Nevada Way PAC, $5,000 from the M Resort and $500 from the Nevadans for Integrity in Politics PAC, which is a PAC registered with former Sen. Keith Pickard (R-Henderson). Dalia received $2,500 from a PAC associated with Laborers Local 872, $2,500 from Southwest Gas, $1,000 from Assemblywoman Elaine Marzola (D-Henderson), $1,000 from New Day Nevada PAC and $1,000 from former state Sen. Joyce Woodhouse (D-Henderson). In other competitive Southern Nevada legislative races: In the only Northern Nevada district where a Lombardo-backed candidate is preparing to square off against a Democratic incumbent — Assembly District 25 — AssemblywomanSelena La Rue Hatch (D-Reno), raised $16,200 more than her Republican challenger,Diana Sande. The district, which includes portions of southwestern Reno, is considered a swing district. Kasama reportedraising nearly $153,000 more than her Democratic challenger, businessmanRonald Nelsen, who only reported raising $2,100. Nelsen announced his bid on March 15, two weeks before the fundraising quarter ended. The majority of the funding Kasama reported raising came in the form of a $129,200 refund from a super PAC that she had donated to before dropping her congressional bid in favor of running for re-election.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/establishment-backed-candidates-have-financial-lead-in-key-legislative-primaries,True,"With less than two months to go before Nevada’s June 11 primary, establishment-backed candidates in key legislative races generally have the financial edge over their opponents heading into the final pre-election stretch. In nine legislative races tracked byThe Nevada Independent, all but one of the candidates backed by either Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) or their party’s caucus in their respective chamber held a significant lead in money raised from January through March, according to an analysis of first quarter campaign finance reports released last week. Though 10 state Senate races and 42 Assembly races are on the ballot in 2024,The Nevada Independentidentified nine potentially competitive or notable races where either the winner is effectively guaranteed to prevail in November because of a lopsided party registration breakdown in the district, or because the winner will take part in a closely watched general election that could determine whether Lombardo keeps his veto power. Democrats control 13 seats in the 21-member state Senate (one short of a two-thirds supermajority needed to override a veto) and 27 seats in the 42-member Assembly. The campaign finance reports released last week are the last reports legislative candidates will have to file before the state’s June 11 primary — the next quarterly reporting deadline is in July, about a month after the election. Financial advantages do not necessarily lead to electoral success, but more money raised allows candidates to spend more on anything from advertising to campaign supplies. ANevada Independentanalysisfound that more than two-thirds of winners in close legislative elections since 2016 had a fundraising lead at the start of the election year. Here’s how the money breaks down in the key legislative primaries in the first quarter, separated by races that will be effectively or actually decided in the primary and those likely to be competitive in the general election. Values above $1,000 have been rounded to the nearest $100. The partisan lean was determined based on voter registration data and prior election results. RACES DECIDED IN THE PRIMARY Senate District 1 Democratic primary Michelee ""Shelly"" Crawford Assemblywoman Clara Thomas (D-North Las Vegas) Crawford, who’s endorsed by the Senate Democratic Caucus, raised almost nine times as much as Thomas in the open North Las Vegas state Senate seat held by termed-out Sen. Pat Spearman (D-North Las Vegas). Crawford, a regent and principal, received $5,000 from a Southern Nevada building trades union and Citizens for Justice, the political arm of the Nevada Justice Association, a trade association for trial lawyers. She also received $2,500 from the New Day Nevada PAC, a group tied to Democratic consultants, and $100 from former state Sen. Joyce Woodhouse (D-Las Vegas). Thomas, meanwhile, only reported raising around $3,000 in the first quarter. She received $1,000 from North Las Vegas City Councilman Scott Black, $500 from North Las Vegas Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown and $500 from Las Vegas mayoral candidate Shelley Berkley. The election winner will likely be decided in the primary because of the district’s heavy Democratic lean. Assembly District 27 Democratic primary Alex Velto Heather Goulding Velto, an attorney endorsed by the Assembly Democratic Caucus, had a slight fundraising lead over Goulding, a longtime Northern Nevadan who has done work with community organizations focused on breast cancer and high school dropouts. Velto’s top donor was Citizens for Justice, which donated $7,500. He also received $3,000 from Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) and $1,000 donations from Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas), Assemblywoman Elaine Marzola (D-Las Vegas) and Assemblywoman Brittney Miller (D-Las Vegas). Goulding had a much higher share of small-dollar donations, including $120 from former state Sen. Yvanna Cancela (D-Las Vegas). Democrats have a voter registration advantage in the northern Reno district, so the primary winner will likely be elected in November. The seat is open after Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno) decided to run for the open Senate District 15 election. Senate District 3 Democratic primary Sen. Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas) Geoconda Hughes Nguyen raised $65,000 more than Hughes, a nurse practitioner who is backed by the Culinary Union. Nguyen received a $10,000 donation from Assemblyman Howard Watts (D-Las Vegas) and $5,000 from New Day Nevada PAC, a group linked to Democratic consultants. Hughes raised less than $7,000 in the first quarter after announcing her candidacy just a few weeks before the quarter ended. She received $1,000 from fellow state Senate candidate Christian Bishop and $1,000 from her mother, Geoconda Arguello-Kline, the former secretary-treasurer for Culinary Local 226. The Democratic primary winner of this deep-blue district in central Las Vegas is essentially guaranteed to win in November. Senate District 4 Democratic primary Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) Laura Perkins In the primary for Senate District 4, which covers portions of North Las Vegas, Neal outraised her primary competitor Perkins, a Nevada System of Higher Education regent, by more than $12,700. Neal also outspent Perkins and has a larger war chest of more than $26,800 in cash on hand. Neal received $5,000 from the Citizens for Justice, $1,000 from T-Mobile, $1,000 from the New Day Nevada PAC and $1,000 from Anthem Blue Cross. Perkins received donations from American Nevada Holdings LLC and LA Wireless. The primary winner will likely be heading to Carson City because no other candidates filed to run in the heavily Democratic district. Senate District 18 Republican primary John Steinbeck Assemblyman Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas) Josh Leavitt Of the three Republican contenders in the open Senate seat in the northwestern Las Vegas Valley, Clark County Fire Chief John Steinbeck, whom Lombardo has endorsed, led the first quarter fundraising by more than $43,500. He was followed by Assemblyman Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas), who supported himself with a $20,000 loan, and Josh Leavitt, the CEO and Founder of IONnovate, LLC, an application development firm. Notable donations to Steinbeck included $5,000 from Lombardo’s Nevada Way PAC, $5,000 from Golden Entertainment, $5,000 from Resorts World, $1,500 from Assemblyman Toby Yurek (R-Las Vegas) and $1,500 from Democratic Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson. Steinbeck also outspent his competitors. Three Democrats are also competing in the primary, though the Senate Democratic Caucus has not endorsed in the race. The district has a Republican voter advantage. Senate District 19 Republican primary John Ellison William Eric Hockstedler Chelsy Fischer In a Republican primary race that will determine who represents the ruby-red Senate district because no Democrat filed, Ellison — a former assemblyman — is the fundraising front-runner. The district covers a vast swath of rural Nevada, including Lincoln and White Pine counties and parts of Clark, Elko, Eureka and Nye counties. Endorsed by Lombardo, Ellison raised $10,000 more than his nearest competitor, Hockstedler, an Army and Air Force veteran who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2022. Hockstedler is mainly supported by an approximately $1,500 loan to himself. Ellison’s highest donations include $5,000 from personal injury attorney Craig Kidwell, $2,500 from R&S Leasing and $1,500 from Nevada Auto Dealers. Fischer, a Nye County School Board trustee, raised the least out of the three Republican contenders, reporting only a $350 loan to herself. COMPETITIVE PRIMARY, COMPETITIVE GENERAL ELECTION Assembly District 21 Republican primary April Arndt Jon Petrick Arndt, a retired police officer endorsed by Lombardo last year, is the lone establishment candidate in a key primary with a financial disadvantage after raising $6,000 less than her primary opponent Petrick, a chiropractor and the CEO of a Las Vegas pain relief center. Arndt received $5,000 from the pro-Lombardo Nevada Way PAC ($2,500 coming last year) and donations from Assembly members Ken Gray (R-Dayton) and P.K. O’Neill (R-Carson City). Meanwhile, Petrick’s top donation ($5,800) came from Jon McMahon, a Las Vegas real estate agent. He also received $5,000 from James Thomson, a frequent Republican donor, and $2,500 from a development group in Henderson. The primary winner will face Assemblywoman Elaine Marzola (D-Las Vegas) in the general election to represent this blue-leaning district primarily covering south central Las Vegas. Senate District 5 Democratic primary Jennifer Atlas Christian Bishop In swingy Senate District 5, which covers parts of Henderson and Paradise, two Democrats are squaring off in the primary for a chance to challenge the district’s representative, Sen. Carrie Buck (R-Henderson). The Democratic Caucus-endorsed candidate, Atlas, raised almost double that of her Democratic challenger Bishop in the first quarter. Bishop, however, outspent Atlas. Bishop has a slightly higher cash-on-hand advantage over Atlas heading into the second quarter, but 34 percent of it consists of a $25,000 contribution he gave himself inDecember. Atlas drew a $5,000 donation from the Citizens for Justice, $5,000 from Yeager’s Nevada Strong PAC and $2,500 from the Laborers International Union Local 169. She also drew $5,000 from Yeager and $1,000 from Jauregui. State Sen. Skip Daly (D-Sparks) donated $5,000 and Attorney General Aaron Ford (D) donated $1,000 to her campaign. Bishop’s highest donations came from Las Vegas residents Minddie Lloyd, who donated $1,000 to his campaign, and Merila Tinio, who donated $500. Senate District 15 Democratic primary Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno) Reno City Councilmember Naomi Duerr Johnny Kerns Three Democrats and three Republicans are competing in primary races in Northern Nevada’s Senate District 15, open after Sen. Heidi Seevers Gansert (R-Reno) opted not to run for re-election. The district includes much of the northern and western edges of Reno and leans in favor of Democrats. In the Democratic primary, Senate Democratic Caucus-endorsed Taylor outraised Duerr, a Reno city councilwoman, by more than $40,700. Duerr, a geologist by training, received $2,500 from the Reno Engineering Corps, $2,500 from the Atlantis Casino Resort, $2,500 from Nevada Mine Properties and $500 from Reno City Council candidate Kathleen Taylor. In her last election for city council, Duerr was outraised by her opponent, Jay Kenny, the owner of DoughBoys Donuts, but defeated him in the general election. Taylor, who served on the Washoe County School Board for eight years before being elected to the Assembly last cycle, received $5,000 from the New Day Nevada PAC, $5,000 from the NV Resort PAC, $5,000 from Yeager, $2,500 from the Ferraro Group and $2,000 from the Nevada State Education Association. Not much information is available on the third candidate, who is primarily supported by a self-donation of $1,000. Senate District 15 Republican primary Mike Ginsburg Sharron Angle Charles Mark Neumann Ginsburg, a longtime member of the Builders Association of Northern Nevada who spent more than 39 years working in the energy industry, raised about $8,100 more than the second-highest fundraiser during the first quarter. Though Lombardo has not endorsed Ginsburg, he did receive an endorsement from the Nevada Senate Republican Caucus, Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony and Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus (R-Wellington). Ginsburg also gave himself a $1,000 loan. His campaign finance reports list a $5,000 donation from Seevers Gansert. He also received a $5,000 donation from the NV First PAC, which Seevers Gansert established, and a $1,000 loan. Angle served in the Nevada Assembly from 1999 to 2007 and rose to the national stage with the Tea Party movement during an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate against late Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) in 2010. She gave herself a $3,900 self-loan. Angle’s reported spending centers around advertising and candidate filing costs similar to Ginsburg, who has focused on advertising and office expenses. Neumann reported raising no money during the first quarter.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/millions-roll-in-to-nevada-ballot-initiatives-from-unions-uber-and-dark-money-groups,True,"The political action committees behind a slew of potential Nevada ballot questions received nearly $8 million from January to March, with millions of dollars coming from the Clark County Education Association and Uber and six-figure contributions from left-leaning “dark money” groups. In addition to the five initiatives guaranteed to be on the 2024 ballot, there are several active ballot petitions in Nevada, which would either be posed to voters in November or the Legislature next year if supporters gather enough signatures and pass legal scrutiny. These proposals include efforts to enshrine abortion rights in Nevada’s Constitution, cap attorney fees at 20 percent in state civil cases and allow teachers the right to strike. The groups supporting (or opposing) these initiatives were required to submit, by Monday, campaign finance reports for the first three months of 2024, which shed light on how much money they have raised and how much they spent on anything from advertising and polling to consultants. The initiatives must receive at least 102,362 signatures — split evenly across the four congressional districts — to move forward. There is no limit on how much a person or organization can donate to a state-level PAC in Nevada, and PACs are not legally required to report their cash on hand amount or donations less than $1,000. A’s stadium public funding repeal The PAC behind the referendum to overturn the public financing deal to bring the Oakland Athletics to Las Vegas onlyreported raising $3,000(all from donors in California) in the first quarter. Schools over Stadiums reported spending more than $23,000 during the period, all to the law firm that is helping the group appeal a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of its petition language, whichis still pendingin the state Supreme Court. It’s not yet clear whether the measure will appear on the ballot because of the pending legal challenge and signature requirements. The PAC also held a fundraising event on the final day of the reporting period where a donor committed $100,000 in matching funds, but a representative from the PAC — which the Nevada State Education Association is supporting — said it did not receive the money raised until after the reporting period closed. The representative added that the group’s average donation is $91.67, with around $161,000  in cash on hand as of the end of March. Uber and CCEA The Clark County Education Associationpoured $2 millionin the first quarter into an initiative to allow licensed public school educators to go on strike, which is currently illegal under state law. These donations represent, by far, the union’s largest donations related to a ballot initiative, with the previous single-donation record being $250,000 from the union for a2020 effort to raise the state sales tax. It’s not yet clear whether the measure will appear on the ballot, and there are no active legal challenges, the union said. The other major donation this quarter came from Uber, which contributed $4 million to the proposal tocap attorney fees at 20 percentof all awards and settlements in Nevada civil cases. The initiativeis being challengedin court, and it’s unclear whether voters will weigh in on it in November. The ride-sharing company’s previous highest donation in Nevada was $25,000. ‘Dark money’ contributions to abortion, payday petitions A major source of donations to ballot initiatives this quarter came from a national, left-leaning “dark money” group called the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a nonprofit that does not have to disclose its donors andspent nearly $800 millionon progressive causes from 2020 to 2022. The group previously gave $6.25 million to the PAC behind a 2018 ballot initiative to automate voter registration at the DMV. In the first quarter of 2024, Sixteen Thirty Fund gave $500,000 to Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, the group leading the effort to enshrine abortion rights in the state Constitution. Although the ballot measure language has cleared one legal hurdle, it has not yet formally qualified for the ballot.The group’s$1.4 million haulin the quarter also included $500,000 from a separate dark money group called the Nevada Alliance and donations from several national abortion rights organizations. Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom raised$1.8 million last year— including a $1 million donation from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s nonprofit — and spent more than $2 million in the first quarter, mostly on consulting. The Sixteen Thirty Fund also gave $110,000 to Stop Predatory Lending NV, the nonprofit behindthe proposalto place a 36 percent annual cap on the interest rates for certain categories of high-interest loans, includingpaydayandtitle loans. The group also received $150,000 from the Hopewell Fund, another “dark money” nonprofit, fora total of $260,000raised in the quarter. The group is gathering signatures, anda judge approveda narrower version of the proposal last month. A separate PAC called Nevadans for Financial Choice is opposing the high-interest loan initiative and raised$290,000in the first quarter, with donations from various lending companies including Dollar Loan Center ($50,000), Checksmart Financial ($50,000) and Moneytree ($25,000). These businesses are regulated by the state’s Financial Institutions Division, but state law places no maximum cap on the interest rates that can be attached to a loan. Other petitions Repair the Vote, a PAC led by former Nevada Republican Club president and former Clark County GOP Chair David Gibbs,received $100,000from Allen Knudson, a Henderson resident who had not made a state political donation in six years, for its voter ID proposal. If successful, the initiative would require people voting in person to provide valid photo identification, and those voting by mail to provide a personally identifiable number — part of a driver’s license or Social Security number — alongside their signature. Though the petitionovercamea legal challenge in February, the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which will hear oral arguments surrounding the case on May 8.  A Repair the Vote representative did not provide information on the status of signature gathering. The PAC supporting the question to strike the Nevada Board of Regents from the state Constitution received $40,000 in the first quarter. Len Jessup, the former UNLV president whofeuded with the board, gave $2,500. The regents question is guaranteed to be on the ballot. All quiet on the fundraising front Fair Maps Nevada, a group that has proposed creating an independent redistricting commission to redraw the state’s congressional and legislative maps, did not file a campaign finance report for the first quarter. The legality of the proposal is alsobefore the state Supreme Court, so it is unclear whether it will land on the general election ballot. The groupssupportingandopposingthe proposal to adopt ranked choice voting in state elections — which is guaranteed to be on the November ballot — did not report raising any money in the first quarter.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nv-supreme-court-says-broader-abortion-ballot-question-is-constitutional,True,"The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled in favor of granting ballot access to a broad “reproductive freedom” ballot question seeking to enshrine rights to a wide range of birth control, fertility and abortion options into the state Constitution — though the group supporting the initiative is already moving forward with a proposal more narrowly tailored to abortion access. The16-page decisionreleased Thursday overturneda lower court’s rulingthat said inclusion of topics such as prenatal care, abortions, vasectomies and infertility care under the umbrella of “reproductive rights” within a single ballot question was unconstitutional because the framing was too broad. “[A]ll the medical procedures considered in the initiative petition concern reproduction. To assert that they could not all be addressed together because they are separate procedures is improper,” read the opinion, which was signed by six of seven justices on the court. Justice Patricia Lee recused herself from the case because of a professional conflict of interest. But the ruling will likely not affect the petition’s chances of landing on the November ballot, as the group supporting it — Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom — has said it intends to prioritize collecting signatures on a narrower petition that focuses only on abortion rights. The high court will also rule on the constitutionality of that proposal — whichreceived approvalfrom a lower court judge in January — though Thursday’s opinion indicates that it is almost sure to pass legal muster from the state’s high court. Abortion is already legal through 24 weeks into a pregnancy in Nevadabecause of a 1990 referendum, which can only be overturned by a majority vote of the people. Abortion rights advocates say that enshrining similar language in the state Constitution would make it even harder to overturn. Though Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom does not plan to bring the broader petition to the ballot this year, the organization still celebrated the decision. “Protecting these rights is essential to ensuring that all Nevadans maintain full control over their own lives, especially as we continue to see attacks on abortion, IVF, birth control, and other reproductive health services,” Lindsey Harmon, the group’s president, said in a statement. Thursday’s ruling overturned a Carson City District Court judge’sNovember decisionthat the proposal was unconstitutional because it violated a rule requiring that any ballot initiative only focus on a single subject. Jason Guinasso, the lawyer representing the group challenging the proposal, said in a statement that the ruling would set a precedent to allow overly broad ballot initiatives. “The Court has transformed the single-subject rule into the single-category rule, which will open the floodgates to broad and deceptive initiative proposals like the one at issue in this case,” the statement said. “My clients will now focus on educating the voters on why this proposal is bad law and policy for Nevadans.” To make it on the ballot, petition supporters still must gather 102,362 signatures from voters by June 26, with at least 25,591 signatures coming from each of the state’s four congressional districts. Nevadans for Reproductive Freedomsaidearlier this month that it was halfway to its signature goal and “on track” to meet the signature deadline, though it did not offer specifics on how many signatures it had gathered from each congressional district. The ballot initiatives are part of a concerted effort by Nevada Democrats to strengthen abortion protections in hopes that theissue’s popularity will help propel Democrats to victorythis year. Democratsbenefited politicallyafter the June 2022overturningofRoe v. Wade, and the party is now hoping to continue capitalizing on that enthusiasm — apolllast year indicated that more than 60 percent of Nevadans across all parties support adding abortion rights to the Constitution. Thursday’s ruling also bolsters a legislative effort to enshrine protections for a broad range of reproductive health care procedures in the Nevada Constitution. Thatproposal, which has essentially identical language as the one approved by the Supreme Court on Thursday, passed the Legislature last year and must pass again in 2025 for it to appear on the 2026 ballot. In a Thursday statement, Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas), who sponsored the legislative effort, said state lawmakers in 2025 will consider additional measures to protect fertility treatment options, birth control and other reproductive health services. “It has always been abundantly clear that reproductive rights encompass the full scope of reproductive health care services, and today’s unanimous Nevada Supreme Court unequivocally reaffirms that principle,” she said in the statement.This story was updated on 4/18/2024 at 2:29 p.m. to include a statement from Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and on 4/19/2024 at 8:25 a.m. to include a statement from Jason Guinasso.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-house-democrats-keep-war-chest-lead-self-funding-gop-candidates-narrow-gap,True,"Though Nevada’s congressional Democrats have maintained their cash advantages through the first quarter of 2024, many Republican challengers are attempting to close the gap through six-figure loans to themselves that make up the bulk of their hauls. Monday marked the deadline for congressional candidates to submit their quarterly fundraising reports to the Federal Election Commission for the first three months of 2024, the last full quarter before the June 11 primaries. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) again proved the state’s most prolific fundraiser,raisinga whopping $5 million and accumulating a war chest of $13.2 million — much of which has poured intoad reservationsto be on the airwaves from late July through the general election in November. Meanwhile, in the competitive Republican primary to take on Rosen, former Ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter technically reported the biggest quarterly haul of $2.87 million. However, $2.7 million of that came via a loan from Gunter himself, meaning front-runner Sam Brown, a veteran backed by national Republicans, dominated the GOP field in terms of contributions, posting a $2.4 million quarter — his best yet. And in the House, where the three Las Vegas-based Democrats are running for re-election incompetitive seats, six self-funded Republicans across the districts have loaned their campaigns hundreds of thousands of dollars to attempt to narrow the playing field. Candidates’ loans from themselves do not need to be fully expended. Brown dominating Senate GOP field Brown’s $2.4 million fundraising quarter is leagues ahead of the rest of the GOP field and a significant improvement on where former Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the Republican Senate nominee in 2022,stood at this pointlast cycle when he reported raising $1.6 million. Other GOP candidates had comparably lackluster quarters.  Gunter — whom surrogates have beenpitchingto Donald Trump as a Brown alternative — raised about $145,000 this quarter. But the cash on hand battle is a different story because Gunter has the ability to self-fund. Buoyed by the $2.7 million loaned to his campaign, the former ambassador has $2.9 million in cash on hand compared to Brown’s $2.4 million. Gunter’s self-funding has allowed him to beginairing television ads— the first Senate Republican candidate to do so. Brown also spent much more than Gunter in the first quarter — $1.8 million to about $330,000 — on travel, direct mail and fundraising services, salaries and consulting, and other expenses. The majority of Gunter’s campaign spending was repaying himself $195,000 from a prior loan to the campaign — a similar type of transaction to the one at the heart of Gunter’s attacks onBrownover using PAC funds torepaycampaign debt from his 2022 run. Outside of Brown and Gunter, no other candidates reported raising more than six figures in the quarter. Air Force veteran Tony Grady pulled in nearly $69,000, while former Assembly member and secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant raised $49,000. But it all pales in comparison to Rosen’s record-breaking quarter. She more than doubled what Brown raised and received money from over 6,000 unique donors. She also benefited from the strength of Democratic digital fundraising platform ActBlue, pulling in more than $1.4 million aggregated through the platform, which haspoweredDemocratic fundraising strength since the Trump era by allowing easy processing for small donations and Democratic campaign coordination. Rosen and Brown once again had the most geographically diverse donor base. The incumbent had unique donors from all 50 states — just as she did in thefourth quarter of 2023— with the most donors once again coming from California and Nevada. This quarter, there were more than 1,200 unique California donors (giving more than $530,000 combined) and 900 unique Nevada donors (bringing in more than $240,000 combined). Meanwhile, Brown had donors from 49 states (all except Rhode Island). Nevada led the way with 424 unique donors who combined gave nearly $300,000. Brown is leaning more heavily on big-dollar donors, given that he raised more money from Nevada than Rosen with fewer than half the number of donors. Gunter also had donors from 38 states — an increase of 16 from last cycle — but only had 13 unique donors in Nevada, the same number as Marchant. These numbers do not include donations from popular fundraising platforms ActBlue or WinRed, and are based only on itemized donations — generally those of $200 or more — for which the federal government requires more reporting about the donor's identity. House Republican self-funders Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) has consistently been the best-funded House candidate in Nevada this cycle, and this quarter was no exception — Lee raised more than $850,000, which her campaign says is a Nevada first-quarter record among House candidates. On the Republican side in Congressional District 3, former state Treasurer Dan Schwartz and video game music composer Marty O’Donnell reported loaning their campaigns hundreds of thousands of dollars to compete with Lee’s cash advantage. Outside of the loans, Schwartz raised $18,000 and O’Donnell raised nearly $24,000. But the two Republicans lended their own campaigns $800,000 and $500,000, respectively, leveling the playing field with Lee. Candidates Drew Johnson, a tax analyst, and Elizabeth Helgelien, a former state senator, raised about $36,000 each, though Johnson also loaned his campaign $200,000. Lee — a prolific fundraiser who has significantlyoutraisedthe average House candidate — maintains a large cash on hand advantage. The three-term congresswoman has nearly $2.2 million in her war chest — more than double that of Schwartz, who has nearly $725,000, and four times as much as O’Donnell, with about $477,000. In Congressional District 4, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) lost his long-standing fundraising advantage after one of his opponents made a $500,000 loan to his own campaign, but the incumbent still maintains a significant lead in cash on hand. Horsford brought in more than $560,000 in the first quarter, about $50,000 less than the total raised by Republican John Lee, the former mayor of North Las Vegas, whose half a million dollar loan brought his quarterly haul to more than $615,000. Still, Horsford has more than $1.6 million in cash on hand — $1 million more than Lee. Air Force veteran David Flippo, who is running against Lee in the GOP primary, brought in just $14,000, on top of a $125,000 campaign loan from himself. He has around $290,000 in cash on hand. Lee and Horsford, whose races areamong the handfulconsidered competitive enough to determine control of the House, bothrankin the top 70 for House fundraising thus far this cycle, out of more than 2,500 candidates. And in Congressional District 1, Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) bested her opponents in fundraising this quarter for the first time since the second quarter of 2023. Titus raised about $425,000, beating out GOP opponent and restaurateur Flemming Larsen, who raised about $278,000 (of which $250,000 was a loan). Mark Robertson, who was the GOP nominee in the district last cycle, raised nearly $20,000. Larsen has about $1.5 million in the bank — though most of it is in the form of loans — to Titus’ cash on hand total of nearly $983,000. All three House Democrats have benefited from outside groups spending heavily to defend the seats. Once Republican nominees are decided, outside groups aligned with House Republican leaders will also likely swoop in and drop millions of dollars to boost their candidates in Las Vegas. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), the lone Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, is facing an independent challenge from Greg Kidd, an Incline Village-based entrepreneur. Amodei raised $117,000 in the first quarter and has $440,000 in cash on hand. Kidd’s $500,000 haul came exclusively from a loan from himself, and he has $415,000 cash on hand.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/a-year-after-reclaiming-state-party-from-socialists-are-nv-dems-building-back-better,True,"A little over a year ago, Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-North Las Vegas) was elected chair of the Nevada State Democratic Party. It was an effort that had been in the making since a group of Sen. Bernie Sanders-inspired socialists took over the party in 2021, setting off achain reactionthat saw the old party faithful depart and form a shadow organization in Washoe County. A year after taking back the helm, “DMM” has overseen the rebuilding of the state party through the hiring of permanent staffers, the implementation of quarterly weekends of service to engage volunteers and the all-important task of raising money. Her leadership has marked a return to the practices that former Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) and the eponymous Machine he implemented and ran for nearly two decades. Of course, it wasn’t like the establishment quietly faded into the background last cycle. Working out of Nevada Democratic Victory, a side organization they set up within the Washoe County Democratic Party, they still served as a hub for each of the major Democratic campaigns in the state. And 2022 was far from a disaster — in what was supposed to be a down year for Democrats, the party held on to its U.S. Senate seat, three House seats and picked up a seat in each chamber of the Legislature. Only Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) was unable to hold onto his post, more a casualty of sour feelings on the economy and the pandemic than ofDemocratic disputes. So, is it meaningful that the Reid Machine is once again pulling the levers of the state party? Democrats working for the state party and for 2024 campaigns say it matters in a few key aspects — brand name, financial strength and dedicated staff among them. For one, it’s just less effort. “It was certainly a lot of work to get that new organization set up and running, which is not the work you want to be doing in the off year,” said Stewart Boss, Sen. Jacky Rosen’s (D-NV) campaign manager, describing 2021. “You want to be laying the groundwork to prosecute the case against Republicans.” On the financial piece, records show that when Monroe-Moreno took over in early 2023, the state party hadaccumulatednearly $100,000 in debt. Party leadership said a year later, the Dems have more than $1 million cash on hand. State parties are tasked with winning elections — and being able to hire people on a permanent basis allows for recruiting better talent, said Molly Forgey, who served as Sisolak’s deputy campaign manager in 2022. “Having the stability of a state party and being able to say, ‘We want you to be a part of this core team that is going to operate year round, and not just this brief, short stint,’ — that's really helpful,” she said. “It allows you to hire the best of the best.” Staff inside and outside of the party mentioned Monroe-Moreno’s focus on diversity in hiring as an asset, given how much Democrats rely on a multiracial coalition to win. She brought in three department heads who are both native Nevadans and Spanish speakers and chartered several new identity-focused caucuses, including for Jewish Democrats, Asian American and Pacific Islander Democrats, seniors, women and LGBTQIA+ Democrats. In an interview, Monroe-Moreno also described bringing a culture of retail politics to the state party — the weekends of service often involve staffers helping out at food drives or school fairs, building relationships with Democratic voters who may then feel empowered to become volunteers. She mentioned the state party responding to calls from everyone from tribal members wanting to discuss issues they want the Legislature to take up, to seniors who need someone to check out a community center with them — in other words, old-school shoe leather politics. “We have boots on the ground,” Monroe-Moreno said. “My theme is to show up and show out — to be there for people.” The vast majority of the staff hires also come from Nevada — “emphasizing the institutional knowledge and experience that we have,” said Paul Selberg, a former Nevada Conservation League executive director who added that Monroe-Moreno’s position in the Assembly means the bottom of the ballot isn’t ignored. Hiring rates have proven a major difference between Nevada’s two state parties. Democrats are currently operating with a team of eight full-time staff — with a ninth joining later this week — while Republicans hadoneduring the February caucus. The Nevada GOP did not return requests for comment on the party's current staffing levels. Forgey also added that whether introducing herself to volunteers, donors or voters, staffers saying they’re with the state party is a much simpler sell than having to explain, as they did last cycle, that they worked for an offshoot group with far lower name identification. When former chair Judith Whitmer was in charge of the party, elected Democrats in Nevada worked both publicly and privately to take back control of the party’s central committee in order to be in the best position to ensure victory in the 2023 chair election. Those elected officials were able to coordinate their campaigns with the offshoot group, but whether or not that made a difference in reality — given most of them still won — it was clearly important to Democratic leaders to have the state party back under their preferred leadership come 2024. But Democrats are not the only elected officials engaging in party building. On the other side, Gov. Joe Lombardo (R-NV) isbuilding outhis own campaign machine, using a patchwork of political action committees and funds to send money to endorsed candidates, groups and consultants. While Reid intentionally built out his machinery through the state party, Lombardo is choosing to create separate entities away from a Nevada GOP embroiled inlegal woes. So perhaps the best test of whether a well-oiled state party matters will come this cycle, when the state Democratic Party squares off against the Lombardo apparatus in the state’s myriad significant down-ballot races. Monroe-Moreno said well-run state parties are like parents — keeping all other elements of the partisan family together and on schedule. “It takes that state party — that mom and dad, that family — to bring us together to work as a coordinated team,” she said. “I think that's a difference between us and the GOP.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lawyers-debate-if-taking-redistricting-out-of-legislatures-hands-will-cost-more-money,True,"The Nevada Supreme Court heard arguments Thursday over an effort to invalidate two proposed ballot questions seeking to establish an independent redistricting commission. At issue: whether the change would create additional expenses that the ballot measure isn’t prepared to pay. The nearly 40-minute arguments on Thursday surrounded an appeal of a Carson City judge’sFebruary rulingthat the petitions filed by Fair Maps Nevadawould violate the Nevada Constitutionby creating an unfunded mandate. The two petitions are identical, save that one would have called for an independent commission to redraw the state’s congressional and legislative maps in 2027 at the earliest and one by the next redistricting cycle in 2031. Fair Maps says the 2031 proposal should be cost-neutral because the timeline aligns with redistricting that is already planned. Supporters, whofiled the ballot questionsin mid-November, have argued that an independent redistricting commission would remove partisan biases from the redistricting process, which in Nevada is handled by the Legislature. They say it will help undo district gerrymanders that have minimized some voters at the expense of others in pursuit of maximizing partisan control of legislative bodies. Two prominent Democrat-aligned law firms filed legal challenges against the petitions on behalf of Las Vegas-based Democratic voter Eric Jeng, arguing that the petitions are constitutionally invalid because they would create an unfunded mandate. Nevada’s electoral maps were last redrawn during the decennial redistricting process in 2021. However, under unified Democratic control of the Legislature and Gov. Steve Sisolak, those maps were drawn to maximize the number of competitive districtsfavoring Democratsin congressional and legislative races. Sondra Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada professor who has helped lead the ballot initiative process, has said that because the petition would replace one funded body with another, that the same funds used to support the Legislature during the redistricting process could instead be used to pay for the envisioned commission. Historically, the seven-member Supreme Court does not issue decisions from the bench and is expected to issue a decision in the coming months. Attorney Adam Hosmer-Henner with McDonald Carano represented Fair Maps Nevada in the hearing. He said Thursday that the unfunded mandate accusation is “unfounded speculation” and there was no evidence from the opposing party that the independent commission would incur extra costs. “This doesn’t compel the legislators to spend any more or less than they have in previous years,” Hosmer-Henner said. “This independent commission is within the legislative branch and its funding is received from the legislative branch as part of the Legislature’s general fund.”Pressed by justices about costs that will inevitably take place as a result of the redistricting process, Hosmer-Henner said funding used for redistricting can be repurposed to pay for an independent commission. “We’re simply saying this is the way government is done and we want to do it slightly differently,” he said, adding that the Legislature does not set aside money in the state budget for redistricting, instead pulling it out of the state’s general fund. In a rebuttal, attorney David Fox, representing the ballot proposals’ opponents, said that creating the commission will require the Legislature to add a new expenditure without establishing a funding source. “The basic problem is simple,” said Fox, who works for Elias Law Group, one of the most prominent firms representing Democrats in election-related cases around the country. “The petitions create a new government body — the redistricting commission — and they mandate that it carry out a mandatory and complicated task. The condition will require funding to achieve that task, and the Legislature will have to provide it.” There is also “issue preclusion,” Fox said, meaning the defendants had already litigated and lost similar challenges to the structure of the ballot question in 2020 and had not made changes reflective of that decision in the initiative's current form. Asked by justices about the argument that moving money that is already in existence means costs won’t rise, Fox said state law restricts how general fund dollars (which are used to pay for redistricting costs every ten years) can be used and wouldn’t allow the Legislature to pay for an independent commission. Fox said past decisions around the issue show that the funding mechanism does not need to be placed into the Constitution and could be a statutory change. If the court rules in favor of Fair Maps Nevada, the organization will have fewer than 75 days to collect 102,362 valid voter signatures, including at least 25,591 from each of the state’s four congressional districts by June 26, to qualify for the upcoming election. If a petition receives enough signatures and a simple majority of Nevadans vote in favor of the corresponding ballot question, it would pass and be placed on the ballot again in 2026; an affirmative vote in that election would add the language to the state Constitution. This is Fair Maps Nevada’s third run at a proposed redistricting commission ballot measure, with unsuccessful efforts in 2020 and 2022. According toBallotpedia, 13 states use commissions for congressional redistricting, and 18 use them for legislative redistricting, with the vast majority of commissions not populated by those in elected office. However,researchfrom the Loyola Marymount University law program indicates that legislatures control redistricting in most states. The new maps helped create a supermajority for Democrats in the Assembly and near-supermajority in the Senate in 2022, even as Republican Joe Lombardo bested Sisolak in the race for governor and Nevada is generally considered a purple state. A potential veto-proof supermajority ison the table againin the 2024 election, which could allow Democrats to stymie Lombardo’s agenda just two years after he issueda record number of vetoes. An analysis by Princeton University’sGerrymandering Projectgave Nevada’s congressional maps an “F” grade for partisan competitiveness, citing a “significant” Democratic advantage. The project found more subtle advantages in legislative maps, giving the state Senate map a “B” grade for a “slight” Democratic advantage and leaving the Assembly map ungraded. Split control of state governmenthas shaped past Nevada redistricting fights. In 2011, Republican Gov. Brian Sandovaltwice vetoedmaps proposed by the Democrat-controlled Legislature, sending the redistricting process to a three-person panel of “special masters” to draw up mapseventually approvedby a Carson City judge. In 2001, debates between Republican Gov. Kenny Guinn and the Democrat-controlled Legislatureforced a special sessionto finalize new maps.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/week-later-underdog-nevada-gop-senate-hopeful-gunters-massive-ad-buy-yet-to-materialize,True,"Update (4/11/2024 at 1 p.m.): Gunter placed $459,000 worth of advertisements on Thursday afternoon, according to AdImpact. The ads are expected to start this week and will run through the week before the Senate primary.The original story is below: Last week, Jeff Gunter announced a $3.3 million ad buy in Nevada’s U.S. Senate GOP primary in asplashy interviewwith Fox News, injecting an expensive new dynamic into a race that national Republicans want to wrap up for his primary opponent, Sam Brown. But one week later, Gunter’s campaign has still not actually placed the ad reservations, according to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filings checked mid-day Wednesday. In a Wednesday statement toThe Nevada Independent, a Gunter campaign spokesperson blamed the delay on banking issues — saying Chain Bridge Bank is “unreasonably holding a wire from being disbursed” and that the campaign planned to address the bank’s pattern of misconduct once the wire transfer is cleared. “We expect it to be released any day and the reservations to be placed imminently,” said Gunter spokesperson Erica Knight. In thead, Gunter refers to himself as “110% pro-Trump” and promises to “drain the swamp,” accompanied by photos of prominent politicians including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who has given money to Brown. Gunter, a dermatologist and former ambassador to Iceland under former President Donald Trump, is challenging front-runner Brown and 11 other candidates for the Republican nomination to take on incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV). Brown, a veteran who suffered severe burns while deployed in Afghanistan, has the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and has outpaced the rest of the GOP field in fundraising. But a multimillion-dollar ad buy would make Gunter, who has criticized Brown as insufficiently supportive of Trump, the first Republican candidate to start running their own ads on television. While Brown has yet to release his own ads, outside groups including the Koch-backedAmericans for Prosperity Actionare on the airwaves supporting him. Doing so would add a new wrinkle to the Senate primary — the only competitive one in which Trump has yet to make an endorsement — and potentially compel a response from the Brown campaign, which has thus far not engaged with primary challengers and branded the race as a two-candidate contest between himself and Rosen. But that would require Gunter to actually buy the ad time. His campaign toldThe Daily MailSunday that evidence of the bookings would be available by Wednesday, but no such transactions have been posted in the FCC’s files. This is not the Gunter campaign’s first financial mishap. In January filings with the Federal Election Commission, Gunter filed anamendmentsaying his quarterly report did not include a $200,000 loan he made to his campaign that he believed to be lost in the mail.",Error: Connection error.

The groups touted the venues — which included a Black American Community Center and a Black Voices for Trump office in North Las Vegas and a Hispanic Voices for Trump outpost in East Las Vegas — as part of a“long game” of attracting the support of minority communities that historically leaned toward Democrats. The centers were often used to host political rallies, dances and other community events, with some even helping with preparation for the U.S. citizenship test. While it’s not unusual for campaign offices to operate for just a few key months, the RNC had billed the venues as more permanent fixtures in the community that would outlast an election cycle. “This is a long-term commitment the RNC is making to communities to show that we are a party that represents every American,” then-RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said at the May 2022 opening of the Asian American Pacific Islander center in Las Vegas’ Chinatown. But aNevada Independentanalysis found that those four locations are closed and now host other businesses. The Nevada GOP did not respond to multiple requests for comment about why the centers were closed or if they plan to re-open them. The AAPI outreach center in Spring Valley is now a vape shop called“Vape Ape,”which an employee told anIndyreporter had opened in the past year. The former Hispanic Voices for Trump location in East Las Vegas is now aSpanish-speaking church, and a Black Voices for Trump outpost has been replaced by a chiropractic practice and asmall businessselling refrigerated trailers and boxes. With the exception of aNorth Las Vegas RNC center-turned-boba shop, community center locations remain listed on an active page on the Nevada GOP’swebsite, although the page is not accessible via the site’s homepage and it does not note the closure of the centers. Federal Election Commission campaign records show that the RNC spent nearly $140,000 on rent in Nevada in the 2022 election cycle; through the end of February 2024, it had made no payments for rent in the Silver State. Similarly, the Nevada Republican Central Committee spent more than $33,000 on rent in the prior campaign cycle but has only rented out lists and rooms for their February presidential caucus thus far this cycle. An RNC spokesperson toldThe Nevada Independentthat Latino engagement efforts by the committee and the Trump campaign have already begun in Nevada, but did not specify what those efforts entailed. The spokesperson added that President Joe Biden’s support among minority communities is dropping, citingrecentpollingshowing fracturing among the diverse coalition that elected him four years ago. “Without sharing our strategy with Democrats through the media, we have the message, the operation and the money to propel President Trump to victory,” Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said in a statement. The GOP’s quiet closures of these centers nationwide were first reported in January inThe Messenger, with GOP officials at the time saying they planned to reopen a Hispanic community outreach center in Las Vegas. But with McDaniel’s departure earlier this year and replacement of the RNC’s top brass with allies of former President Donald Trump,conflictingreportshave surfaced over the future of the remaining centers. The situation presents a dramatic split-screen from the Biden campaign, which, in recent weeks, has opened offices across the Las Vegas Valley as part of its effort to court minority voters in the Silver State. In March, the campaign opened offices in North Las Vegas and southeast Las Vegas, parts of the city with high Black and Asian American populations, respectively. And last week, the campaign opened an office in East Las Vegas, a heavily Latino community. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, has yet to announce any campaign office openings in Nevada. While they coordinate their campaign with the Nevada GOP, by this point in 2020, Trump campaign officials hadopened an officein Las Vegas. When Biden and Trump faced off in 2020, BidenwonHispanic voters in Nevada by a 26-percentage-point margin, Asian American voters by 29 points and Black voters by 62 points, according to exit polling.

Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) had set in 2022 with $4.4 million. In the fall, Rosenposteda $3.2 million quarter. Rosen’s haul was more than double that of Republican frontrunner Sam Brown, who raised $2.2 million in the first quarter — his best quarter thus far as well — according toFox News. Heading into April, her campaign had $13.2 million in cash on hand, a Nevada record for this point in the cycle. That war chest is getting poured into a $14 millionad reservationRosen placed Thursday to run spots on television from late July through the election. Typically, those ad buys do not need to be paid upfront.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/decades-old-idea-of-axing-federal-department-of-education-revived-in-nevada-senate-race,True,"In 2022, Sam Brown, then running as an insurgent GOP Senate primary rival against  establishment-backed Adam Laxalt, proposed eliminating the federal agency tasked with administering financial aid, collecting data about schools and monitoring educational programs and discrimination: the Department of Education. In a debate, Brown called forcuttingthe agency, among other Cabinet-level agencies, to reduce federal spending and cut into the federal deficit. At the time, Brown suggested that departments that exist at the state level, such as education or transportation, do not need a federal counterpart. Two years later, his stance has softened somewhat as the GOP front-runner in this year’s Senate race — hiscampaign websiteis now focused on empowering parents rather than bureaucrats when it comes to education. “When you allow bureaucrats to prioritize outside agendas over the development of our children, kids lose every time,” Brown said in a statement toThe Nevada Independent. “We need to get a handle on the out-of-control and ineffective budget from the U.S. Department of Education, kick D.C. bureaucrats out of our classrooms, and let kids be kids."" But Brown’s primary challengers this time around are taking up the agency abolition mantle, a proposal with potentially drastic implications on student financial aid and federal accountability of schools. Jeff Gunter, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland under former President Donald Trump, and former Nevada secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant, a vocal denier of the 2020 election results, each list eliminating the Department of Education as policy goals on their campaign websites, with Gunter referring to the agency as “useless and unneeded.” Trumpsaidlast year that he supported closing the department, but hiseffortsto rein in the agency during his presidency fell flat. But while calling to cut the department still remains a hallmark of conservative bonafides, many Senate candidates’ stances are reflective of an increasing focus among “parents’ rights” in education. Tony Grady, another candidate, points to “reestablishing parental choice” as his preferred education stance. The proposals to abolish the department are part of a GOP movement that has existed since the agency’s inception in 1980, as Republicans have questioned federal involvement in education, where policies are typically addressed at the district level. The efforts have struggled to get off the ground amid congressional opposition — especially to phasing out popular aid programs — and even a Republican president’s vast expansion of the agency’s scope in the name of greater accountability. The agency launched under President Jimmy Carter; Ronald Reagan, who was challenging Carter for the presidency that year, called for the agency’s elimination in his campaign. But three years later, alandmark reporton the American education system from a federal commission established by Reagan’s secretary of educationconcludedthat the federal government had a key role to play in education, with responsibilities such as data collection, research, curriculum development and student financial aid. In the ensuing years, there would be minimal headwinds on eliminating the department, but it remained a policy goal among key Republicans in the 1990s, including Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and presidential nominee and former Sen. Bob Dole (R-KS). The federal education system saw its largest expansion of authority under Republican President George W. Bush with the 2001 passage of theNo Child Left Behind Act, which increased the federal government’s role in holding schools accountable for student performance. “Have there been a lot of serious efforts? No,” Rick Hess, the director of education policy at the center-right think tank American Enterprise Institute, said in an interview. “Have Republicans meant this? Sure, in some cases, but they just haven't gotten very far.” Hess said legislators do not want to end some of the popular programs administred by the department, including Pell Grants, student loans and financial support for students with disabilities. “We've seen no appetite over the years for the Republican caucus in Congress to actually do that,” Hess said. That more nuanced position is reflected today by Brown, whose campaign said he still considers the department bloated and is interested in cutting programs that are redundant with state agencies, but that his approach would require reviewing programs for waste and abuse first. The Nevada Department of Education declined to comment on concerns that the federal agency has programs that are redundant with state education departments. In a statement, Brown narrowed in on another popular conservative buzzword, rather than calling for the department’s elimination — “woke.” “We need to get back to prioritizing the basics for our students — reading, writing, arithmetic, practical life skills — and not woke ideologies that have no business in the classroom,” he said. Jeffrey Henig, a political science and education professor at Columbia University, said he is not surprised that underdogs in the race are leaning into calls to end the agency, while as front-runner, Brown is being more guarded. “Sam Brown seems to be … being a little bit more mysterious about the specifics of what he'd do on education, and instead just hit on the theme of localism and keeping the federal bureaucracy out,” Henig said in an interview. “That's a strategy that makes sense if you think ‘We're the one who's gonna run [in] the general.’” Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) panned Brown as a “MAGA extremist” nonetheless who would support abolishing federal agencies, relying on his previous stance. “Eliminating the Department of Education would be a disaster for Nevada — resulting in massive cuts to our schools and dire consequences for students in kindergarten all the way through college,” Rosen said in a statement toThe Nevada Independent. Henig added that it makes strategic sense for more conservative candidates to lean into abolishing the department, because it fits into their broader political goals. “Eliminating the Department of Education, that’s my specific of how I'm going to attack the deep state, how I'm going to attack federal overregulation, how I'm going to attack Democratic overreach from Washington, D.C.,” he said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-makes-14-million-ad-reservation-in-nevada-senate-race,True,"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) placed a $14 million ad reservation for the Las Vegas and Reno media markets Thursday, a massive buy portending another expensive Senate race this cycle. Rosen’s ads will run on television from late July through the November election. The reservation likely depleted the vast majority of her cash on hand, of which she had arecord$10.6 million at the end of 2023. However, television ad reservations often do not require upfront payment. The ad buy comes on the heels of Rosenreleasingher first ads of the cycle Monday — inEnglishand inSpanish— and a rating change from the Cook Political Report, whichmovedthe Nevada Senate race from “Lean Democrat” to “Toss-Up” on Wednesday. Democrats currently hold a 51-49 advantage in the Senate and are likely to lose a seat in West Virginia after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced his retirement. That means each of the seven seats they are defending in red or swing states could swing the balance of power in the chamber — a loss by Rosen would all but guarantee a Republican takeover of the Senate. The extraordinary ad reservation set a Nevada record for a single spending announcement by a Senate candidate. In March 2022, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) made a $10 millionad reservationfor the two month run-up to the election. She went on to win by less than 1 percentage point in the closest Senate race in the country. Rosen’s $14 million spend is the clearest example yet of what her fundraising advantage can buy. None of her potential Republican challengers had more than $2 million in their campaign accountsgoing into the year; while GOP front-runner Sam Brownposteda $2.2 million first quarter, his best yet of the cycle, he has yet to launch ads. Brown still has to get through a primary with candidates including former Trump ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter, whoannounceda $3.3 million ad buy calling himself “110% pro-Trump” in an effort to take on Brown from the right. Rosen will also be buoyed by a $36 millionad reservationfrom Senate Majority PAC, the Democratic mega-spender associated with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) counterpart, Senate Leadership Fund, has not yet announced any Nevada spending plans. Nevada’s 2022 Senate contest set state records forspending, with Cortez Masto dropping $62 million and outside groups contributing another $71 million en route to her narrow victory. On the Republican side, challenger Adam Laxalt spent nearly $18 million and outside groups added more than $51 million, meaning more than $200 million was spent to reach a state of less than 2 million registered voters.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/democratic-assembly-candidate-regrets-sharing-anti-abortion-facebook-post-in-2016,True,"In 2016, Sharifa Wahab shared agraphic animated video depicting an abortionon her Facebook account that wascaptioned, “Anyone who aborts a child is undoubtedly a murderer.” The post has since been deleted, but Wahab — a caucus-backed Democrat running in Las Vegas’ Assembly District 35 — now says she believes that the decision to have an abortion should be left up to a patient and their doctor, even if she wouldn’t have one. ANevada Independentreview of her social media accounts did not turn up any other anti-abortion sentiments. “I regret sharing this Facebook post, and I can’t emphasize enough how it does not reflect my opinion on access to safe, legal abortion,” Wahab toldThe Nevada Independentin a Friday interview. “As a devout Muslim woman with a deep religious belief, I understand that abortion is not always a decision for some women, but that decision is her choice and between her and her physician.” Her comments and past social media post comes as Nevada Democrats have doubled down on support forabortion rights in hopes that the issue’s popularity will help propel Democrats to victory,with the Assembly Democratic Caucus supporting pro-abortion rights candidates and emphasizing the need to protect access to the procedure in the Silver State. Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy in Nevadabecause of a 1990 referendum, which can only be overturned by a majority vote of the people — and pro-abortion rights groups in the state are seeking to qualify another ballot question this election cycle to insert those legal protections into the state Constitution. Wahab said that the post shared more than eight years ago was a “mistake” that came about after clicking through various social media posts, and she had forgotten it existed until she was asked about it. Still, she emphasized her support of abortion access following the 2022 overturning ofRoe v. Wadeand other state-led campaigns to limit reproductive services. Though Wahab said she wouldn’t have an abortion, in part because of her faith, she wants other women to have the option to do so. Her sentiments echo state Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas), who, before a vote last session onSJR7, a resolutionseeking to enshrine abortion protections in the Nevada Constitution, revealed that shedidn’t decide to have an abortionbut believes people should have the choice to do so. Wahab owns 1st Las Vegas Home Care, which provides elderly and disabled people with home-based, nonmedical care such as grocery shopping, meal preparation, running errands and housekeeping. She will face Gov. Joe Lombardo-endorsed candidate Dr. Rebecca Edgeworth, a Republican, in the general election, as no other candidates filed to run in the race. The district is considered a swing district, with about 29 percent of voters registered as Democrats, around 27 percent registered as Republicans and more than 35 percent registered as nonpartisan. Incumbent Assemblywoman Michelle Gorelow (D-Las Vegas)announcedlast year she would not be running for re-election. “I will work every day in the state Legislature to protect Nevada women’s reproductive freedom and make sure no politician takes away a woman’s right to choose,” Wahab said.

Thead, titled “Never Have,” will air in the Las Vegas and Reno media markets beginning on Tuesday, along with new advertisements in Spanish. It’s part of her campaign’s initial seven-figure investment in TV ads, and comes about seven months before the general election. Rosen says in the ad, which includes clips of her meeting with police officers, that she “stood up to my own party” on measures to support police and enhance border security. Rosen was one of a handful of Democrats tosupporta GOP-led effort to block a police accountability package approved by Washington, D.C., city leaders. President Joe Biden latervetoedthat legislation. She was also one of 10 senators — nine of them being Democrats — tosupport an amendmenton a massive government spending bill in 2022 that would have increased border security funding, while also continuing a pandemic-era program to expel migrants at the border because of public health concerns.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-lawmakers-named-in-election-denial-report-walk-back-past-comments,True,"The two Nevada lawmakers highlighted in anew reporttracking election deniers in state legislatures have reversed themselves and now say that there was no evidence that massive voter fraud occurred in the 2020 election. The March report from theStates United Actionclaimed that state Sen. Jeff Stone (R-Henderson) and Assemblyman Ken Gray (R-Dayton) spread lies that former President Donald Trump won the 2020 election, despiteevidence to the contrary, and noted that the two could influence election-related legislation as members of their respective chambers' judiciary committees. The report from the States United Action — a nonprofit that tracks election denialism in state and federal races — identified more than 201 sitting legislators in seven swing states as “Election Deniers,” warning that they pose “a threat to current and future elections, either by their actions as legislators, by promoting disinformation and conspiracy theories, or by their demonstrated failure to respect legitimate election results.” In Nevada, the report cited a lengthy Facebook postpublished by Stoneon Nov. 19, 2020, that stated: ""Is A Peaceful Coup Blatantly Happening In The USA? YES!"" Stone added in the post that ""big tech"" and ""traditional media sources"" are ""all corrupt and may be complicit in this vast conspiracy to end the Trump Presidency at any cost."" Stone, who worked at the time for Trump as the western regional director of the U.S. Department of Labor before his election to the state Senate in 2022, said in an interview that the post came out of concern about potential fraud but was one post out of hundreds of social media updates he made around the time. He said he never received a call from the report's creators about his intention behind the post. ""I would not call myself an election denier,"" Stone toldThe Nevada Independent.""Were there instances of fraud? Yes. Was it enough to throw the election? I don't know. I don't believe that it happened based on the evidence that I've seen."" President Joe Bidendefeated Trumpin Nevada by more than 33,000 votes in the 2020 election, but Trump and many Republicans spent the post-election period promoting fantastical and unfounded claims ofmass voter fraud in Nevadaand other swing states. A move to mail-in ballot options in the 2020 election fueled many of the conspiracy theories despite fact checkers concluding fraud related to mail-in voting is “rare,” and there is “no evidence” to support the belief that mail-in voting has caused widespread voter fraud. Nevada’s former secretary of state, a Republican, said there was no “evidentiary support” that widespread voter fraud occurred in the state’s 2020 election. In 2022,The Associated Pressreportedthat Gray was among a cohort of Republicans convinced that Trump won the 2020 election. ""I do believe the election was stolen,"" Gray said at a campaign rally in 2022 when he was the chair of the rural Lyon County Board of Commissioners and a state legislative candidate. Grayeasily wonhis 2022 Assembly race and is running for re-election. The report cited the rally remarks and a 2022Facebook postfrom Gray, saying he “believes it was stolen” and that ""mistrust of the [election] system is just to [sic] pervasive."" Gray responded to the report in an interview, saying he does not ""necessarily believe that it was some widespread conspiracy … it just had left a lot of darn questions in my mind."" “I’ll tell you, I find it very, very hard to believe that Joe Biden got more votes than any presidential candidate in history, especially Barack Obama,” he toldThe Nevada Independent. “I mean, Barack Obama had people flocking to the polls, and I just don't see Biden having that power.” However, he said he still wanted to push for changes to the state’s election system because a segment of the population does not believe that the state’s elections are safe or secure. He cited the recent ""glitch"" in which a state website incorrectly showed that voters had cast a ballot in the presidential primary as another example of eroding public confidence in the election system. The error occurred after the state's recent presidential primary anddid not affect vote tabulation. ""I think we do need to make some massive changes in our system and make sure people re-engage in a system that they can trust,"" Gray said. ""People that don't trust the system, they can't be ignored.” Stone and Gray co-sponsored bills in 2023 that would have established special state law enforcement units to investigate suspected election crimes or irregularities. Both bills failed in the Democrat-controlled Legislature. ""Everybody needs to work towards building the faith in the security back [in] our election system and getting people back out to vote and encouraging people to take part in our democratic process,"" Gray said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-local-government-candidates-whos-running-in-school-board-city-county-races,True,"During Nevada’s nearly two-week candidate filing period, hundreds of down-ballot candidates filed for crucial yet often under-the-radar local offices in the state’s two most populous counties. Though down-ballot races are often overshadowed in presidential election years, the races have significant consequences for day-to-day life in Nevada communities, such as school boards setting education policy and local governments overseeing land use permits and business licensure. Many local government races are nonpartisan, which means candidates are not identified by political party and all voters, regardless of party registration, can vote in the race. In some nonpartisan races, the June 11 primary election can be even more pivotal than in partisan races, as candidates who win more than 50 percent of the vote are automatically elected to the office without having to run in the Nov. 5 general election. For more guidance on those races from the secretary of state's office,click here. Non-judicial candidates had until March 26 to withdraw from races. Among the most potentially competitive local government elections are the open Las Vegas mayoral race featuring 14 candidates, and an open Clark County Commission race featuring five candidates including Assemblywoman Shannon Bilbray-Axelrod (D-Las Vegas) and Republican April Becker, who lost to Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) in the 2022 general election. For a full list of candidates running in major races, check out the spreadsheet on ourcandidate filing live blogand our highlights of federal and legislative raceshere. Here are highlights from local government candidate filings: CLARK COUNTY Clark County Commission The partisan Clark County Commission is the most powerful county commission in the state, having control over local laws and government money allocated for the most populated area in Nevada. Three incumbents are running for re-election, while the District C seat — open after Ross Miller announced he would not seek re-election — attracted five candidates, including: Meanwhile, Democratic commissioners Marilyn Kirkpatrick, William McCurdy II and Michael Naft are defending their seats against lesser-known candidates. Clark County School Board The Clark County School Board consists of seven elected members and four appointed members who oversee a district of 300,000 students and about 40,000 employees — the state’s largest. The board hires and manages the district’s superintendent, manages district policy and approves the district’s budget. Twenty-five candidates are vying for one of the four seats on the ballot this year. Only one of the four incumbents, Board President Evelyn Garcia Morales, filed for re-election. Among the candidates are two members of the Clark County chapter of theMoms for Liberty, including Vice President Lorena Biassotti. Las Vegas City Council Fourteen candidates have filed to run in the nonpartisan race for Las Vegas mayor, the first time in more than 20 years that a member of the Goodman family is not running. Former U.S. Rep. Shelley Berkley, a Democrat who represented Nevada’s 1st Congressional District from 1999 to 2013, is looking to re-enter Nevada politics and brought in a race-leading$1.1 millionin campaign donations last year. Berkley left office after losing a 2012 bid to unseat then-Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV). She’ll likely face stiff competition from Las Vegas City Councilman Cedric Crear, who has been in office since 2018 and previously served on the state Board of Regents. He raisedmore than $420,000last year and has nearly $800,000 in cash on hand. City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman, who has represented Ward 2 since 2019 and served a term in the Assembly, is also running. She raisedmore than $750,000last year. And Kara Jenkins, the director of the Nevada Equal Rights Commission, which is responsible for addressing workplace discrimination allegations, is running for elected office for the first time. She raised$47,000last year. In addition, three nonpartisan city council seats are up for grabs, including the Ward 5 seat that Crear is vacating. Former Nevada Assemblyman Cameron “C.H.” Miller (D-Las Vegas) and Assemblywoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong (D-Las Vegas) are running for the Ward 5 seat after declining to run for re-election. Both members entered office in 2021. The incumbents in the two remaining races — Councilman Brian Knudsen for Ward 1 and Olivia Diaz for Ward 3 — each have two challengers. Knudsen’s challengers are political newcomers, while Diaz is facing the candidate she narrowly defeated in 2022 (Melissa Clary) and a former Republican candidate for state Senate (David Gomez II). Henderson City Council Three nonpartisan Henderson City Council seats are up for re-election this year, and all three incumbents are running. Challengers include Bristol Marunde, an HGTV host and retired UFC fighter, who filed to run against Ward 2 incumbent Dan Shaw. Cherlyn Arrington, who narrowly lost a bid for Nevada Senate in 2022 as a Republican, is running against Ward 4 incumbent Dan Stewart. North Las Vegas City Council Two nonpartisan seats on the North Las Vegas City Council are up for re-election this year, but only one is contested. Councilman Richard Cherchio, who has represented Ward 4 since 2015, is running unopposed. In the race for Ward 2, incumbent Ruth Anderson, who was appointed in December 2022, has two opponents: Robert Taylor, a small business owner who finished third in the city’s 2022 mayoral election, and Billy Lamont Riley, a member of the city’s planning commission who finished a distant fourth in the Ward 4 race in 2019. WASHOE COUNTY Washoe County Commission Two seats on the partisan Washoe County Commission are up in 2024. District 1 has four candidates running including: Meanwhile, District 4 Commissioner Clara Andriola — a Republicanappointedto the board last year by Gov. Joe Lombardo — is facing six opponents. Some notable candidates challenging Andriola include: Despite being of different political parties, both Hill and Andriola have faced attacks fromRobert Beadles, a prominent Republican donor and election conspiracy theorist. Washoe County School Board The Washoe County School Board consists of seven elected members and oversees a  district of about 60,000 students and more than 7,000 employees — the state’s second largest. There are 19 candidates vying for the four nonpartisan seats on the 2024 ballot, including four incumbents — Board President Beth Smith and Trustees Jeff Church, Alex Woodley and Diane Nicolet. Reno City Council Ward boundary changes have been a major factor in the nonpartisan 2024 Reno City Council election, as the city gained a new ward and the at-large position was dissolved — forcing several incumbents into new districts. Ward 1 has eight candidates (including a current member of the council) running, including: Ward 3 has five candidates including: Four candidates filed to run in the new Ward 5 including: Seven candidates filed to run in Ward 6 which candidates include Sparks City Council All three Sparks City Council incumbents up for election this cycle are running to retain their nonpartisan seats. Incumbent Paul Anderson is facing lesser known candidates in his re-election bid for Ward 3. Meanwhile, three candidates filed in the race for Ward 1: Ward 5 also has notable candidates running: BOARD OF REGENTS The Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) Board of Regents is made up of 13 nonpartisan regents who serve six-year terms. Regents set policies and approve budgets for the Silver State’s higher education institutions, including public community colleges and universities. Four spots on the board are up in 2024 — three in Clark County (Districts 1, 4 and 12) and one in Northern Nevada (District 9). District 1 is the only open seat up this cycle, after incumbent Regent Laura E. Perkins opted to run for a North Las Vegas state Senate seat. Notable candidates running in that district include: The District 4 race has five candidates, including: Three candidates are looking to represent District 9 in 2024, including: District 12 has two candidates: STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION The State Board of Education oversees all of Nevada’s 17 school districts, setting and sets policies and goals to improve student achievement, and monitoring districts’ data. Four of the board’s 11 members are elected, with the rest appointed. Because of redistricting, two incumbent board members (René Cantú and Timothy Hughes) are running in new districts, and another board member appointed last year (Angela Orr) is running for a full four-year term. Other candidates include former Clark County School Board Trustee Danielle Ford and Timothy Underwood, the senior adviser of the Clark County chapter of the Moms for Liberty, a conservative, parental rights group.

His schedule, which catalogs fundraisers from Feb. 20 through April 16, includes eight fundraisers outside of Nevada and three events in Reno. The fundraising list is littered with prominent Republicans — Sens. John Thune (R-SD) in Washington, D.C., and Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) in Oklahoma City and Tulsa; former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) in Phoenix and Atlanta, respectively; and an event hosted by two executives in Dallas. The Phoenix event was also hosted by Karrin Taylor Robson, an Arizona Republican who ran for governor in 2022 but lost the primary to Trump’s preferred candidate, Kari Lake. Brown also held two fundraisers in California in late February. The support of governors and senators underscores the national Republican apparatus’ belief in Brown’s potential to beat Rosen. Last cycle, former Attorney General Adam Laxalt lost to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) by less than 1 percentage point. His national fundraising also speaks to the difference between being an insurgent and being the Washington-backed front-runner. Brown proved to be a stronggrassroots fundraiserin 2022, a label heinvokesoftenon the campaign trail. While 44 percent of his $3 million haul through the end of 2023 were from donations of $200 or less, Brown now has better access to large-dollar donors. Rosen’s $11 million in funds raised by the end of 2023, by comparison, was composed of about 31 percent small-dollar donations.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lack-of-vp-choice-may-invalidate-rfk-jr-s-effort-to-get-on-nevada-ballot,True,"In early March, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaignannouncedit had collected enough signatures to land on Nevada’s ballot. But the signatures are likely invalid because the campaign didn’t list a running mate on its petition. UnderNevada law,independent candidates seeking a spot on the general election ballot must file a petition for candidacy that includes a vice presidential candidate — which Kennedy's campaign failed to do, according todocumentsfrom the Secretary of State’s office. Kennedyplans to announcehis vice presidential pick on Tuesday, after which his campaign can restart the signature collection process with around three months left to gather signatures. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Officesent a letterto independent candidates on March 7 — two days after Kennedy’s campaign said it had received enough signatures — that included a link to itspresidential candidate guide, which outlines the applicable Nevada laws including the requirement to list a nominee for vice president. CBS Newsfirst reported the potential for invalid signatures on Sunday. Petitions from independent presidential candidates in Nevada must receive signatures from 1 percent of voters who cast a ballot for a congressional representative in the previous election, meaning the 2024 ballot threshold is 10,095 signatures. The signature deadline isJuly 5, after which local and state elections officials undertake a signature verification process. Kennedy’s campaign on Monday provided emails that show an employee with the Nevada Secretary of State’s Officeinformed the campaign in Novemberthat the petition did not have to include a running mate’s name, and a second email that shows the officeapproved Kennedy’s petition in January. The campaignaccusedstate elections officials of conspiring with the Democratic National Committee of “outright inventing a new requirement for the petition with zero legal basis” to prevent Kennedy from landing on the ballot (the requirement to include the vice presidential nominee was added to Nevada lawin 1993). Officials with the secretary of state’s office said in an emailed statement Monday afternoon that the inaccurate guidance from an employee at the office was “an error” that will be “handled appropriately.” “In no way was the initial error or subsequent statutory guidance made with intent to benefit or harm any political party or candidate for office,” officials wrote, noting that state law is “clear” that independent presidential candidates must designate a vice-presidential nominee in his or her declaration of candidacy and that “governmental functions can’t be prevented by the conduct of statements of employees.” Kennedy’s long-shot presidential bid could draw votes from former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in Nevada by a narrow 2.4 percentage points in 2020, or about 33,500 votes. Kennedy has qualified to appear on the ballot in Utah and announced he gathered enough signatures to qualify in New Hampshire and Hawaii. However, New Hampshire and Hawaii require Kennedy to have a vice-presidential candidate before he gains ballot access. AnEmerson College/The Hillpoll from last week found Kennedy receiving 9 percent of the Nevada vote. Trump’s lead over Biden in that poll increased from 3 to 5 percentage points when third-party candidates were included. Kennedy, who is John F. Kennedy’s nephew, is the latest member of his dynastic political family to enter the American political world. He rose to prominence during the pandemic for his false anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, including that“there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective”— a comment he hassince tried to walk back— thatvaccines cause autismand that the coronavirus might have been“ethnically targeted”to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people. The World Health Organizationreportsthat vaccines “are very safe” and prevent adverse effects from harmful diseases. Kennedy originally entered the presidential race as a Democrat last year butdecidedto run as an independent in October. His other policy positions are relatively mainstream Democratic ideas, including a federal $15 minimum wage, transitioning to cleaner energy sources (Kennedy is an environmental lawyer) and police reform.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-senate-candidate-brown-refers-women-to-crisis-pregnancy-centers-on-campaign-website,True,"When Sam Brown and his wife Amysat downwith NBC News last month to discuss an abortion Amy had before meeting her husband, the Republican front-runnerurgedpoliticians to “lead with compassion” on the issue. Brown, who is running for U.S. Senate in Nevada, stated in the interview that he would not support a national abortion ban and that although he was “pro-life,” he believed in exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. On X, he encouraged women to share their stories in the hopes that that conversation, rather than scare tactics, would lead the discourse on an issue that’s become hyper-political. “Women should always feel loved [and] supported,” Brown said in the interview. “Part of that support is knowing that there are other options beyond abortion.” But in spite of acknowledging that there are circumstances in which an abortion may be appropriate, a list of “RESOURCES FOR WOMEN” appeared on Brown’scampaign websitearound the time of the interview that directs users to crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) — organizations that often oppose abortion across the board, do not refer women for the procedure and sometimes promote debunked theories that the procedure can contribute to future infertility or breast cancer. Instead, the centers offer parenting classes, referrals to adoption agencies and, sometimes, a place for pregnant women to stay and transportation to and from medical appointments. They often offer counseling, including for women who have had an abortion, and Bible studies. Their proponents argue that they serve women in need, offering medical and spiritual support and, as Brown argues for, providing information about alternatives to abortion. They argue that they help women make informed choices away from the “abortion industry” that they believe profits off of women who have unplanned pregnancies. In a statement toThe Nevada Independent, Brown’s campaign said listing information about the centers on his website fit into Brown’s policy of injecting compassion into the abortion debate and that clinics such as Planned Parenthood give a “false illusion” that abortion is the only option. ""As Sam has stated previously, women deserve to be treated with the utmost empathy and respect when they're facing an unplanned pregnancy,” said Kristy Wilkinson, Brown’s communications director. “Our Resources for Women tab exists because, to Sam and Amy, respect means providing women with as much information on their options as possible.” Critics of the centers, includingmajormedicalassociationsand lawmakers including Sen.Elizabeth Warren(D-MA), say their intentional marketing to women interested in abortion and offerings of medical services such as pregnancy tests and ultrasounds can mislead women with unplanned pregnancies, funneling them to nonmedical organizations intent on persuading women not to choose abortion. “CPCs are becoming more medicalized and presenting themselves as medical clinics when they're not regulated as such,” said Andrea Swartzendruber, a professor of public health at the University of Georgia whomappedcrisis pregnancy centers across the country. “They're not subject to personal information privacy laws. They're just not regulated as medical clinics.” Of the seven Nevada-based centers and national hotline that Brown refers women to on his website, none refer for abortions. But most have tabs on their webpages about abortion, listing side effects and sometimes promoting misinformation about long-term effects. Many caution that women who choose to terminate pregnancies are frequently coerced and have regret, anxiety and guilt. Brown, whose abortion stance haschangedsince he first ran for office in Texas in 2014, is not the only prominent Republican in Nevada to support these crisis pregnancy centers. While campaigning, Gov. Joe Lombardo (R)paidtwo of the centers Brown lists for events andhosted a town hallat an affiliated church of a third crisis pregnancy center — Las Vegas-based First Choice Pregnancy Center — that Brown also included. That center’s political beliefs also differ from Brown’s. In October 2022, First Choice Pregnancy Center posted avideoof its executive director pushing back against abortion ever being medically necessary to save a mother’s life and saying that pregnancies resulting from rape and incest are God’s will. “When you think about incest and rape, just ask yourself if it’s fair to hold somebody else accountable and to end their heartbeat for the actions of somebody else,” Deborah Costello, the executive director, said in the video. “God knew the circumstances surrounding creating that baby, and he chose to place that baby there for a reason.” Costello confirmed toThe Nevada Independentthat the center is still against exceptions for the 2024 election cycle. Swartzendruber said that sinceRoewas overturned, interest in and funding for crisis pregnancy centers hasproliferated. Supporting crisis pregnancy centers could be a way for candidates staking out a more moderate position on abortion to advocate against it without supporting a ban or new restrictions, she said. New restrictionsareunpopularin Nevada. Republican support for crisis pregnancy centers is relatively common — in several red states, they even receivepublic fundingfrom state legislatures. They’ve receivedfederal grantsas well — a practice Democrats and the Biden administration are trying to end. But Brown’s referral to crisis pregnancy centers on his campaign website is unique among both Nevada Senate candidates and swing state Republican frontrunners. Among Brown’s Senate primary rivals, neitherJim Marchant,Jeff GunterorTony Gradyhave such a list on their website — in fact, Marchant and Gunter avoid mentions of abortion issues at all. Across the swing states, Montana’sTim Sheehycalls himself pro-life and Pennsylvania’sDave McCormick, like Brown, also refers to himself as “pro-life.” while noting his opposition to a national abortion ban and support for exceptions. Arizona’sKari Lakerepeats the notion that many women regret their abortions and are “pushed” into the decision — a stance many crisis pregnancy centers take — and, like Brown, does not support a federal ban. But her website does not refer women to any crisis pregnancy centers in her state. Meanwhile, Wisconsin’sEric Hovdeand Michigan’sMike Rogersdo not mention abortion at all on their websites, though Rogerssupportedthese organizations as a member of Congress. And Ohio’s Bernie Moreno, who supports a 15-week national ban, has his website redirect to his fundraising page, avoiding policy issues entirely. And in more conservative states, includingTexas,IndianaandUtah, leading candidates do not mention any of these centers.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/aclu-some-agencies-not-complying-with-law-to-allow-voting-in-nevada-jails,True,"The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nevada is threatening to sue any local jail in the state that is not following a new Nevada law explicitly allowing inmates voting access after the organization’s review of jail policies found many are not complying with the law. Athar Haseebullah, the organization’s executive director, told state legislators on Friday that the group will begin filing lawsuits on April 15 against all jails not complying withAB286, a bill passed last year that went into effect Jan. 1 and requires all county or city jails to update their policies to allow anyone detained to register or vote in an election. The deadline was set so that any litigation could be resolved ahead of the June primary elections. Nevadans who have been convicted of a felony and remain in prison cannot vote, while those serving time in local jails for misdemeanors or who are detained awaiting a verdict have the right to vote if they are otherwise eligible. The ACLU of Nevada recently filed records requests from all applicable jails — most notably the Clark County Detention Center and Washoe County Detention Facility — and found that many of them are not following the law, said Sadmira Ramic, the organization’s voting rights attorney. The alleged violations include: Ramic also said several jail policies had inaccurate information. For example, she referred to one jail policy that stated any felon with a conviction cannot vote, which is incorrect because the Legislaturepassed a bill in 2019that restores the voting rights of convicted felons immediately upon their release from prison. Mineral County’s response to the ACLU’s records request was only that it was monitoring the new legislation, Haseebullah said. The ACLU has offered to meet with officials to walk through the legislation, but some dismissed the offer, Haseebullah added. “It just seems that there hasn't been the same level of diligence in implementation with respect to this bill as there have been with some of the other ones,” Haseebullah said at Friday’s meeting of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections, a group of state lawmakers that meets in between legislative sessions. Sen. James Ohrenschall (D-Las Vegas), the chair of the committee, said he was “very troubled” by the apparent lack of compliance. The Legislature passed AB286 in 2023 with near-unanimous support, with only three Assembly Republicans voting against the measure. It received the backing of the AFL-CIO, the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD). Nita Schmidt, a captain for the LVMPD, which oversees the Clark County Detention Center, told lawmakers on Friday that 23 people incarcerated there had voted in the state’s presidential preference primary last month. In Washoe County, 26 prisoners voted in the presidential preference primary, while one incarcerated person in Churchill County voted.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/during-nevada-swing-biden-draws-contrast-with-trump-on-health-care-national-security,True,"President Joe Biden made two stops in Nevada on Tuesday to meet with supporters and give a campaign address on high housing prices, signifying the importance of both the Silver State and cost-of-living issues in the upcoming election. Biden first stopped in Reno to rally his supporters as the campaign turns its focus from the sleepy primary to what will be a grueling general election. Then, he went to Las Vegas to talk about housing — an issue he hopes resonates particularly in Nevada, a critical swing state that has theworst affordable housing shortagein the country by several metrics. “As more folks move to Nevada for good-paying jobs, we need housing that’s affordable,” Biden said. Biden’s trip comes as part of a tour of Western swing states including Nevada and Arizona, and the campaign’s launch of an organizing programtargetingLatino voters, a key bloc in Nevada. The president iscampaigningin battleground states this month as he and Trump gear up for a rematch in November. Biden won the state in 2020 by a margin of 2.5 percentage points, but currentlytrailsTrump in state public polling by anywhere between 5 and 10 percentage points. Though it is the smallest battleground state, both presidential campaigns consider Nevada a key part of their 2024 goals. Tuesday’s visit marks Biden’sthird trip to Nevadain the past three months, while Trump this year made apair of appearancesin Las Vegas before his easy victory in the state’s February presidential caucus. Housing speech Speaking to a majority union crowd of around 200 people at a community center near downtown Las Vegas, Biden outlined his administration’s efforts to lower housing costs across the country and in Nevada, where people mustmake around $28 hourlyto be able to afford a standard two-bedroom apartment. Biden, who was preceded by Nevada’s three Democratic House members, made clear that he believes the best long-term solution to the affordable housing crisis is to “build, build, build.” Henotedthat single-family home construction starts and allocated permits are at their highest levels in about two years and called for the expansion and creation of tax credits to spur affordable housing development and renovation. But he also advocated for a series of both supply and demand-side interventions for homeowners and renters that he called for in his administration’s budget request for next year. Left unsaid was how unlikely it is that the Republican-run House of Representatives would take him up on his proposals and the fact that the bulk of the next fiscal year will take place after the election — meaning Biden’s housing agenda would require a second term and a friendlier Congress. For homeowners, Biden is proposing a pair of $10,000 tax credits for middle-class buyers who are either buying their first home or selling a starter home. The credits would last for two years as an attempt to promote homeownership despite high mortgage rates. Mortgage rates more thandoubledbetween 2021 and 2023, a result of the Federal Reserve’s continual interest rate hikes aimed at slowing inflation. “For homeowners, inflation keeps coming down,” Biden said. “Mortgage rates are going to come down as well. But I'm not going to wait.” He also spoke to the racial wealth gap in home valuations and called on Realtors to follow through on the National Association of Realtors’recent settlement agreementthat buyers can negotiate commissions lower than the traditional 6 percent of the sale price. On the renter side, the president discussed using existing antitrust authority — meaning he would not need Congress — to go after corporate landlords and private equity companies for price fixing in the housing market. “Landlords should be competing to give folks the best deal, not conspiring to charge them more,” he said. He also called on Congress to expand the existing housing voucher program that provides rental assistance, including guaranteeing vouchers for youth aging out of foster care and low-income veterans. Biden’s visit came the same day that Republican Gov. Joe Lombardoreleased a letterurging Biden to release more federal land to build more housing. The president didn’t address the governor’s letter or whether release of more public lands are the right solution to Nevada’s housing shortage, but he did praise Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) as a “driving force to cut red tape and build more affordable housing all across Nevada,” a reference to herlegislationto eliminate a bureaucratic barrier for land appraisers to work across state lines on public land transactions. Daniel Corona, the Northern Nevada deputy political and coalitions director for the Biden campaign, said in Reno that federal investment in infrastructure could help lower housing costs in Nevada, but was skeptical of using federal lands as a solution. “I don't know necessarily that the fix in Nevada is more houses on federal land,” Corona said. “We have tons of sprawl in the state of Nevada. There's a way to do it smarter; I don't know if the governor's ask of federal land is the smartest way to do so.” Frank Gallardo, who attended Biden’s Las Vegas event, works for Chicanos Por La Causa, a Nevada community organization whose work includes providing housing assistance. He also was skeptical of Lombardo’s letter and ask for release of more public lands. “Is it simply going to be more apartment complexes that unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be rent restrictions in place, that allow landlords to keep up the rents?” Gallardo said. Housing stories Biden framed his proposals for lowering costs of homeownership as borne out of his own middle-class childhood. Biden’s family left Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1953 as the economy crumbled and moved to Delaware, where they lived in a duplex that later became public housing. “We weren't poor, but we never had anything at the end of the month,” Biden said. It was an all-too-familiar story for some of the attendees at Biden’s Las Vegas event. Maria Bajarano, 50, and Victor Cureño, 52, immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico in the 1990s. Since then, the couple had to rent apartments because of high housing costs, which also prevented them from spending money on other needs, such as replacing a damaged car. But last month, the couple bought their first home thanks to aNevada programthat provides $15,000 in down payment assistance. Bajarano called owning a house “a dream come true.” “Now that we get the house, we have money to pay for a car or to go to Mexico,” she said. Paul Vargas, 62, lived in California for 48 years before moving to Nevada a couple of years ago because of the housing costs. He called the move “traumatic.” “My family’s there, my mother, my sisters, my kids,” Vargas said. Even after moving to Nevada, Vargas said he had to scale down what kind of house they wanted because of costs. “We didn’t know it would be this expensive,” he said. Rallying supporters in Reno Before his housing-focused visit to Las Vegas, Biden kicked off his Tuesday swing through Nevada with a visit to Democratic Party headquarters in Washoe County, the state’s second-largest county and one expected to be crucial once again to victory this cycle. Speaking to a room of about 50 Northern Nevada leaders and volunteers, including Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno) and Reno Councilman Devon Reese, Biden took aim at Trump, saying he would undo the progress on job creation, national security and drug pricing seen over the last four years and urging voters to take Trump’s incendiary comments at face value. “I’ve never heard a president say the things that this guy has said,” Biden said, referring toreportsthat the former president privatelymalignedveterans. “But the difference is, he means it.” Against a backdrop of checkerboarded blue and white Biden-Harris campaign signs in Reno, Biden focused on Trump — explicitly criticizing the former president’s promise togive large tax breaks for rich donorsand increasing costs for health care, while saying Democratshad and will fightto keep prescription drug costs down. Biden also criticized Trump’s comments that he would remain committed to NATO if the European countries paid their “fair share” to defense costs. “He said if a NATO member or European country doesn't pay their dues,come in, do whatever the hell you want,” Biden said. “He has no basis on understanding what American foreign policy is about, what national security is about.” Corona, the former mayor of West Wendover, said that the Biden campaign plans to invest in a rural political director and invest in more organizers to be on the ground in remote areas of the Silver State. Traditionally, Democrats’ strategy in statewide campaigns is to gain victory by large margins in Clark and relying on Reno to secure Washoe — a swingy county in a swingy state — while keeping losses in rural areas manageable. “This isn’t just a campaign about Washoe and Clark County,” he said. “This is a campaign about all of Nevada and we're not going to leave any stone left unturned in those communities.” Updated on 3/19/24 at 4:54 p.m. to include information from Biden's event in Las Vegas.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/secretary-of-state-delays-rollout-of-top-down-voter-registration-system-to-july,True,"The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office is pushing back its rollout of a long-anticipated, centralized voter registration and election system from April to July amid concerns raised by more than a dozen county clerks who were uncertain that the system could be fully vetted ahead of the June primary. The decision on the project — which seeks to unify a fragmented system that relies on 17 individual counties maintaining unique records, and then reporting them to the state — follows arequestfrom the Nevada Association of County Clerks and Election Officials on Monday to delay the project's implementation. The counties’ top election officials wrote that the project’s “narrow window” of time allocated to review, fix and check updates resulting from a test run is too short given the existing demands on their offices and the imminent June primary elections. “This request is not made lightly. We need this system. More importantly, we need this system to be successful,” officials wrote. “We all are charged with ensuring the accuracy, integrity, and security of elections. We must be able to guarantee that we have a final product that will best serve the needs of the voters in Nevada.” Two counties did not sign onto the letter: Clark County, which already uses the new software, and Lyon County, whichsubmitted a separate requestto delay the project’s launch date. In aresponse letter on Monday, Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said that project development will continue based on the existing timeline with the hopes of resolving any issues ahead of a July go-live date. This means the system will not be live for the state primary elections in June as originally intended, but should be operational for the November general election. “The confidence of the voters, our constituents, must be our top priority, and I understand that you made this request with them in mind,” Aguilar wrote in a response letter to the county clerks on Monday. “I am grateful that you recognize the importance of moving to a top-down system and are looking forward to going live before the 2024 presidential election.” In Nevada, individual counties maintain their own voter registration databases and transmit that data to state officials every night. A2017 report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commissionidentified Nevada as one of six states with a bottom-up voter registration system. Under the new system, voter registration data would be uploaded to a statewide database in real time — generally considered to be more effective in maintaining voter rolls andeasing logistical hurdlesassociated with things like same-day voter registration. State elections officials have touted the new system as a way to allow for comprehensive maintenance of voter history, reduce time needed to validate voter registration applications, have standardized training among election officials and allow for more election transparency. The delay comes one month after AguilartoldThe Nevada Independentthat the new system was still set for an April 1 launch date,addingthat the new system would have prevented last month’s voter history glitch, which erroneously showed that some Nevadans had participated in the presidential preference primary when they hadn’t. The mishap did not affect the results of the presidential primary, which took place before the glitch occurred. The April 1 rollout date was only for the first phase of the project and applied to all counties except Clark County. The county already used the new system for the presidential primary but will not be immediately included in the initial rollout. The entire project was expected to be fully operational by the summer of 2025. The highly anticipated system overhaul has been in the works for years. In 2021, the Legislature passedAB422, which called for creating the new system and established a January 2024 deadline. A year later, a top state elections official asked lawmakers for an extension until 2026 and said that elections officials wanted to build the new system “properly, not quickly.” Last year, the Legislatureapproved $30.5 million, including $25 million in state dollars, to support one-time costs for the project. The projecthad previously been fundedthrough federal Help America Vote Act grant dollars. In their Monday letter, the county elections officials said they “eagerly anticipate” the benefits of the new system, but acknowledged that they have struggled to meet the workload demanded by the project on top of their existing responsibilities. “Our combined resources are stretched too thin to do the required election activities along with demands from our other offices while simultaneously testing the system upgrades and integrations, and conducting additional mock election exercises required to confirm data conversion,” the letter read.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/why-is-an-elected-official-in-california-running-for-nevadas-senate-seat,True,"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) only drew two Democratic primary challengers in her bid for re-election, but one of them, Mike Schaefer, has the distinction of currently holding elected office. In California. Schaefer has served on the California Board of Equalization since 2019, representing a Southern California district on the state’s tax administration agency from his home in San Diego. But his California residency isn’t stopping the 84-year-old perennial candidate from challenging Rosen on a platform that includes wanting to bring Disney investment to Las Vegas, amend the way tips for gaming employees are taxed and try to attract a World’s Fair to Las Vegas. Can a candidate run for office in a state that is not their primary residence? A California appeals court ruled in 2000 that federal candidates do not have to be a resident of the district in which they’re seeking office until elected, based on a casebrought bySchaefer himself when he was a Nevada resident seeking to run in California. In an interview, Schaefer said he moved back to California from Nevada in 2016, but that he maintains two condos in Las Vegas and reads theLas Vegas Review-Journalevery morning. On the off chance that he wins, he said he would resign his California office and change his residence. “I feel I'm a good candidate, whether I live on the moon or in Las Vegas,” Schaefer said in an interview. “What's most important is I’ll live in Washington, D.C. and be stirring things up during the six years.” In 2018, Rosen won 77 percent of Democrats in the Senate primary as a one-term House member. She’s going into the 2024 race with over $10 million in the bank, an incumbency advantage and theendorsementofmajororganizationsin Democratic politics. Schaefer, by comparison, has not reported any funds raised andwon2.5 percent of the vote in the last Nevada primary he ran in, for the Fourth Congressional District in 2016. Schaefer served on the San Diego City Council in the 1960s and then ran for nearly three dozen offices in multiple states before being elected in California again in 2018. The octogenarian has beenlegally sanctionedfor being a slumlord and was convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse, but he surprisingly advanced through a primary for the Board of Equalization and found himself in a general election against a Republican who told a female lobbyist he should “bitch slap” her at the height of the #MeToo movement, Schaeferwonthe race, and won re-election in 2022 with theendorsementof the state Democratic Party. This Senate run isn’t Schaefer’s first time running in Nevada. He unsuccessfully ran to be secretary of state in 1974, as a Republican, and for controller in 2014 as a Democrat; but wasremoved from the ballotin that race after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled he did not meet residency requirements for state office. In Nevada alone, he’salso rununsuccessfully for the House of Representatives, Clark County public administrator and state Senate. In acampaign websitewith appeals to voters in both his California Board of Equalization district and Nevada Democrats, Schaefer presents himself as better-educated, more successful in business and more likely to be respected in Washington because of his age. The soon-to-be 86-year-old notes that “all our leaders are seniors in Washington”, which ostensibly would give him an advantage over the 66-year-old Rosen. (Rosen, for what it’s worth, is ofmedian agein the Senate.) Schaefer also refers to Rosen on his website as a “boring” senator who is the “least prominent” member of the upper chamber. He said with the exception of the late Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Nevada has had low-profile senators — a trend he wants to buck. Having lost scores of races, Schaefer isn’t naive about his longshot electoral prospects. In fact, he had a bold prediction for the race: Rosen will beat Republican frontrunner Sam Brown. He’s so sure that he believes the GOP’s best chance of winning the seat would be to boost a weaker Democratic candidate — like himself. “I'm the darling of the Republican Party, if they're only smart enough to realize it,” he said. “Their candidate Sam doesn't have a chance unless they get somebody who's vulnerable, like me!” After finally achieving elected office after decades of trying, why does Schaefer want to run again? He said it also owes to his age. “I'm not here forever,” Schaefer said. “I'm just trying to stir up enough pots and rattle enough cages, so that I won't leave this earth feeling there's some stone I left unturned.”",Error: Connection error.

In a presidential election year that historically drives more voters to the ballot box, Nevada has the spotlight as the swing state weighs in on the anticipated competitive presidential and U.S. Senate elections as well as the 52 legislative races that will determine Gov. Joe Lombardo’s veto power in the 2025 legislative session. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and Nevada’s three Democratic House representatives are facing a bevy of Republican challengers looking to take advantage of President Joe Biden’spoor approval ratingsand the high cost of living, while Democrats campaign on the Inflation Reduction Act, a robust job market and progress on other social and economic issues. Notably, no Democrats filed to run against Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV). Though federal elections often receive the most attention, Nevada’s legislative elections are at the forefront of the 2024 election cycle as Lombardo seeks to protect his veto power by preventing Democratic supermajorities. Democrats already hold a 28-seat supermajority in the 42-member Assembly and are just one short of the 14 seats needed for a supermajority in the 21-member Senate. Excluding races not up in 2024 and those where only candidates of one political party filed, 43 legislative seats are still in play.

Four well-known contenders top the expansive Republican field: Other Republican candidates include Bill Conrad, a military veteran and founder and president of the National Association of Podcasters; perennial candidate Edward Hamilton; attorney Ronda Kennedy; asset manager Barry Cameron Lindemann; real estate broker Stephanie Phillips; engineering consultant Vincent Geronimo Rego, former Assemblyman Garn Mabey (R-Las Vegas); Gary A. Marinch, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2014; and Shawn White. Rosen is running against two candidates in the Democratic primary — Troy Zakari Walker and Mike Schaefer. Schaeferlives in California and holds an elected position on a California tax board, but he’s based his campaign on a California appeals court ruling in 2000 that federal candidates do not have to be a resident of the district in which they’re seeking office until elected. Schaeferbrought the casewhen he was a Nevada resident seeking to run in California. Congressional District 1 The historically deep-blue district is now more competitive following the 2021 redistricting process, when the Democrat-controlled Legislature added more Republican voters byredrawing the districtto include more of Henderson and Boulder City as part of a strategy to make the state’s two other swingy House districts more favorable to Democrats. Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) has held the seat since 2013 and is not facing a primary challenger this election cycle. Five Republicans and six minor party candidates filed to run for the seat. Republicans running in District 1 include financial planner and retired Army Col. Mark Robertson, who lost to Titus in the 2022 general election. Other candidates include stand-up comedian Michael Boris; restaurant chain owner and operator Fleming Larsen; Jim Blockey, who ran for Congress in 1998 and 2000; and Evan Stone. Congressional District 2 In Northern Nevada’s Congressional District 2, Amodei will face a primary challenge from Fred Simon, a Minden-based doctor who ran for governor in 2022. He’ll also face three other long-shot independent or third-party candidates in the general election, includingGreg Kidd, a founding partner of Hard Yaka, an investment firm focused on portable identity, payments and marketplaces. Through Hard Yaka, Kidd was an adviser and early investor for a number of different companies, including the cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase, the stock trading app Robinhood and the social media platform Twitter. Stock market research companyGuruFocusestimates Kidd’s net worth is at least $40 million. No Democrats filed to run for the seat, a historical rarity. Over the last 40 years, 1998 marked the only other election when no Democratic candidate ran for the seat; then-Rep. Jim Gibbons (R-NV) won re-election that year. Congressional District 3 Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) faces just one primary challenger in her bid for a fourth consecutive term: RockAthena Brittain. The district, which is typically the most competitive in Nevada, became more favorable to Democrats after the 2021 redistricting process. Seven GOP challengers are vying for a chance to unseat her, including former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien (R-Las Vegas), tax analyst Drew Johnson, former state Treasurer Dan Schwartz, video game music composer Martin O’Donnell, entrepreneur and poker player Brian Nadell, attorney Steve Schiffman and Steven London. In 2022, Johnson made an unsuccessful bid for Clark County Commission District F, losing in the general election to Democratic incumbent Justin Jones by less than a percentage point. Schwartz, who served as state treasurer from 2015 to 2019, has run in nearly every election cycle in Nevada since 2012, losing multiple congressional bids. He previously ran in the Republican primary for the 3rd District in 2020, finishing second to Dan Rodimer. One independent candidate, Jon Kamerath, has also filed to run in the election. Congressional District 4 In wide-reaching District 4, which covers parts of rural Nevada and North Las Vegas, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) faces one primary opponent: Deshan Levy Shultz. John Lee, a former mayor of North Las Vegas who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2022 after switching his party registration from Democrat to Republican, is one of three Republicans to file for the seat. He’ll face Air Force veteran and businessman David Flippo and entrepreneur and accountant Bruce Frazey in the Republican primary. Two other minor party candidates — mortgage company owner Russell Best, a member of the Independent American Party, and Timothy John Ferreira, a Libertarian — also filed to run in the election. LEGISLATURE Filings show six legislators (four Republicans and two Democrats) did not garner any challengers, virtually guaranteeing their re-election and return to the 2025 legislative session. Three of the legislative seats up for election this cycle (two Senate seats and one Assembly seat) only drew candidates from one party. Forty-three seats are still in play, with candidates from different parties vying for success in the general election as Republicans attempt to stave off a veto-proof Democratic supermajority in both houses. The remaining seats are not up for election in 2024. Democrats are expected to maintain legislative majorities afterbuilding in structural advantagesin voter registration through the 2021 redistricting process. However, Democrats may face roadblocks as they attempt to gain a supermajority in both houses that would allow the party to override Lombardo’s veto authority. The six legislative races with an incumbent running for re-election that failed to draw challengers are: Three of the legislative seats up for election this cycle will be decided in the primary: STATEWIDE RACES Supreme CourtNevada Supreme Court Justices Elissa Cadish, Patricia Lee and Lidia Stiglich did not draw opponents in their runs for state Supreme Court, meaning the three will be automatically elected to a six-year term on the state’s highest court.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/ahead-of-bidens-nevada-visit-campaign-previews-2024-strategy,True,"Nevada may be the smallest of the six battleground states likely to decide the 2024 presidential election, but it remains critical to President Joe Biden’s path to 270 electoral votes — a key reason he’s set to visit both Reno and Las Vegas Tuesday. Public polling  in Nevada has consistently found former president Donald Trump withleadsof between 5 and 10 percentage points over Biden — meaning the president’s campaign has to work to rebuild the coalition that won the state for  him in 2020 by about 2.5 percentage points. Atthis pointin 2020, Biden held a 6-point lead over Trump in aggregated Nevada polling. To that end, Biden will engage with volunteers during his trip to crucial Washoe County, a traditional bellwether he won by 4.5 percentage points in 2020, and his aides are targeting a set of issues and voter groups they believe can improve Biden’s margins. The Biden campaign has nearly two dozen full-time staffers in Nevada, and are announcing several new hires in advance of the president’s visit, including deputy political and coalitions director Daniel Corona, a former mayor of Elko County’s West Wendover, who will help engage voters outside of Las Vegas and Reno. To gain Nevadans’ support, the Biden campaign said in a Monday memo they are focusing on issues that they believe matter most to Western voters, including standing with unions, job creation, pushing against election denialism, securing the southern border and supporting abortion access. Despite weak poll numbers, Biden’s campaign strategists are optimistic and categorize Nevada as aunion-dense state— union members account for 12.4 percent of wage and salary workers in the Silver State — that is overwhelminglyin support of abortion access— 69 percent of Nevadans described themselves as pro-choice in an October 2021poll by OH Predictive Insights. In addition, Biden is likely to tout Nevada’shigh rate of job creationin his visit — a metric in which the Silver State ranked first among all states in 2023 (despiteretaining the nation’s highest unemployment rate). In both Arizona and Nevada, states Biden will visit this week, the campaign also plans to highlight how election denialism has become a dominant issue among Republicans since 2020. “The state Republican Party in Nevada isrunby Trump’s indicted fake electors,” Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez noted in a memo about the campaign's strategy in the Southwest. “Democrats, independents, and moderate Republicans have come together to defeat the far-right candidates in these states who have parroted Trump’s lies.” As an example, Rodriguez noted Republican former Attorney General Adam Laxalt’s failed challenge against Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) in 2022 after walking a “rigged election tightrope” in his role with the Trump campaign casting suspicion on the state’s election results in 2020. On immigration, an issue that hassurgedto be voters’ top issue — surpassing even the economy — for the first time since 2019, according to Gallup, Trump has consistentlypolledbetterthan Biden as encounters at the southern border have spiked. Biden campaign aides said they plan to keep drawing contrasts between the president’s attempt to pass aborder security bill, blocked by Republicans, and Trump’s past policies and dehumanizing rhetoric. Trump has made immigration a cornerstone of his rallies thus far, includingsayingover the weekend that some migrants accused of crimes are “not people.” Chavez Rodriguez also noted that Democrats are better-financed and have broader infrastructure in place than their GOP counterparts. In Nevada, for example, the Democratic coordinated campaign is opening separate offices in north, east and southwest Las Vegas, in order to target Black, Latino and Asian American voters, respectively. The campaign is already up ontelevisionwith ad buys, including inSpanish. “Every national paid media campaign to date has included Arizona and Nevada, because they are core battleground states, and Spanish-language television,” Chavez Rodriguez wrote. Amidst abevyofstoriessuggesting voters of color might be moving towards Trump, Biden campaign aides were eager to draw that infrastructural distinction and point out that the Republican National Committee, facing financial woes, hasclosedseveral community centers first opened in 2022 and focused on outreach to minority groups across the country. While Nevada has a number of demographic characteristics that have benefited Democrats in the past — including a highly unionized workforce and a large Latino population, which Biden won by about25 pointsin 2020, registered nonpartisans have become the largest voter group, making winning independents key. And Republicans stand to gain from Nevada’s high percentage of non-college educated voters, which is similar to that of traditionally red states such as Alabama and Oklahoma. Traditionally, the path to Democratic victory has been winning by large margins in Clark County, relying on voters in Reno to win swingy Washoe County and trying to keep their losses in rural Nevada manageable. Biden’s trip to Reno — where the administration has madesignificant investmentsin the region’s lithium and manufacturing industries — reflects the importance the campaign is putting on Washoe, particularly as Clark becomes less of a Democratic stronghold. Washoe County proved a difference maker in 2022, when Cortez Masto won the county by 4 percentage points while then-Gov. Steve Sisolak only won it by about 1.5 percentage points; Cortez Masto held her seat, while Sisolak ultimately lost.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-will-democrats-tough-2024-senate-map-affect-jacky-rosen,True,"In the fall of 2022, all eyes were on Nevada. As Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and her allies crisscrossed the state, she was flanked byreportersfrom nationaloutletsnarrowed in on the race they were convinced would decide the Senate. TheNew York Timescalled her“the most politically endangered Democrat incumbent.”FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver said Nevada could be Senate Republicans’ “ace in the hole” andrankedit as their best pickup opportunity. National Democratic groups responded accordingly. Through Election Day, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)spent$10 million in Nevada, the most it spent in any state. Senate Majority PAC, the Democratic super PAC spending machine aligned with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), dropped more than $29 million in Nevada, an amount second only to its spending in Pennsylvania. The investment was well-placed. Cortez Masto won by less than a point in what proved to be the closest Senate race in the country. Outside spending in Nevada’s Senate race nearly eclipsed $123 million, thethird-highest spending totalnationwide that election cycle in a state with a much smaller population than the two other marquee political battlegrounds. The 2024 cycle, by contrast, will require Senate Democrats to defend seven competitive seats, including in states where they have become endangered species. Given the larger map, will Nevada still matter? The 2024 map Republicans have not won a federal statewide election in Nevada since 2012, but Cortez Masto’s nailbiter victory and the state’s distinction as the only blue-to-red gubernatorial flip last cycle have proved that the Silver State is still solidly purple. But Cortez Masto was running in a year where Democrats were on the offense, with few swing state incumbents to defend and multiple pickup opportunities in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin. In 2024, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) is running for her second term in a presidential cycle where Democrats are playing defense — a map on which Rosen is fighting for resources and attention from far more colleagues than Cortez Masto faced two years ago. Strategists and donors’ eyes are on Nevada this year. But they will also be on Montana and Ohio, where Democratic incumbents are fighting for their political lives in red states. Four other presidential battlegrounds also have high profile Senate races in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Plus, national Democrats are going on offense in Texas and Florida, convinced that uniquely unpopular Republican incumbents in each state make for potential pickups. And even some ostensibly safe Democratic seats will now require national investment. Popular former governor Larry Hogan (R) is running for an open seat in Maryland, meaning Democrat-aligned groups will have to direct more money to the Old Line State. And their standing in New Jersey is somewhat muddled by the negative attention Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), who has still not said whether he will run again, has garnered after being federally indicted on corruption charges. Early budgetary signs show that Nevada is as critical to Democrats’ plans as any other swing state. Senate Majority PAC’s (SMP) first ad reservation announcementin late Januaryincluded just Montana and Nevada. The well-funded group is spending $36 million in the state. Democratic strategists categorize Senate races into red states, presidential swing states and pickups, placing Nevada in a swing state group with Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Among its peers, Nevada — despite only having two media markets — is receiving the second-most amount of money; SMP is sending $42 million to Pennsylvania to defend Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), $23 million to Arizona, and $14 million apiece to Michigan and Wisconsin. So far,tracked outside spendingin Nevada’s 2024 Senate race is at just $1.7 million, with almost all of the money going to support veteran Sam Brown, Rosen’s most likely general election opponent. Rosen herself ended 2023 withmore than $10.6 millionin the bank, the highest total of any Senate Democratic candidate in a presidential swing state. Cortez Masto, herself a prodigious fundraiser, made a record-breaking$10 million ad reservationin March of 2022. David Damore, a political scientist at UNLV, said Democrats’ expansive map might affect Rosen “at the margins,” but that he expects Nevada, with competitive races up and down the ballot, and Democrats’ ability to reach the vast majority of the state’s likely Democratic voters in just two media markets, will remain a highly attractive investment for outside spending. “There's not a dearth of money out there,” he said. “Particularly the outside money, and the latitude those groups have to raise and spend it.” The Republican equivalents of those groups — the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and Senate Leadership Fund — have yet to announce ad reservations. A national GOP strategist familiar with the race, granted anonymity to speak freely, said Nevada is one of their top priorities this cycle, given that they believe the state is trending Republican, the party has a preferred candidate who has shown fundraising prowess and that Rosen, unlike some other senators they’re trying to defeat this cycle, has relatively low name recognition in their polling. Polling has been relatively sparse at this point in the cycle, but those that have been conductedfindRosen slightly leading Brown. Near this point in the cycle in 2022, polling on the race between Cortez Masto and opponent Adam Laxalt washighly variable, ranging from finding Cortez Masto with an 8-point lead to Laxalt holding a 3-point advantage. With retiring Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV)’s seat sure to flip to Republican control, Democrats need to defend every other seat they currently hold in order to have a 50-50 Senate. They have no margin for error — every race is critical. While still early in the cycle, the DSCC has included Nevada in its two major commitments thus far — funding on-the-ground staff focused on “Republican accountability” andopeninga command center office in the state. Nevada is one of just five states that received that support. All in on Rosen National Democratic strategists said they have no doubt that Nevada will be a “highly competitive” race and plan to spend in the state with that reality in mind. At this point in the cycle, the Rosen campaign believes national Democratic groups’ actions reflect their belief in Nevada’s status as a top tier race. A Democratic strategist who is familiar with the campaign and was granted anonymity to speak freely said they expect Rosen to receive similar outside resources to Cortez Masto, and that in conversations among Democrats, Cortez Masto’s slim margin comes up frequently. Democrats’ wide-reaching map is reflected in the makeup of Rosen’s donors, many of whomalso giveto Sens. Jon Tester (D-MT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Casey — demonstrating that big-money Democrats consider Rosen’s race to be of similar importance to those of her peers. DSCC chair Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) said he believes Rosen will win on the strength of her record and campaign organization. But he added that Democrats’ campaign arm is not taking chances with any of its incumbents. “I'm always of the school of thought that you take every race very seriously and you work really hard,” he said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-why-theres-two-abortion-ballot-initiatives-in-nevada,True,"The Nevada Supreme Court heard arguments last week about whether a question to enshrine abortion rights in the state Constitution can be placed on the November ballot. But even if the court rules against that effort, a similar question may still appear on Nevada’s ballot. Why? The Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom PAC, which was founded last year and is connected to Planned Parenthood’s political advocacy arm, has simultaneously filed two separate abortion-related ballot efforts that have different scopes and legal statuses. The first, which attorneys debated before the Supreme Court last week,began last Septemberand is in legal jeopardy after a district court judgeruled in Novemberthat the proposed constitutional amendment — which would have also covered procedures or coverage like vasectomies, infertility care and prenatal care — was too broad, violating the state’s single-subject rule for ballot initiatives. Soon after that ruling, Nevadans for Reproductive Freedomlaunched a second effortwith a much narrower scope. The same judge who struck down the group’s first effort cleared the second petition in January after a legal challenge, but that ruling is also being appealed in the state Supreme Court. Legal scrutiny is only the first hurdle. To get the measure on the ballot, petition supporters must obtain at least 102,362 signatures by June 26, with a minimum number of 25,591 signatures coming from each of the state’s four congressional districts. If a measure lands on the ballot and is passed by voters, it would be placed on the ballot again in 2026; a second affirmative vote at that election would add the language to the state Constitution. As of Monday, the group said that the second, narrower petition already had more than 45,000 signatures. The organization did not answer questions about which ballot initiative it would choose to pursue if the first petition prevails in court or give details about the breakdown of support by congressional district. The ballot initiatives are part of a concerted effort by Nevada Democrats to makeabortion rights a resonant political issue this year. Democratsbenefited politicallyafter the June 2022overturningofRoe v. Wade, and the party is now hoping to continue capitalizing on that enthusiasm — apolllast year indicated that more than 60 percent of Nevadans across all parties support adding abortion rights to the Constitution. Abortion is already legal up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy in Nevadabecause of a 1990 referendum, which can only be overturned by a majority vote of the people. Here’s a closer look at both ballot initiatives. ‘Reproductive freedom’ petition Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom’s first petition sought to establish a constitutional right to reproductive freedom, which as written would cover prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomies, tubal ligations, abortion care and care for miscarriages. The measure would also prohibit the state from penalizing any individual based on the outcome of their pregnancy, or any health care provider or another individual from assisting a person with an abortion. In October, a new PAC called the Coalition for Parents and Childrensued to blockthe effort. The lawsuit said the petition violated the state Constitution’s single-subject rule by including a wide swath of medical procedures. The lawsuit also said the question’s enforcement provisions would implicitly require money “to fund a board to review whether abortions or reproductive services were performed pursuant to standard of care.” Carson City District Court Judge James Russell in Novemberruledthat the ballot question was constitutionally invalid, saying it was “probably the clearest case I have seen that I think there is a violation of the single subject rule.” Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court. In last week’s oral arguments on the appeal before the high court, several justices appeared skeptical of the district court’s ruling. Justice Douglas Herndon said that the medical procedures covered by the petition are related to each other and reproductive care more broadly. “If my wife repeatedly has miscarriages in pregnancies, and it's very difficult for her, and I choose to get a vasectomy, so that we don't have to go through that and maybe we want to adopt, those things are very much related,” Herndon said. “Prenatal care, as I said earlier, is related to what happens in a pregnancy and potentially a miscarriage, postpartum care is related to what happens in childbirth.” Jason Guinasso, the lawyer representing the Coalition for Parents and Children, acknowledged in an interview that the judges were skeptical of his arguments. He said a decision will likely come in April. Abortion rights petition Amid the legal uncertainty surrounding their first petition, Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom launched a much narrower second petition in December. Therevised petitionwould protect the right to an abortion until fetal viability, generally considered about 23 or 24 weeks, or when necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient. These are essentially the same protections that already exist under Nevada law, but a constitutional right to an abortion would be harder to overturn. In February, Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom held an event to officially kick off the ballot initiative that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat and potential future presidential hopeful, attended. His nonprofit has poured $1 million into the effort andhas also helped hire aides. The Coalition for Parents and Children also challenged this petition by arguing its “description of effect” — a 200-word summary included on signature gathering forms — was misleading by not acknowledging that abortion is already legal under Nevada law. It also said the petition would create an unfunded mandate. Russell, who also presided over this case,ruled against this challenge. He wrote that the “description of effect” was “legally adequate” and that there was no evidence the petition would result in an unfunded mandate. Guinasso, who is again representing the Coalition for Parents and Children, filed an appeal to the state Supreme Court last month. In an interview, he said a hearing on the appeal would likely take place in May or June. Legislative efforts to enshrine abortion protections in the Nevada Constitution Both initiatives came after a group of 40 Democratic legislators, led by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas),introduced and passeda measure during the 2023 legislative session to enshrine abortion protections in the Nevada Constitution. The constitutional amendment must return to the Legislature and pass again in 2025 before it could go before voters during the 2026 general election. “Now that a radical Supreme Court has gutted the right to choose at the federal level, Nevadans should be given the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to protect reproductive freedoms in the state constitution,” Cannizzarosaid in a statementfollowing the Senate’s party-line vote to pass the constitutional amendment in April. The proposed constitutional amendment,SJR7, echoes the first petition and would guarantee “a fundamental right to reproductive freedom,” authorize the state “to regulate abortion care after fetal viability with certain exceptions” and prevent the state from penalizing or prosecuting an individual exercising their “reproductive freedom.” Though the governor has veto power over measures passed out of the Legislature, the proposed amendment could not be vetoed by the governor.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/culinary-targets-democratic-state-senator-for-not-supporting-daily-hotel-room-cleaning-law,True,"Nevada Sen. Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas) is being targeted by the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which announced Wednesday that she doesn’t deserve to hold the seat after she voted against the union’s interests during the 2023 legislative session. Instead, union leaders said voters should support Geoconda Hughes, a cardiovascular thoracic nurse practitioner and the daughter of former Culinary Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Arguello-Kline. Hughes announced her candidacy Wednesday at the Clark County Government Center, where she formally filed her paperwork to run as a Democrat for the seat, and will face Nguyen in the June primary election. The union on Wednesday also endorsed Democrat Linda Hunt, a food server at a downtown hotel-casino and a Culinary member for 45 years, for Assembly District 17, which covers portions of North Las Vegas. The Assembly Democratic Caucus already endorsed a candidate in the race, U.S. Air Force veteran Mishon Montgomery, setting up another primary fight for the seat vacated by incumbent Assemblywoman Claire Thomas (D-North Las Vegas) who is running for Senate District 1. Culinary Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageroge said Nguyen supportedSB441, which called for removing pandemic-imposed requirements placed on the gaming industry,including the cleaning of hotel roomson a daily basis. The debate over the legislation led to heated testimony from union members and gaming industry leaders when lawmakers heard the legislation in the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee. The bill passed out of both houses of the Democrat-controlled Legislature, with support from all Republican lawmakers, 10 Democrats in the Senate and 19 Democrats in the Assembly. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo signed the bill in mid-May. Hughes said she supported Nguyen in the last election but was “highly disappointed” by the senator during the most recent legislative session. “When she led the fight against housekeepers who were predominantly women,” Hughes said, “I reached out to her as a constituent about the bill she was backing to ensure she understood she would be hurting predominantly women. I never heard back as a constituent.” A spokesperson for the Senate Democratic Caucus said that Nguyen, who is part of the caucus and was endorsed by the group for re-election, has been instrumental in raising wages for health workers, leading the way to cap drug prices, advocating for clean energy and standing up for abortion access. “Just last year, she helped deliver the largest education budget in state history while serving on the Senate Finance committee,” the spokesperson said. “That’s why she’s endorsed by teachers, labor unions, environmental organizations, and reproductive rights groups. And that’s why she’ll be re-elected this year.” Nguyen did not immediately respond to a voicemail left on her phone Wednesday evening. Less than 24 hours after Culinary's announcement, the Clark County Education Association (CCEA) announced it was endorsing Nguyen. Ina post on X, formerly Twitter, CCEA President Marie Neisess wrote Nguyen “has been a fierce CCEA ally during her time in the assembly and the senate and will continue to fight on behalf of educators.” Pappageorge said that despite the contract settlements, the union doesn’t believe Nguyen should retain her seat. SB441 was sponsored by state Sen. Marilyn Dondero Loop (D-Las Vegas), who is not up for re-election this cycle, but Pappageorge hinted that she would have been targeted by the union as well. Culinary leaders were upset that Nguyen co-presented SB441 with Loop. “The Nevada Legislature worked with these big casino companies to get rid of our daily room cleaning law,” Pappageorge said. “Getting rid of that law hurt the guest room attendants who are the backbone of our union.” The announcement came after the union polled the issue in Nguyen’s district last year. Another bill the union supported that Nguyen opposed wasSB1, a measure to provide $380 million in public financing for the planned Oakland A’s baseball stadium in Las Vegas. Nguyen is a first-term state senator who was vice-chair of the Health and Human Services Committee. She previously served in the Assembly. The Clark County Commissionunanimously appointedNguyen to the seat after Sen. Chris Brooks (D-Las Vegas) resigned to take a position with a private-sector energy company.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indytalks-lombardo-vows-to-use-everything-available-to-retain-veto-power,True,"Gov. Joe Lombardo said he is “very worried” about the potential for a Democratic supermajority in both houses of the Legislature, which could give Democrats the ability to override any of his vetoes in next year’s session. During the 2023 legislative session, Lombardo issued a record-setting75 vetoes. In a candid conversation hosted byThe Nevada Independentlast week in Reno, he characterized this record as “unfortunate” and resulting from “communication and partisanship” issues with Democratic legislative leaders. Lombardo said he viewed the eventually vetoed bills as a test, saying Democrats were “seeing what I was willing to withstand.” He declined to say whether he spoke with Senate and Assembly leaders about bills he’d called “unacceptable” before vetoing them, but clarified that he didn’t believe Democratic leaders were acting in bad faith. “I think that was more of a testament to a change of party and leadership. And maybe it was a little bit of feeling me out,” Lombardo said. “But I don’t think it was bad faith. I think everything was well-intended.” He said statehouse control did not preoccupy him as a gubernatorial candidate in 2022, but said after the last legislative session, maintaining his relevance and determining the outcome of legislation during the 2025 legislative session is one of his top campaign priorities. He said that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told him last year that “single-party rule does not work” because there is no consensus building or discussion. Lombardo emphasized that voters should prevent one-party dominance. “The Democrats are trying to achieve a supermajority because they believe that’s to the benefit of the state, which I absolutely disagree with,” Lombardo said. “I have vetted candidates, I have identified candidates, I have recruited candidates, I am raising money for candidates to help with their success, to ensure that we prevent [a veto-proof supermajority].” Lombardo said he would “use everything available to ensure success,” including dark money, or money whose source is not disclosed. He has actively recruited and endorsed legislative candidatesboosted by a fundraising apparatusand even persuaded an Assembly Republican running for Congress todrop her bidand run for re-election to a swing Las Vegas district. Lombardo isn’t the only one highlighting the election’s stakes for legislative control. In a speech last Monday on the first day of candidate filing, Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) said Nevada voters are facing a clear choice this election cycle between Democrats “who are actually trying to solve problems and make life better for Nevadans, or Republicans, who offer nothing but complaints with no real solutions to any of the challenges facing Nevadans.” Democrats, Yeager said, are focusing on addressing the housing crisis and providing free breakfast and lunch at schools — issues that Democrats passed bills to address in 2023 that Lombardo subsequently vetoed. As PACs connected to Lombardo have characterized Democrats as participating in a “culture of corruption,” Lombardo said last week that he believes there is a culture of corruption in the Legislature because it is not subject to open meeting law and has little accountability. In recent months, Democrats have highlighted the Republican Party’s connection to false cries of stolen elections and support for former President Donald Trump despite his numerous scandals and court trials. Lombardo, who endorsed Trump ahead of the Republican primary, said that Trump and the Nevada fake electors are innocent until proven guilty. Democrats have also highlighted the Nevada Ethics Commission’s decision to censure and fine the governor $20,000 for using his sheriff’s badge and uniform on the campaign trail. Lombardo called the state ethics commission’s decision “stupid.” He said there’sno specific law addressing the issue, and the decision was based on a conflicting set of legal opinions. “I’m running for governor and I’m wearing my uniform associated with the profession I chose and provided as part of my campaign because I’m very proud of it,” Lombardo said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/as-national-support-dwindles-biden-campaign-ramps-up-efforts-to-court-black-nevadans,True,"Brian Harris wants his elected officials to focus on what he calls the “agenda of the people” — topics that include wealth inequality and home ownership. The 63-year-old Henderson resident is particularly passionate about protecting Social Security and diminishing the power of American corporations — key Democratic priorities — but said he does not feel that he belongs to a single party. Harris, who is Black, is exactly the kind of Nevada voter that President Joe Biden’s re-election campaign wants to engage early and often this election cycle. He was among the attendees at a North Las Vegas church breakfast late last month that heard from Cedric Richmond, a former Louisiana congressman and co-chair of Biden’s re-election campaign. Richmond spent most of his 15-minute speech at the Shepherd’s Breakfast — a monthly community breakfast at a North Las Vegas church — touting the Biden administration’s accomplishments on programs to support Black business owners and lift Black children out of poverty — kitchen table issues that Harris said had been overshadowed by the campaign’s focus on issues such as abortion access. “We don’t hear as much about these kinds of things that are being done,” Harris said. “They have done a good job, but I don’t think it’s been articulated.” Richmond, who also led a roundtable with young Black leaders that day, made the rounds in Southern Nevada as the Biden campaign ramps up its efforts in Nevada and around the country to court Black voters such as Harris. Five Black voters who spoke toThe Nevada Independentat those events all said they supported Biden’s re-election bid but with varying levels of enthusiasm. In Nevada, Biden’s campaign has made reaching out to Black voters an early priority. The presidentheld a pre-presidential primary rallyin Las Vegas’ Historic Westside — a neighborhood home toprimarily Black and Hispanic residents. The campaign also launched a $25 millionadvertising campaignin swing states, including Nevada, to engage Black and Hispanic voters, and participated in several Black History Month events across the state. Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who researches African American politics, said the campaign’s bigger concern should be Black voters staying at home, especially because of their overwhelming Democratic lean and Nevada’s status as a battleground state. “You can't just do passive activity, you can't rely on a media campaign,” Gillespie said. “You’re gonna have to ask people to turn out to vote, and you're gonna have to answer and listen to their concerns and their objections.” The polling Maintaining the support of Black voters — 92 percent of them supported Biden in 2020 — is critical to the president’s chances for re-election, but polls have consistently shown that the key voting bloc is much less enthusiastic about Biden than four years ago. The Black population in Nevada — 9.4 percent in 2022 — grew at the third-highest rate in the country from 2010 to 2022, according to thePew Research Center. APew Researchsurvey in January found that 48 percent of Black adults approved of Biden, much lower than his 58 percent approval ratinglast Apriland 89 percent approvalthree months into his presidency. “​​If we look back at the two prior Democratic presidents — President Obama and President Clinton — the approval rating of those presidents never, among Black Americans, got as low as Biden's approval rating currently is,” said Jocelyn Kiley, Pew’s associate director of research. A February poll fromThe New York Times/Siena Collegefound that 66 percent of Black respondents supported Biden, compared with 23 percent for former President Donald Trump. But of those respondents, 67 percent said they voted for Biden in 2020, while just 4 percent backed Trump. A November poll fromHarrisX/The Messengerfound that Biden had the support of 59 percent of Black voters nationwide in a rematch of his 2020 race against Trump. In an interview withThe Nevada Independent,Richmond downplayed the polling and said the campaign's goal is to have sound approval ratings at the time of the general election, not months before. “If everybody was energized today, the real question would be, ‘How do you keep that energy up for another 10 months?’” Richmond said. “We will continue to do the work that's necessary to build that excitement and enthusiasm.” The Trump campaign is also hoping to capitalize on Black voters’ lower enthusiasm for the Democratic Party.Exit pollsconducted after the 2020 presidential election found that 18 percent of Black Nevadans supported Trump, the highest mark in decades for a Republican presidential candidate. “We are creating a massive problem for the Democratic Party’s base that ... could be altering for a generation,” Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser on the Trump campaign,toldThe Associated Pressin January. “That’s just an opportunity that we would be remiss if we didn’t exploit.” The policies In both of Richmond’s Nevada events last month, he made an effort to show Biden’s actions to uplift Black communities. He referred to the coronavirus stimulus package that included$5 billion to Black farmers; efforts to root outracism in home appraisals; and the bipartisan infrastructure law thatmade permanenta Commerce Department agency focused on building up minority-owned businesses, among other economic policies. He highlighted the Environmental Protection Agency’splan to remove lead pipesfrom all American water systems and therecord-breaking nominations of Black womento appellate court judge positions. And he also acknowledged the challenges that Biden has faced, from a conservative Supreme Court thatstruck downhis effort to forgive billions of dollars in student loans, to a GOP-controlled House of Representatives in place since the start of last year. “What Biden is probably going to try to exploit from Black voters, many of whom have a strong sense of their racial identity … is try to draw sharp contrast on issues of race to leverage the perceptual advantage that the Democratic Party has enjoyed on civil rights,” Gillespie said. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is boosting efforts to engage Black voters. It is focused on bringing together conservative groups with presences in Black communities in battleground states to counter Biden’s messaging on race,NBC Newsreported. Polls show that voters still need convincing to support Biden. The FebruaryTimes/Siena poll found that just 17 percent of Black voters thought Biden’s policies have helped them personally, while 21 percent said Biden’s policies have harmed them. The rest said Biden’s agenda has not made much of a difference in their lives. In addition, much of the public is unaware of what the Biden administration considers its signature achievement. In August 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which brought historic spending to curb the effects of climate change and allowed Medicare to negotiate the costs of prescription drugs, among many other policies. In aWashington Post/University of Marylandpollconducted almost a year later, 71 percent of respondents said they knew “little” or “nothing” about the legislation. Richmond is aware of this information gap. “A lot of it right now is that people just don't know the accomplishments because they've been so busy breaking their backs to survive,” he toldThe Indy. Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus,toldThe Indylast monththe key to maintaining Black support is through communication. “Over 80 percent of Black voters support the Biden-Harris administration and their policies,” Horsford said. “I just need to make sure that those voters know what's at risk if they don't turn out to vote.” Notably absent, or mentioned sparingly in Richmond’s Southern Nevada remarks, were two issues prominent in Biden’s re-election campaign: abortion rights and the state of democracy. In an interview, Richmond said he focused primarily on the economy because he thinks the Black community is particularly invested in ensuring their financial future is secure. Melvin Valentine, who works in economic development and helps upscale underprivileged  communities in the Historic Westside, said in an interview that economy is the clear top issue for him and the community members he works with. “When people are swimming in poverty, then you have a cascade effect, then your mental health, then health, then violence in the community increases,” he said. “If you get that economic component correct, a lot of the other social problems and social issues go away.” Clark County Commissioner Will McCurdy, a Democrat who joined Richmond at the two events, said in an interview that economic issues are the top priority among his constituents. “When you think about the average everyday voter, they care about the cost of milk and butter and eggs, and whether their pension is going to be solvent or if their retirement is going to be there,” he said. Danielle Goodwin, 34, attended the Shepherd’s Breakfast and said it was beneficial to hear more about what the Biden administration has done to support Black communities. She also wants to see more of an effect on the local level — her friend started an urban farm in North Las Vegas but hasn’t seen any impacts of federal policies, she said. “We need it to trickle down a little bit more,” Goodwin said. The person Sharon Liles, 57, bases her vote on which candidates align with her values the most — and she thinks Biden fits the bill. The Las Vegas resident cares most about protecting voting rights, access to reproductive health and diversity, equity and inclusion policies. She acknowledged that Biden has faced challenges in his presidency, but that his values make him the best option, especially compared to Trump. Trump spent yearsspreading the conspiracythat former President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S., has facedaccusations of racist business practicesand referred to some African countries as“shithole countries.” Asked about what her family and friends think about Biden, Liles said, “there’s an excitement, but there’s also a desperation.” “It’s urgent that we vote correctly and not be stuck in a delusion,” Liles said. Liles is part of a group that the Biden campaign hopes to mobilize — one that bases their votes on morals and character rather than any one policy. Goodwin, the 34-year-old North Las Vegas resident, said the ability to win an election is a prominent factor in why she supports Biden. “People will vote for Biden, so I say yes [he is the right candidate],” Goodwin said. “I would love to see going forward another stepping up to the plate that are more representative of the population, what we want as a country. There’s a bit of a disconnect, slightly.” Richmond leaned into the character of Trump and Biden — asimilar strategythat led Biden to victory four years ago. In both of his Southern Nevada events, Richmond told the story of a conversation he had with Biden after a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which Trump infamously responded to by saying they were “very fine people on both sides.” “The former vice president gave me a call and he said ‘Cedric, this country's in trouble,’” Richmond said. Gillespie said this is likely part of a strategy to contrast Biden’s attitudes on race with Trump’s. “Racism could be framed as a character trait, and that's not something that's going to appeal to Black voters,” Gillespie said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indytalks-lombardo-doesnt-regret-housing-vetoes-wont-fight-abortion-ballot-measure,True,"In a wide-ranging conversation hosted byThe Nevada Independenton Wednesday night at the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Gov. Joe Lombardo defended his record-setting 75 vetoes from last session, pledged to make allocating $43 million in leftover COVID-19 relief funds to mental health a “first priority,” predicted with 99 percent certainty that the A’s would relocate to Las Vegas and made the case that a legislative supermajority by any party would be a bad thing. He also acknowledged that communication problems and his unfamiliarity with state government, rather than bad faith on the part of Democratic legislative leaders, led to the dramatic veto count. And he said he’s enjoying the governor’s job more than he expected because of its wide powers to enact change, giving his performance in his first year in office a B+. Lombardo said he still supports former President Donald Trump in spite of his indictments, saying more information has come out and Trump is innocent until proven guilty. But asked about his enthusiasm for the likely GOP nominee, the governor didn’t respond, saying, “Next question.” Here are takeaways from the IndyTalks event, moderated byNevada IndependentEditor and CEO Jon Ralston: Housing Lombardo said he did not regretvetoing numerous tenant protection bills, asserting that there is overwhelming evidence against the efficacy of rent control and that the heart of Nevada’s housing affordability problem is lack of available land. “And to me, that's the stopgap associated with it. It isn't because I’m friendly to the landlords versus the tenants,” he said. Although he said Nevada’s unique law allowing forrapid summary evictionsdoes nothing to address the housing affordability issue — which he said is one of the top two issues that worries him as governor, along with education — he acknowledged that an eviction can affect a tenant’s quality of life. Education Lombardo said the question of whether his historic, $2.6 billion K-12 funding increase has led to significant improvement in Nevada’s education system is “still unknown.” When he announced the spending boost at his State of the State address last year, he said he expected results in exchange. “And if we don’t begin seeing results, I’ll be standing here in two years calling for systematic changes to the governance and leadership in K-12 education,” he said at the time. What he was clear about on Wednesday night: whether he would have education fixed by next session. “Oh, God no,” he said. Lombardo also weighed in on the Clark County Education Association’seffort, via ballot measure, to reverse state law that prohibits teacher strikes. He said educators should not have that right, and instead, their frustrations with negotiations should be addressed. “I think collective bargaining works,” he said. Elections On Republicans nowfacing chargesfor submitting a false slate of electors in favor of Donald Trump in 2020, Lombardo acknowledged that he has “a personal angst with what was conducted there. I don’t understand the need to even have it done.” He reiterated his support for a voter identification requirement, and for guardrails on the practice of ballot harvesting. He said a lack of trust in elections stems from perceptions and facts around the problems inherent to a human-driven system. “I think you should put every, every available resource or stopgap into place to minimize that perception,” he said. Lombardo also indicated that he would “more than likely” endorse Republican Sam Brown in his bid for U.S. Senate. The governorissued a formal endorsementof Brown on Thursday after the event. Abortion Lombardo said that although he would vote against aproposed ballot measureenshrining abortion rights in the Nevada Constitution, he wouldn’t try to defeat it. He acknowledged that abortion rights, which have majority support in Nevada, pose “a huge problem” for a Republican Party that generally opposes the practice. “My personal belief is, it's pro-life with exceptions, alright? But I'm not going to wield that hammer onto the people,” he said. Energy and state climate plan After taking office, Lombardo’s administration quickly moved to withdraw Nevada from a cohort of states committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the2015 Paris Climate agreementandtook a state climate strategyaimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions offline. That state climate strategy isstill offlinemore than a year later. Lombardo said he decided to take the strategy offline because he considered it “regressive,” citing recent public outcry overskyrocketing natural gas and electricity billsas evidence that a rapid shift to clean energy would have an even more adverse effect on customer bills. “Until the green energy space, the wind and solar and those types of energy resources are to the level that they can support the entire system, we're going to have to continue the path we're going on currently,” he said. Lombardo said he’s pro-clean energy and believes in man-made climate change. Health care To meet the state’s needs for mental health resources, Lombardo said mental health is the “first priority” for allocating all $43 million of the state’s unused American Rescue Plan Act funding. “It's one-shot money. It's not for continuance of operations,” Lombardo said. “But it's the start of what we're trying to achieve in the health care space.” The governor cited his time as a law enforcement official, saying he has 35 years of experience with mental illness, which he described as a leading cause of homelessness and other societal problems. He also referenced anOctober 2022 report from the Department of Justicefinding that Nevada does not provide its children with behavioral health disabilities adequate community-based services and unnecessarily institutionalizes children, sometimes out of state. “We chose incarceration versus resources and help for the youth,” he said. “We're going to have to make some significant changes as a result of that.” Lombardo said one bright spot is theexpansion of the state’s provider tax. He said the money generated from the tax combined with matching federal funds should allocate $100 million over the biennium for children’s mental health. Film tax/A’s The governor said that he had a conversation with A’s owner John Fisher on Tuesday upon therelease of renderingsfor the team’s planned stadium in Las Vegas. He’s convinced there’s a 99 percent chance the relocation — boosted bya $380 million public subsidysigned by Lombardo to help with ballpark construction costs — will go through. Lombardo also said there was no special session under consideration right now to consider expanding film tax credits — an effort that fizzled at the end of the 2023 session but that the bill sponsorwants to revivein a pared-back format. He said that when he’s evaluating tax credits and other economic development incentives, he wants a return on investment. For every dollar the state subsidizes, it should get $40 in return. “I like economic diversification,” Lombardo said. “But the model has to fit … and it can't be an economic burden on the general fund of the state.” Guns Legislative Democrats and gun control advocates have pilloried Lombardo for hisvetoes of three gun control billsduring the 2023 legislative session. Lombardo said Wednesday that his decision to veto those firearm policies was more based on how litigation in other states has played out than being against gun control. “They don't pass constitutional muster, and that's a waste of money and everybody's [time],” he said. Asked what policies would reduce gun violence, Lombardo listed expanded mental health resources, so-called “red flag” laws with judicial review and universal background checks, which he described as “very beneficial.” He reiterated his opposition to constitutional carry, a policy that allows most law-abiding adults to carry a loaded firearm without a permit. “It's very troublesome to know that any random citizen, no matter what their mental stability is, can possess a gun,” he said. “I am pro-firearm,” he continued. “OK, I'm pro-Second Amendment. But I think everything requires a look.” Open government Lombardo elaborated on statements from his affiliated PAC that there is a“culture of corruption”in the Legislature, saying the body is not subject to open meeting laws and other public records laws. “I, as the executive branch leader who controls the state budget, has no insight into the legislative budget,” he said. “‘Just give it to me, governor, and don't ask any questions.’” He threw his support behinda list of bill draft requestsproposed by Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas), including ones requiring the Legislature to adhere to the open meeting law and offering the governor line-item budget veto powers. State government Lombardo acknowledged he does have some concern about state jobs remaining competitive while he iscracking down on remote work, but said it has not brought the negative consequences critics predicted. He said the state vacancy rate was hovering around 25 percent when he took office and has dropped 6 percent since raises and other interventions were implemented. The vacancy rate in the Nevada Department of Corrections has fallen 18 percent, he said, and the state police vacancy rate is down 6 percent. “The fallacy that if I made them come back to work, they're going to quit — it's not there,” he said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/video-game-composer-announces-gop-bid-for-congressional-seat-held-by-susie-lee,True,"Prominent composer, audio director and video game sound designer Martin O’Donnell announced plans to run for Nevada’s swingy Congressional District 3 seat as a Republican on Sunday, promising not to accept money from political action committees and pledging to “restore sanity to Washington.” O’Donnell’s announcement on the instant messaging and social platform Discord, first reported byGamesBeat, marks him as the fourth Republican who has announced plans to run for the Southern Nevada district represented by Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV). Lee has won the competitive district in the last three election cycles. “No one would pick a composer to fight their battles, but as Bono said, ‘Music can change the world because it can change people,’ so maybe it’s not so crazy after all,” O’Donnell, 68, wrote in his campaign announcement. Most known for his work on theHaloandDestinyvideo game series and composition of jingles for the Flintstone Kids vitamins and Mr. Clean commercials, O’Donnell’s LinkedIn page indicates hebegan working in Nevada in 2021as the owner of Marty M. O’Donnell Music, LLC. Clark County voter registration records indicate he registered to vote as a Republican in the county that July. In an interview withGamesBeat, he said that he moved to Las Vegas a few years ago to be closer to his grandchildren. In the interview,O’Donnell also said he supports former President Donald Trump and will vote for Trump in the fall. Though O’Donnell said he never expected he would run for higher office, he wants to live up to his civic duty and “put my money where my mouth was.” “I’m a Boomer and I’m a conservative. But I have not been a big fan of politicians. So I have a hard time even saying that I’m Republican, but I don’t really like what the Democratic representative has been doing here,” O’Donnell toldGamesBeat.“And so that’s why I’m running against them.” Since it launched in 2001, theHalofranchise hasgenerated more than $6 billion in sales. O’Donnell could bring a significant amount of money into the bid to unseat Lee, but without any corporate money, it could be mainly through self-funding. O’Donnell said his pledge not to take money from corporate political action committees is in contrast with Lee, who has benefited heavily from donations made by outside groups dedicated to protecting Democrats in battleground House seats. O’Donnell’s campaign is run by the same consultants who orchestrated Gov. Joe Lombardo’s successful gubernatorial run in 2022. His announced competitors in the Republican primary include former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien (R-Las Vegas), tax analyst Drew Johnson and former state Treasurer Dan Schwartz. Nevada’s candidate filing period opened Monday and ends March 15.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/d-c-download-horsford-on-how-the-biden-campaign-needs-to-win-over-nevadas-black-voters,True,"I sat down with Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) in his office on Wednesday to check in at the halfway point of his two-year tenure as the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). We talked about the challenges — over legislation and culture wars — that affected his first year, and his take on what Democrats down the ticket need to do to engage Black voters and to win Nevada. The view from NV-04 When I interviewed Horsfordlast Januaryabout his ambitions for the CBC, he talked about ensuring that the accomplishments of the last Congress — chief among them the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act — were implemented equitably in caucus members’ districts. He had hoped that those new programs would underpin his vision on advancing economic prosperity, including promoting homeownership and jobs for historically underserved communities. That vision has remained a focus, but it’s been somewhat undermined this year — from fighting Republicans’ attempts todefunddiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the military,reports of racial discriminationin mortgage lending, and the Supreme Court’sdecisionto end affirmative action in higher education. “I didn't expect to have to take on [these] issue[s],” Horsford said. “This fight came to me.” It’s been a lot of defense for a chairman who wants Democrats to play more offense. But with the attention of the presidential election shining on Nevada and specifically on Black voters, Horsford sees 2024 as an opportunity to promote his party’s record to voters and start laying out what he calls a Day One agenda for a second Biden administration — particularly if Democrats can recapture the House, which would require flipping just four seats. “I've said this to the administration: You can't just run off of what we've done — as good as that is — and the progress that we've made,” Horsford said. “You have to cast the vision for what we will do in the next four years.” Should Democrats be worried about Black voter engagement? Aspateofpollinghas the White House concerned about whether they’re reaching Black men — prompting meetings that have included Horsford. Black voters participated in the 2022 midterm at a clip 10 points lower than they did in 2018;November pollingfromThe New York Timesfound that a whopping 22 percent of Black voters planned to vote for former president Donald Trump, which would represent massive growth among a demographic group key to Democrats’ coalition. Horsford said he’s not worried about a small percentage of Black voters who might be moving rightward; he thinks Democrats need to focus their efforts on Black voters who are disengaged. As Vice President Kamala Harrisreportedly says, there’s concern about Biden losing to “the couch” rather than Trump. The Black Caucus chairman rattled off accomplishments that the Biden administration has achieved for Black people — thelowest Black unemployment ratein American history, thedoublingof Small Business Administration loans to Black businesses relative to 2020 and the temporaryrecord lowrate of child poverty as a result of the expanded child tax credit. The challenge, he said, is in communicating. “Over 80 percent of Black voters support the Biden-Harris administration and their policies,” Horsford said. “I just need to make sure that those voters know what's at risk if they don't turn out to vote.” To that end, Horsford said he’s encouraged the campaign to lean more into what he calls “the people in the policy” rather than the personalities of candidates that are very well-known andbroadly dislikedby the electorate. That means touting the people affected by Democratic legislation — veterans receiving health care through thePACT Act, seniors benefitting fromout-of-pocket capson insulin and prescription drugs, union workers who will be able to get jobs and train apprentices as a result of the federally fundedhigh-speed rail projectcoming to Las Vegas. Horsford cited Biden'srecent appearanceonLate Night with Seth Myersthis week as a step in the right direction, with the president addressing concerns about his age by saying that while he might be old, Trump’s ideas — namely on abortion — are older and regressive. And he wants Biden to use his March 7 State of the Union address to outline how a second Biden term will bring economic opportunity, particularly on issues where people are still feeling squeezed, like housing costs. Is he losing sleep over Democrats potentially losing the election? The 50-year-old Horsford — significantly grayer than when he first arrived as a freshman in 2013, in a photo he showed me of himself on the House floor with civil rights icon John Lewis and then-Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) — joked that his age makes him lose sleep rather than the election. But he said what concerns him more than November is the broader legal effort to erode what he sees as cornerstones of democracy — public education, misinformation undermining a free press and abortion rights among them. Evoking the civil rights and congressional leaders whose images dot his office walls, Horsford said his charge is to defend civil freedoms today to safeguard them for the next generation. “[In] Nevada, we are fortunate that we have been able to manage against some of the worst of these things,” Horsford said. “But that doesn't mean that if the right people don't get in, those rights, or opportunities or freedoms, are somehow just protected.” Around the Capitol 🍼Dems in on IVF— In the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court decision imperiling in vitro fertilization in the state, Nevada Democrats are lining up behind a congressional proposal to codify the right to pursue fertility treatments. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) are co-sponsoring a Senate proposal from Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), while Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) is supporting the House version of the bill. Duckworth attempted to pass the bill via unanimous consent Wednesday, but Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) objected. Lee revealed in a statement that she has been a beneficiary of IVF treatment — “Without it, I would not have my two incredible children,” she said. 📉The incredible shrinkflating product— With the president beginning to call out “shrinkflation” in the run-up to the State of the Union address, Rosen is getting in on the shrinkflation action (shraction?) with a new bill. Shrinkflation refers to companies shrinking the size of their products without lowering their prices — and often actually raising them. Rosen joined Sen. Bob Casey’s (D-PA)Shrinkflation Prevention Act, which would empower the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to legally challenge the practice as unfair and deceptive. Four of the bill’s sponsors — including Casey himself — are running for re-election in battleground states this cycle. 🏛️Mitch McConnell gives nine-month notice— The longtime Senate Republican leader, and rival of former Sen.

The Kentucky lawmaker’s tenure in the Senate has overlapped with eight different senators from Nevada.

Sign up for the newsletterhere. Does Brown’s abortion interview matter? Republican front-runner Sam Brown threw a curveball in Nevada’s Senate race last Wednesday when herevealed in an NBC interviewthat he would not support a federal abortion ban and respects Nevada’s current law protecting abortion up to 24 weeks. Brown’s comments, which came in the context of an interview alongside his wife, Amy, who revealed she had an abortion before she met her husband, represents a new frontier for Republican Senate candidates — some of whom have similar “don’t rock the boat” on abortion comments if elected. And numerous GOP Senate candidates,including Brown, followed the lead of theNational Republican Senatorial Committeein issuing statements in support of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment after Alabama’s conservative Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos have legal protections as children. But Brown, in personalizing the issue via his wife’s story and urging more compassionate responses for women, took the abortion question to places few Republicans have been willing to go. Doing so makes sense in a purple state such as Nevada where abortion has retained majority support andlegal protectionfor decades. In Republicans’ best-case scenario, Brown’s new abortion stance and defense of IVF will neutralize the issue in 2024, taking away the Democrats’ preferred campaign message. By taking abortion off the table, Brown could theoretically make the Senate race a referendum on an issue set more friendly to him — inflation, government spending and the border. Theoretically. National and Nevada Democrats met Brown’s announcement with skepticism, noting that the candidate has not been consistent on the issue. In a 2014 run for the Texas Legislature, Brownsaidsupporting the state’s 20-week ban was a “nonnegotiable” for him. In 2022, his campaign answereda questionnairesaying abortion should be banned in all cases except when the mother’s life is at risk — a survey hesaidwas filled out by a staffer without authorization. As recently as September, hesaid in a statementthat he was pro-life, which exceptions of rape, incest and cases where the mother’s life is at risk — a stance not necessarily incongruent with his latest pronouncement, but less specific about what he would be willing to support in Washington. And of course, a national banisn’t the only wayabortion rights might be affected post-November — if Brown wins the nomination, he’ll likely be sharing a ticket with Trump, whoreportedly supports a 16-week ban. In the wake of the Alabama decision, Democrats also want voters to blame Trump and Republicans for the imperiling of reproductive rights beyond abortion. The Democratic National Committee is running billboard ads in Las Vegas and Reno in English and Spanish starting Tuesday morning with a photo of Trump and the message “Banning abortion, stopping IVF: Is Nevada next?” While Brown is backed by national Republicans and has a massive fundraising advantage over his primary opponents, he still has to win in June against a host of candidates eager to outflank him on the right. Jeff Gunter, a dermatologist and former Trump ambassador to Iceland, took to X to call Brown a “RINO,” or Republican in Name Only, telling voters that as a physician, he couldprovide“moral clarity” whileaccusingBrown of “racing to the left.” Gunter had actually beat Brown to the punch in November, whenhe postedthat he did not support a national abortion ban. UNLV political science professor David Damore said he saw Brown’s interview as an effort to counter Democrats’ abortion messaging by staking out a more moderate position, buoyed by a personal story. But he said Brown might not be able to outrun people’s feelings about Republicans on abortion. “I don't know if it'll much matter, because the broader party dynamic is gonna shape a lot of people's perceptions,” Damore said. Democrats’ abortion offensive In 2022 and fresh off the Supreme Court’s repeal ofRoe v. Wade, Nevada Democrats rhetorically said that abortion was on the ballot. Now ahead of 2024, Democrats are now taking steps to make that literal. On Saturday, Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom officially launched a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion access in the state Constitution in a Las Vegas event briefly interrupted byanti-abortiondemonstrators. The question has so far received more than 10,000 signatures, but it must receive at least 102,586 signatures by July 8 to qualify for the 2024 ballot. As a proposed constitutional initiative, it would need to pass again in 2026. The effort has the backing of Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat and potential futurepresidential candidate, whose nonprofit poured $1 million into the initiative last year. He toldThe Nevada Independentin an interview that even though abortion is legal up to 24 weeks in Nevada via a ballot referendum that can only be overturned by another vote of the people, the Supreme Court’s overturning ofRoe v. Wadeunderscores the need for more protections. “Even though it may be codified into state law, it's not in your Constitution, and it's important to make sure that women now and forever going forward, have their freedom protected,” Pritzker said. At the same time, top Democrats in the state areteaming upwith abortion rights groups to paint former President Donald Trump and Brown as extreme anti-abortion candidates. Yet Democrats still need to convince voters that abortion remains a critical political issue. An OctoberNew York Times/Siena Collegepoll found that more Nevadans think abortion should be legal than anotherTimes/Siena polltaken a year earlier, but that fewer Nevadans viewed social issues, such as abortion, as most important to them. Pritzker said voters’ decisions are more nuanced than polls suggest. “[Voters] might say the economy is the most important issue and that abortion is second or third,  but when they're sitting there in the voting booth and making a decision, they're factoring in, ‘Does the candidate care passionately about something I care passionately about?’” Pritzker said. Adriana Perro, 23, attended Tuesday’s event and said she thinks that people may be putting abortion access on the backburner now, making spreading the word on the issue necessary. “Women are losing their rights every day,” she said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-allows-nevada-voter-id-ballot-measure-to-move-forward,True,"A ballot measure to require and implement voter identification could now be up for a statewide vote this year after a Carson City judge rejected a legal challenge filed against it. In his Monday ruling, Judge William Maddox said the ballot initiative is constitutional because its description of effect (a 200-word summary of the measure included on signature forms) effectively conveys to voters what the petition does. The judge also said it does not contain an unfunded mandate — dismissing arguments the legal challenge levied against the petition. “I think it’s probably time for voters of the state of Nevada to decide if they want this or not,” Maddox said from the bench on Monday. The initiative was proposed by Repair the Vote, a political action committee led by former Nevada Republican Club president and former Clark County GOP Chair David Gibbs. The petition aims to amend Nevada’s Constitution by requiring in-person voters to provide valid photo identification and those voting by mail to provide a personally identifiable number — such as part of a driver’s license number or Social Security number — alongside their signature. Nevada does not require voters to provide any type of identification before voting, but each voter is required to provide a signature that must match the one in the state’s files. Jennifer Fleischmann, the development director for the progressive immigrant advocacy group Make the Road Nevada, filed the legal challenge. Her legal representatives did not immediately respond to questions about whether she would be appealing the judge’s decision. The initiative by Repair the Vote marks the second time the PAC has tried to place a voter ID ballot measure in front of voters. Last year, ajudge orderedthe group to rewrite its “description of effect” because it was argumentative. The petition ultimately did not receive enough signatures and did not make it on the ballot. David O’Mara, who represents Gibbs and Repair the Vote, said that petitioners have been in the process of collecting signatures, but the effort is still in the early stages so the total number of signatures is unknown. “We are making really great strides in getting enough signatures to put this on the ballot in the next general election,” O’Mara toldThe Nevada Independentafter the judge’s ruling. “We're pretty confident that we will get the necessary ballot signatures that we need.” Understate law, petition supporters must gather and submit at least 102,362 signatures by July 8 to qualify for the 2024 ballot, with at least 25,591 signatures coming from each of the state’s four congressional districts. As a proposed constitutional amendment, it would need to pass twice in subsequent elections (2024 and 2026) to take effect. Asked about the failure to collect enough signatures last year, O’Mara said petitioners have “momentum” to ensure that Nevadans will understand that this will come before voters and people will be more confident when signing the petition. ANevada Independentpoll last yearfound a majority of Nevada voters strongly supported voter ID laws, which have been a key aspect of Republicans’ electoral reform efforts. Abillpushed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo this year to enact voter ID lawsstalledin the Democrat-controlled Legislature, and similar proposals have failed in prior sessions.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/secretary-of-state-apologizes-for-voter-record-glitch-after-nevadas-presidential-primary,True,"Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar publicly apologized Thursday morning for ahighly publicizedcomputer glitch that led to online voting records reflecting people participated in the presidential primary when they didn’t, and said that an in-the-works centralized voter registration system would prevent such errors in the future. Aguilar reiterated in a press release Thursday that the issue did not affect vote tabulation during the state’s recent presidential primary, and there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state. “No voter should ever look at the Secretary of State’s website and see inaccurate information,” Aguilar said. “This was a technical error that should not have happened, resulting from a patchwork, bottom-up voter registration system that has long needed to be replaced.” That statement echoed comments Aguilar, a Democrat elected to the office in 2022, made toThe Nevada Independentlate Wednesday as part of an interview for theOn the Trailpodcast, where he compared the 17 county systems and additional state system pulling voter data together to a technological “Frankenstein.” “We failed in that process,” Aguilar said. “And so I apologize [to voters] because I don't want any voter to ever feel as though they should be concerned about the information.” He also reiterated that the registration information and ballot tabulations were two intentionally separated systems. “The votes are actually accurate and right. There was no issue with the tabulation,” Aguilar said. Aguilar toldThe Nevada Independenton Wednesday that the state’s new top-down registration and election management system will go live in April, before the June 2024 election, and with enough time to conduct mock elections to test the new models. He added that Clark County already began using the system — which is separate from the one used for submitting voter histories — for the presidential primary, and that “it actually worked as intended.” Amemo issued by the secretary of state’s officeThursday said that the computer glitch was a “simple and preventable” discrepancy in how the state voter database interpreted data sent from individual counties. Officials wrote that the memo was based on the understanding of the situation from staff at the secretary of state’s office and is not intended to speak on behalf of counties. The office receives data from Nevada’s 17 counties and then stitches them into a single file — a “bottom-up” practice that officials said has not been the industry standard for decades. Through last Friday, the state’s database interpreted the code “MB” from files sent by 12 counties as meaning that a mail ballot had been sent to a voter. However, after Friday — the legal deadline for counties to canvass the results of the presidential primary election — the state’s system interpreted the “MB” code as meaning that a person’s mail ballot has been counted. This led the state’s public-facing database to erroneously show that the mail ballots of voters who did not participate in the presidential primary election had been counted.Data from the secretary of stateindicates that counties sent mail ballots to more than 1.1 million active registered Democratic and Republican voters, but only 165,756 returned their ballots as part of the presidential primary. The memo stated that the office became aware of the issues on Sunday, and that a solution could not be reached without consulting individual county staff the following day. By 8 p.m. on Tuesday, the office said all errors had been fixed. Issues and resolutions varied across counties. In 12 rural counties using the same election management system (Churchill, Elko, Esmerelda, Eureka, Humboldt, Lincoln, Lyon, Mineral, Nye, Pershing, Storey and White Pine), the problem was over a setting related to the “MB” code. Issues in Clark County stemmed from files that were sent to the state in a format that the “state system could not read appropriately, and resulted in inaccurate information.” Errors in Washoe County data took place because of the county’s election management system, which the vendor no longer supports. The memo said any regulatory changes that require adjustments to source code have the potential for error, and because the Washoe error was specific to its unique voter management system, identifying the problems and solutions was “complicated.” The memo also laid some blame on the “increasingly politicized climate around elections,” which has increased demands on county clerks and election workers, spurredsoaring turnover ratesand squeezed available resources. Any one of those issues, the memo said, combined with “the precarity of the bottom-up system currently in place,” could create “unfortunate outcomes.” “This was also the culmination of various issues that election administrators at the state and local level have been trying to address for years,” the memo said. New voter registration system At aThursday meetingof the Interim Standing Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections, Aguilar said that moving to a top-down system will prevent this week’s glitch from happening again. The first phase to modernize the system is set to go live on April 1, and efforts to further modernize and centralize the system are scheduled to go live in 2025. Clark County will not be immediately included under the same system as other counties. State officials said that the change will allow for standardized training among all election officials, reduce time to validate voter registration applications and allow for comprehensive maintenance of voter history. In 2021, the Legislature passedAB422, which called for creating the new system and established a January 2024 deadline. A year later, Deputy for Elections Mark Wlaschin asked lawmakers for an extension until 2026 and said that elections officials wanted to build the new system “properly, not quickly.” In 2023, the Legislatureapproved $30.5 million, including $25 million from the general fund, to support one-time costs for the project. Before that, the projecthad been fundedthrough grant dollars from the Help America Vote Act. County elections officials told lawmakers on Thursday that the new system will allow for greater oversight of voter activity and more election transparency. “It's one system, so a voter cannot go to Washoe County, and then two days later go to Clark County and try to vote. We'll catch those,” interim Washoe County Registrar Cari-Ann Burgess said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-senate-fundraising-rosen-donors-more-active-hail-from-more-states-than-browns,True,"A year before her bid for re-election, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) had already raised money from all 50 states and received the maximum amount from people who collectively poured six figures into the coffers of Democratic senators in other swing states, according to aNevada Independentanalysis of federal campaign finance data. Meanwhile, Republicans seeking to unseat Rosen — led by front-runner Sam Brown — have significantly less robust donor bases, with fewer and less active donors, less geographic diversity and less of a history of donating in Nevada’s past Senate races. The findings underscore Rosen’s massive financial advantage as an incumbent and the national attention that Nevada’s Senate race is receiving from active political donors, three campaign finance experts toldThe Indy. Theanalysis specifically looked at where in the country donors are from, past donating patterns by top contributors and whether donors also gave money in Nevada’s 2022 Senate race. The analysis only includes itemized donations from individuals made in 2023 — typically donations of $200 or more. These donations make up two-thirds of individual contributions to Rosen and more than half of Brown’s haul from individuals. If there’s any indication of the race’s importance, it’s the money. Rosen — one of several vulnerable incumbent Democrats whose seats are up in 2024 with the party’s control of the Senate at stake — has raked in more than $19 million in donations since entering office in 2019, including more than $11 million in 2023, ninth highest among all Senate candidates. At the end of the year, shehad $10.6 millionin cash on hand, meaning she has spent about half of the money she has raised. Brown is the front-runner among Republican hopefuls, buthis financial haul significantly trails Rosen. He has raised about $3 million —45th among all Senate candidates— but has the backing of national Republicans and their expected fount of outside money. In the 2022 Nevada Senate race, incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) raised more than $67 million throughout the course of the campaign and spent all but $3 million. Her Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, spent almost all of the $19 million he brought in. Cortez Masto ultimately won by fewer than 8,000 votes. Experts said this 2024 disparity is partially because Rosen has been able to fundraise for more than five years for her re-election bid, while GOP candidates only announced their intentions to run last year. They added the gap will likely narrow once the field dwindles after the June 11 primary. “Small donors, especially in Nevada who only have $100 to spend, want to make sure it goes to the nominee,” said Jeremy Gelman, a political science professor at UNR. “Once we see a winner in the summer, I would expect to see a significant spike in fundraising.” Rosen’s top donors were interested in multiple competitive Senate races; Brown’s less so One trend was noticeable among top donors (defined as giving the maximum amount of $6,600) to Rosen and Brown — they sent their money far beyond Nevada. The Indy’sanalysis looked at which candidates received at least $10,000 combined from Rosen’s top donors — a total of 196 individuals across 18 states. Of the six candidates receiving the most money from top Rosen donors, five are Democrats running for Senate in competitive races in Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) received the most money (more than $275,000) from Rosen’s top donors. The findings underscore Rosen’s position as one of the most vulnerable senators up for re-election in 2024 — her seat is one of seven occupied by a Democrat rated as a “Toss-Up” or “Lean Democratic,” according toratings from the nonpartisanCook Political Report. Republicans, meanwhile, only have two Senate seats at risk of being flipped, according to Cook’s ratings. Top donors to Brown — 73 individuals across 17 states — also opened their checkbooks to help candidates in competitive Senate races around the country. Tim Sheehy, a Montana Republican running to challenge Tester, received the most money from Brown’s top donors, raking in $52,800 from eight Brown contributors. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, who is running for the state’s open Senate seat currently held by Democrat Joe Manchin, received the third-most money from Brown’s top donors at around $36,000 from six contributors. “Political science research shows that certain donors, often donors that give a lot of money, seek out competitive races,” Gelman said. “And I think that's exactly what you see going on right here.” Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), who is running for re-election after ending his presidential bid, received the second-most money from Brown’s top donors. Top Brown donors also gave to a swath of well-known Republican members of Congress, including House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), who memorably served asspeaker pro temporelast year. However, Brown’s top donors were less likely to support outside candidates, with about half of them donating to no other candidate (about 90 percent of Rosen’s donors gave money to other 2024 hopefuls). Rosen and Brown's top donors also gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to PACs and joint fundraising committees, which raise money in conjunction with other committees. Super PACs can accept unlimited donations. Rosen’s top donors were much more likely to make large donations to PACs. Twenty-nine of her donors made six-figure donations to PACs, while only two of Brown’s top supporters made similarly large contributions. Rosen’s top donors combined to give more than $5 million to two funds supporting President Joe Biden: Biden Victory Fund and Biden Action Fund. Reid Hoffman, a top Democratic donor and venture capitalist, gave the maximum donation to Rosen and also gave $4 million to theRepublican Accountability PAC, a Republican-run group looking for the party to move on from Trump, $1.5 million to theFree and Fair PACand $1 million to theMainstream Democrats PAC. The PAC for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a strong supporter of Rosen, also received close to $900,000 from Rosen’s top donors. Brown’s top donors were most likely to give money to PACs backing Republican efforts to keep control of the House of Representatives, and they also gave money to committees supporting Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD) and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX). Rosen donors more likely to have donated in Nevada’s 2022 Senate race The 2022 Senate race between Cortez Masto and Laxalt had the smallest margin of victory among all Senate races that year despite Cortez Masto’smassive financial advantage. Data shows that a sizable part of Rosen’s fundraising base — around 36 percent of donors in 2023 — were people who also gave money to Cortez Masto. Together, these individuals gave more than $1.8 million to Rosen. On the Republican side, 21 of Brown’s donors — around 14 percent of all of his contributors — previously gave to Laxalt, and they have poured around $250,000 to Brown’s campaign. Brown ran an ultimately unsuccessful insurgent primary campaign against Laxalt in the state’s 2022 GOP primary. Sarah Bryner, the director of research and strategy at OpenSecrets, a nonprofit that follows money in politics, thinks that Laxalt donor disparity could spell trouble for Brown. Laxalt — a longtime Trump ally whoco-chairedthe former president’s 2020 campaign in the state — had the support of the Trump wing of the GOP, while Brown notably eschewed endorsing Trumpuntil last month. If Laxalt donors are so far not backing Brown, Bryner said that could indicate the Trump-aligned voters are not yet on board with him — though the campaign finance data comes from before Brown endorsed Trump. “Republicans [are] in a very tricky position because they want to run candidates like … Sam Brown — they want a return to some more mainstream candidates,” Bryner said. “But, from what we're seeing here, the donors don't.” Gelman from UNR said he would expect Brown, if he is the nominee, to bring in a different set of donors than Laxalt, who didnot raise much money from small-dollar donorsand instead relied on outside spending to help his campaign. But he emphasized that it is still very early in the cycle. “It's interesting that there isn't sort of a set of Republican donors that are consistently funding Republican Senate campaigns in Nevada,” Gelman said. “I think there's enough other complexities going on that it's hard to say what else is going on.” Other GOP Senate candidates have raised significantly less money. Jeff Gunter, the former U.S. ambassador to Iceland under Trump who has raised the second-most money in the GOP primary behind Brown (around $400,000), received donations from 12 people who also gave money to Laxalt, about 16 percent of his total donors. And 7 percent of donors to Jim Marchant, the former Nevada assemblyman and secretary of state candidate, also gave money to Laxalt two years ago. Marchant has raised less than $350,000. Six donors gave to both Brown and Gunter, and one donor gave to Marchant and Brown. A handful of donors have given money to candidates on both sides. Nine people gave money to Rosen after donating to Laxalt two years ago, including UFC CEO Dana White, who also gave to Rosen in 2020 but primarily donates to Republicans. Eight people also donated to Brown after giving money to Cortez Masto in 2022, including Troy Herbst, who helps run the Terrible Herbst oil company. Republican donors from fewer states than Rosen donors Since the start of 2023, Rosen has received donations from people in all 50 states, with the most donors coming from California, followed by Nevada. In 19 states and Washington, D.C., Rosen received money from at least 100 unique donors. In 2023, nearly 200 donors gave the maximum amount allowed under law to Rosen, but  5 percent were from Nevada. That patternfollows a similar pathas Cortez Masto in 2022. Bryner from OpenSecrets said that this kind of fundraising trend shows how big-dollar donor support is more about maintaining control of the Senate than anything else. “I bet you that most people who don’t live in the state, but who give to the people who are in theCookswing or toss up districtscouldn't tell you the first thing about Jacky Rosen's policy proposals,” Bryner said. Meanwhile, Brown received donations from people in 47 states — all except Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. He received the most donations from Nevada-based donors, followed by California and Texas, where Brown previously lived. In four states, he had at least 100 unique donors. Gunter has received donations from people in 22 states, with California and Texas leading the way. He’s received donations from six Nevadans. Marchant’s donors come from 23 states, and Florida — where he previously lived — makes up more than a third of his donors. He’s received donations from 16 Nevadans. Gelman said the geographical distribution is unsurprising. “To be successful in a really high-priced election, like a Nevada Senate race, they fundraise in California and in Texas, and in New York and Florida,” Gelman said. “That's just sort of where the money is.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/as-wife-discloses-abortion-story-nevada-gop-senate-hopeful-sam-brown-opposes-federal-ban,True,"Republican U.S. Senate candidate Sam Brown, a veteran and the likely front-runner to take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in the state’s 2024 U.S. Senate race, says he would not support a federal abortion ban if elected and will respect Nevada law allowing abortion up to 24 weeks. Brown’s comments came in an interview withNBCalongside his wife, Amy Brown, who revealed Wednesday that she became unexpectedly pregnant and had an abortion when she was 24. Amy Brown said she was serving as an Army dietician and was about to finish an internship and enter a full-time job. She had the abortion when she was five and a half weeks pregnant and told NBCthat the experience 16 years ago helped her empathize with women who had an unwanted pregnancy and were struggling with the decision’s consequences. “I just felt this immense amount of pressure that I had to do it. I felt all alone. I felt really overwhelmed, and I also felt a lot of shame,” Amy Brown said. “In that moment, I felt like my back was against a wall, and the walls were closing in, and I had one door out — and so I pursued that door.” Holding his wife’s hand during the interview, Sam Brown said that her story is a personal example that drawing a line in the sand or putting something on paper is “missing the point that there is at least a woman who is really going through something that might be one of the most challenging things in her life, and shame on us if we allow the narratives and the positioning to miss the fact that she was doing that alone.” The interview comes after an election cycle where abortion proved to be a motivating issue in Nevada, particularly for Democratic voters. In the state’s 2022 U.S. Senate campaign, abortion access was a winning issue for Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-NV) re-election bid, with the incumbentrunning hard on the issuebefore her narrow victory over Republican Adam Laxalt. AJuly 2022 pollof Nevada registered voters found that abortion ranked second behind the economy as the issue most motivating respondents to vote, and a KFF/AP voter survey last fallfound that for more than 4 in 10 Nevada voters, the Supreme Court overturningRoe v. Wadehad a major impact on who they voted for. Before the NBC interview, Sam Brown had avoided saying whether he would support specific limits on abortion nationally or within Nevada — a stance Democrats haveattackedhim for on the campaign trail. A Rosen campaign spokesperson on Wednesday pointed to Brown’spast involvementandsupportof anti-abortion organizations and said he “is a direct threat to Nevadans’ reproductive freedom, and he cannot be trusted to protect abortion rights in the Senate.” Amy said that when she first told her husband about the abortion, he understood that it was a “difficult decision” and was one that she “regretted.” But she did not feel judged by him. “Just having that bedrock of support and love from Sam and just feeling respected, having a safe space to process and then him sharing his faith with me really kind of put me on a journey where I could start healing from this.” Sam Brown in the interview expanded on his previous statements about abortion, saying that states should be allowed to set their own rules, but that he would not budge on his stance against a national abortion ban even if elected and if Republicans took control of the Senate and brought forward a national 15-week abortion ban, similar to the one proposed by Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC). As for hispast support for a 20-week abortion banas a legislative candidate in Texas nearly a decade ago, Brown said that he supported the state’s right to make that decision and that law would not apply to Nevada. Brown said he is personally “pro-life” and on his campaign website says he would support federal judges “who understand the importance of protecting life” and oppose bills that push for federal abortion funding, late-term abortions and abortions without parental notifications. But he insisted that he would respect Nevada’s abortion law that protects access to abortions through 24 weeks of pregnancy and after 24 weeks in order to protect the health of the mother, which Nevada voters affirmed via a 1990 referendum. “As someone who’s striving to represent Nevada in the U.S. Senate, Nevadans also need to know, voters need to know here, that I’m not in a position to — nor do I want to — do anything that changes our existing law,” Brown said. “I cannot change it. I will not change it. I respect the law that the voters put in place over 30 years ago that grants access for women up to 24 weeks.”This story was corrected on 2/21/2023 at 5:34 p.m. to reflect that Amy Brown was in a committed relationship when she became pregnant.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/leading-pro-abortion-rights-group-doubling-down-on-rosen-nevada-for-2024,True,"Reproductive Freedom for All, previously known as NARAL Pro-Choice America, formally endorsed Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) Tuesday — a foregone conclusion for a Democrat in a swing state Senate race. But formality of the endorsement aside, the group’s involvement in Nevada highlights a key part of Democrats’ strategy heading into the election — the potency of abortion rights as a motivating campaign issue two years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the legal right to an abortion. Nevada is one of four battleground target states for Reproductive Freedom this cycle, alongside Arizona, Georgia and Michigan. The organization boasts a 48,000-member base in Nevada that it hopes to activate to drive voter engagement — with plans to launch a campus organizing program, run a canvassing and phone and text banking operation and support efforts to get a constitutional amendmentguaranteeing the right to an abortionin the state on the ballot this fall, a strategy that has proven fruitful in driving voter turnout in states such asOhio. Democrats on the 2022 ballot benefited politically after the June 2022overturningofRoe v. Wade, igniting a groundswell of support for Democratic candidates among defenders of reproductive rights and placing the issue of abortion access squarely in the minds of voters. In 2024, the group — and Rosen — face the challenge of convincing voters that, more than two years later, abortion rights still matter. In a Tuesday interview withThe Nevada Independentin Las Vegas, president and CEO Mini Timmaraju said she expects abortion to be an even more potent campaign issue than two years ago, as more Americans have felt the impacts ofRoe’soverturning and former President Donald Trump — who appointed three of the Supreme Court justices that voted to overturnRoe— will likely be back on the ballot. “The farther we get from [the overturning], the longer the abortion bans have been in place,” she said. “The more time passes, the more horror stories are coming out, so it’s actually getting more salient.” ANew York Times/Siena pollfrom October found that 65 percent of Nevadans think abortion should be legal, up from 54 percent from anotherTimes/Siena polltaken a year earlier. The more recent poll, however, showed a decrease in Nevadans viewing social issues, such as abortion, as most important, while economic issues were viewed as increasingly important. Abortion is protected in Nevada up to 24 weeks by a1990 ballot referendum, and can only be undone by another vote of the people or afederal ban. Still, efforts to get abortion on the Nevada ballot are underway — a PAC affiliated with the political arm of Planned Parenthood isseeking a state constitutional amendmentthat would first go before voters in 2024, and Democratic state lawmakers are on track toplace a similar ballot initiativeon the 2026 ballot. At an event in Las Vegas announcing the endorsement of Rosen on Tuesday, the Democrats’ dual strategy of nationalizing abortion messaging while pushing for a state ballot question was on full display. Speakers singled out Sam Brown, the Republican front-runner to challenge Rosen, as a “rubber stamp” for any abortion legislation favored by Trump.The New York Timesreported last weekthat Trump has expressed support for a 16-week national abortion ban. “Do you think that Sam Brown, who endorses Donald Trump 100 percent, is going to go against what Donald Trump wants?” Rosen said at the event, referencing Brown’srecent endorsementof Trump. Brown has keptmostly mumon abortion this cycle. The self-described “pro-life” Republican oncesupporteda 20-week abortion ban a decade ago, but has dodged answering direct questions as to whether he would support a national abortion ban as a senator. Such a ban would require 60 votes in the Senate, and federal changes to abortion policy aremore likelyto come from a new administration or the Supreme Court. Asked in an interview about what ideal federal legislation would look like, Rosen did not answer directly. “What I would say is this: what Nevada has in statute now is pretty good,” she said. Rosen has been a supporter of theWomen’s Health Protection Act, a federal measure that would prohibit state governments from outlawing abortion prior to fetal viability, or after viability if the patient or baby’s life is in danger. Speakers voiced support for the effort to place a question on the November ballot to enshrine abortion rights in Nevada’s constitution. The measure, which is facinglegal challenges, needs to receive at least 102,586 signatures by July 8 to qualify for the ballot. If the measure makes it on the ballot and passes, it would be placed on the ballot again in 2026, when a second affirmative vote would add the language to the state Constitution. “We need it on the ballot,” Denise Lopez, Reproductive Freedom’s director of Nevada campaigns, said Tuesday. “Voters need to decide and protect our rights to abortion.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-election-officials-working-to-resolve-errors-in-online-voter-history-records,True,"The Nevada Secretary of State’s office announced it had fixed coding errors in files used to provide nightly updates on voter registration history that led to misreported records. In a statement issued by the office early Monday evening, officials said that some of the steps county workers are required to file in the system ”were not taken, resulting in inaccurate data” and re-emphasized that the errors did not affect the results of the presidential primary election. Specifically, officials explained that every county uploads its voter registration data to the secretary of state’s database each night. The secretary of state’s office then executes code to create a single voter registration file that users see when they log into the website. Officials said the legacy systems used by counties require additional steps to ensure voters who did not return a ballot or vote are indicated as such — additional steps that were not taken, resulting in inaccurate data. “This is an error that relates to the code used for when a voter is sent a mail ballot and does not return it; it has no connection in any way to vote tabulation,” Spokeswoman Cecilia Heston said in an emailed statement Monday evening. Heston reiterated that vote history is generated separately from election results, and the results onthe state's election websiteand county canvasses of the votes are “unaffected and accurate.” The issues arrived as the state is moving to a newtop-down centralized Voter Registration and Election Management System (VREMS)instead of a bottom-up system where individual counties report to the state, a change Aguilar has said is vital. “We need to have that [top-down system] in place by 2024 because it leads to other efficiencies in the flow and process of elections,” Aguilarsaid in an interview last year. Heston said the registration and election management system will go live before the June 2024 election, “and remove the need for these outdated processes.” Data from the secretary of state’s websiteindicatesthe Democratic and Republican presidential primaries saw record-high turnout, with more than 133,000 votes cast in the Democratic primary, representing a nearly 63 percent turnout for the party, and more than 79,000 in the Republican primary, or a 37 percent turnout rate. Congressional District 3 candidate Elizabeth Helgelienposted on X, formerly Twitter, that the problem is evidence of fraud taking place in Nevada, but did not explain how the issue constituted voter fraud. Shortly after the news broke about the technical issues, the Nevada GOPissued a statementnoting the party had received complaints from people who did not vote in the primary but received notification that their mail ballots were counted. The party said it would investigate “alleged irregularities in mail-in ballot counting” and is communicating with the secretary of state’s office. “These reports have raised serious questions about the security of the complex process of tabulating mail-in ballots in Nevada that needs to be addressed prior to the June Primary and November General Election,” the party wrote. In asocial media post, Gov. Joe Lombardo took a different approach from his party. He reassured voters that the voter history glitch does not affect vote tabulation and that the secretary of state’s office is “working diligently to resolve the issue with their website.” Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar and Attorney General Aaron Ford, who are Democrats, have reiterated that Nevada’s election processes are secure and that there aresafeguardsin place to prevent voter fraud, including procedures to investigate reports of potential voter fraud. “Our state runs some of the most accessible, secure elections in the country,” Aguilar said in aJanuary press conferenceahead of the primary.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-judge-strikes-down-independent-redistricting-commission-ballot-petitions,True,"A Carson City judge ruled Thursday that a pair ofproposed ballot questionsseeking to establish an independent redistricting commission are legally deficient and cannot be placed on the ballot. A senior judge appointed to the case, Robert Estes, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs represented by Bravo Schrager and Elias Law Group, a pair of Democrat-aligned law firms, with Estes agreeing with their arguments that thepetitions would violate the Nevada Constitutionby creating an unfunded mandate. They had argued the petitions — identical save that one that would have called for such a commission to redraw the state’s congressional and legislative maps in 2027 at the earliest and one that would have done so by the next redistricting cycle in 2031 — would violate the Nevada Constitution because they would create a new state body (an independent redistricting commission) without raising revenue necessary to pay for the expenses of the commission. The success of the Democrat-led lawsuits, each filed on behalf of Las Vegas-based Democratic voter Eric Jeng, means preserving the Legislature’s control of the redistricting process, which Democratic lawmakers last used in 2021 to bolster their structural advantages in state legislative and congressional elections. The organization backing the petitions, Fair Maps Nevada, began pushing the proposed ballot measureslate last year— the third attempt by the group to put an independent redistricting commission before voters in as many election cycles. Efforts in 2020 and 2022 were unsuccessful. Sondra Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada (CSN) professor who has helped lead the ballot initiative process, toldThe Nevada Independentthat she disagreed with the ruling about the latter petition, which would set up the independent commission to take over the redistricting process in 2031, when state lawmakers would next be required to redraw district lines after the decennial U.S. Census. Cosgrove said that petition would replace one funded body with another, arguing that the same funds used to support the Legislature during the redistricting process could instead be used to pay for the commission to carry out redistricting. She added that Fair Maps Nevada had not yet decided on its path forward and whether it would appeal either or both of the rulings. A new petition that included language funding the commission could potentially pose new challenges, such as violating the single-subject rule for ballot initiatives, she said. Cosgrove said the judge’s order in each case had not yet been released as of Thursday. The Carson City District Court clerk’s office did not respond to a phone call Thursday afternoon. Supporters have argued that an independent redistricting commission would remove partisan biases from the redistricting process, undoing district gerrymanders that have minimized some voters at the expense of others in pursuit of maximizing partisan control of legislative bodies. Nevada’s electoral maps were last redrawn during the decennial redistricting process in 2021. However, under unified Democratic control of the Legislature and Gov. Steve Sisolak, those maps were drawn to maximize the number of competitive districtsfavoring Democratsin congressional and legislative races. The new maps led to a supermajority for Democrats in the Assembly and near-supermajority in the Senate in 2022, even as Republican Joe Lombardo bested Sisolak in the race for governor. A potential veto-proof supermajority ison the table againin the 2024 election, which could allow Democrats to stymie Lombardo’s agenda just two years after he issueda record number of vetoes. An analysis by Princeton University’sGerrymandering Projectgave Nevada’s congressional maps an “F” grade for partisan competitiveness, citing a “significant” Democratic advantage. The project found more subtle advantages in legislative maps, giving the state Senate map a “B” grade for a “slight” Democratic advantage and leaving the Assembly map ungraded. Historically, past Nevada redistricting fights have been defined bysplit control of state government. In 2011, Republican Gov. Brian Sandovaltwice vetoedmaps proposed by the Democrat-controlled Legislature, sending the redistricting process to a three-person panel of “special masters” to draw up mapseventually approvedby a Carson City judge. In 2001, debates between Republican Gov. Kenny Guinn and the Democratic Legislatureforced a special sessionto finalize new maps. Nationwide, about 19 percent of all congressional districts are drawn by independent redistricting commissions, compared with 21 percent of districts that are drawn by courts and 52 percent controlled by partisan legislatures, according toan analysisby the Brennan Center for Justice.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-nevada-presidential-primary-turnout-beat-caucus-records,True,"The results of Nevada’spresidential primaries(and caucus) last week were staggering, albeit unsurprising. The presumptive nominees scored dominating victories — President Joe Bidenwon the Democratic primarywith more than 89 percent of the vote and former President Donald Trumpwon the Republican caucuswith more than 99 percent. In the only contest that really mattered (yes, putting aside the delegates that Biden and Trump each swept up), former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haleylost to no one. One potentially surprising outcome: turnout in the primaries beat all-time records for caucus turnout in Nevada. (The GOP caucus turnout of about 60,000 votes was not a record-setter, despite Trump’s claims to the contrary.) On the Democratic side, primary turnout reached nearly 135,000, beating the 2008 caucus record of 118,000. On the Republican side, primary turnout surpassed 80,000, topping the 2016 caucus record of 75,000. Despite the lack of competition, the change to a primary — away from the traditionallow-turnout caucus— for the first time in four decades helped boost voting. Here’s how it happened. Mail ballots were the main driver Unlike the party-run caucus, which relied almost exclusively on in-person voting during a short block of time on a Thursday night, the primaries were run by state and local officials following the same election laws that govern other Nevada elections and offer a lengthy window and multiple ways to participate. Because of a 2021 law establishing universal mail voting, every Nevada voter registered as a Democrat or Republican received a mail ballot. Though voters returned just 15 percent of the1.1 millionmail ballots sent out last month, they were instrumental to the record turnout. In the GOP primary, nearly 61,000 Republican voters cast ballots by mail that were accepted for counting (officials rejected a small share of mail ballots in each primary for a variety of issues, such as a missing envelope or stray marks). That amount alone exceeded the roughly 60,000 votes cast in the caucus. In the Democratic primary, the number of mail ballots cast (nearly 108,000) was higher than the number of votes cast in each of the past three caucuses. There is also some historical evidence from Nevada’s past history of presidential nominating contests to further prove mail ballots’ relationship to turnout. In 1996, Nevada Republicansheld a primary— a temporary move away from the caucus — conducted entirely via mail ballots. That contest saw more than 140,000 voters cast ballots, ahead of the records set in each party’s primary this year. Do the records mean anything? Yes, the raw totals set records. But it may be difficult to judge how much of that is really a product of voter enthusiasm. In-person turnout alone was about 27,000 in the Democratic primary and 20,000 in the Republican primary, closer to the abysmallylow numbers of the 2012 caucusesthan any other point of comparison. Turnout in this year’s primaries as a percentage of the number of voters was actually lower than in past years. In the previously turnout record-setting 2008 Democratic caucus, about 27 percent of registered Democrats voted, compared with less than 23 percent in this year’s primary. In the 2016 GOP caucus, more than 17 percent of registered Republicans voted, compared with less than 15 percent in this year’s primary.(Editor’s Note: These numbers are based on the latest available data on active registered voters in each party, and may not account for changes leading up to the election such as voters changing party using same-day registration.) Even with a caucus, where voting required more steps than checking the mail and dropping off an envelope, those were more competitive contests (Trump on the rise in 2016, Barack Obama against Hillary Clinton in 2008), and they garnered more votes from partisan voters at the time. Are there any takeaways for November? Partisan observers may be quick to draw general election conclusions from those record numbers or the margin of victory of each contest. The Nevada Democratic Party, for example, described the turnout numbers as proof Democratic voters are ready to deliver Biden a win in November and that enthusiasm for Trump is low. But recent history shows why such extrapolation is difficult. Democratic and Republican turnout in the 2012 general election was higher than in 2016 and 2020. Despite lower turnout in the caucuses, particularly on the Democratic side where Obama had the nomination locked up on the way to his second term, a higher share of Democrats turned out in November that year than in other recent years. So remember: Don’t extrapolate these turnout numbers to expect anything particular come November. But one thing is clear from the primary and caucus turnout: Nevadans are increasingly favoring mail ballots as their preferred method of voting.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-much-does-money-matter-in-close-nevada-legislative-races,True,"In Summerlin, Democratic Assemblywoman Shea Backus (D-Las Vegas) is fighting to retain her seat in a race pivotal to her party’s efforts to attain veto-proof supermajorities in the Legislature in 2025. But entering this year, Backus was far behind in the fundraising battle against Republican David Brog, whose $150,000 haul in 2023 more than doubled hers. The outcome of the race and only a handful of others could shift the balance of power between the Democrat-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who is backing Republican candidates who have the potential to unseat Democratic incumbents in competitive districts. Soon after it was clear Brog had the fundraising advantage, a pro-Lombardo PAC pounced. “He's well-positioned to flip this crucial seat in November!” the grouppostedabout Brog, citing anarticlethat said Brog’s fundraising numbers “spell trouble” for Backus. Fanfare around fundraising is not a new phenomenon. In legislative races, money — who has it, who is giving it, who is raising it — is a significant part of winning elections. But candidates and political insiders say other factors matter, too, including the number of voters a candidate speaks with, incumbency, name recognition and how candidates choose to spend their money. It all begs the question: Just how significant is the money? To answer that,The Nevada Independentanalyzed fundraising totals at this point in the election cycle in all competitive legislative races since 2016 (those ultimately decided by less than 5 percentage points). The analysis of 28 races found that candidates who raised more money the year before an election prevailed more than two-thirds of the time. In this year’s elections,The Nevada Independenthas identified eight races that are likely to be the most competitive, including Backus’ seat and two other Democrat-held Assembly seats. Republicans, so far, have a slight fundraising lead in those contests. For Lombardo, Republicans outspending established Democrats and winning those swing seats will be thekey to preventing Democratic supermajorities and protecting his veto power. Democrats hold a two-thirds supermajority in the Assembly with 28 of 42 seats. In the Senate, they control 13 of 21 seats, one shy of a veto-proof supermajority. Political insiders note that how money is spent is just as important as how much is raised. Coordinated efforts such as door-knocking for multiple candidates and sharing a unified message can help stretch money further. Candidates also need to make a strong case to voters for why they should be elected. Democrats have an advantage in the form of the “Reid Machine,” a political apparatusbuiltby the late U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) that leverages organizing strength intoelectoral wins. The party further bolstered its structuraladvantagesthrough control over the 2021 redistricting process, which saw Democratsredraw state mapsto give them a leg up in voter registration in competitive districts. “Fundraising is important in legislative races, but you’ve got to remember that the candidates running for the office matters the most,” Backus said in a recent interview. Brog said money is “important but insufficient.” “The real work of a campaign is to meet the voters, to listen to their recommendations and concerns, and to share my vision for our state,” Brog said. Money, what is it good for? To get a better sense of the connection between fundraising and victory,The Nevada Independentalso interviewed nine political insiders, including Democratic and Republican consultants and lobbyists, on the condition of anonymity so they could freely share their thoughts. The consensus: Money can make a difference in reaching voters through advertisements, campaign flyers and other avenues, especially in a saturated political environment where down-ballot elections receive less attention from voters. Perhaps just as important, it serves as a signal to donors, the media and politicos of which candidates are committed to winning and who may be vulnerable to defeat. Historically, incumbents and legislative leaders have raised more money than other candidates. Still, early in the election process, donors tend to hedge their bets, waiting to see what candidates will do before pouring more money into legislative races as the campaign season progresses. As one political consultant noted, there’s no reward for picking early unless there’s a strong reason to do so. For candidates, bigger bank account numbers and fundraising hauls can indicate whether they are well-equipped for the campaigns and allow candidates to get a head start on voter outreach, such as by purchasing mailers, officials with both parties said. Brog, for example, has already spent $33,000 of the money he has raised on various services, including consulting, advertising and office expenses. “Hopefully when I show up at a voter's door, it won't be the first time they heard my name,” he said in an interview. For donors, contributing dollars to candidates can be a symbol of the donor's own wealth and influence or a signal to others about where they stand. But those industry dollars matter just as much to candidates looking to project strength, too, according to UNR political science professor Jeremy Gelman. “In political science, we often talk about how candidates build war chests as a way to deter challengers,” Gelman said. “Essentially, the money signals to people who might consider running against them and that this is going to be very difficult if you try and do this.” For candidates, the money can also be a way to solidify alliances and curry influence — especially for existing or would-be legislative leadership — as they support fellow candidates who may later help determine committee appointments and build consensus before votes on those leadership positions. “Money — we often think of [candidates] pumping it into their campaigns, but it's actually doing a lot of different things,” Gelman said. The role of political action committees There are three general avenues for making donations within the political world: political action committees (PACs), at the caucus level or individual candidates. PACs can allow donors to contribute more money to races that help a cause or group of people, whereas caucus donations are a more general and discreet way to support a candidate within a broader party. At the individual level, donations act as a show of direct support. Broadly, those familiar with Nevada’s election system say money is spent in higher quantities in districts where the voter registration margins are narrower and, therefore, more competitive. PACs, corporations and labor unions typically spend more on ads, mailers and canvassing in these races. This spending is referred to as independent expenditures, or spending done independently of a party or candidate. Democratic and Republican operatives emphasized that independent expenditures allow groups to be negative in battle against the opposition, leaving individual candidates to tell their own stories more positively. Historically, Democrats have relied on a network of well-funded PACs to spend on broad messaging across races. In 2022, for example, the Democratic New Day Nevada PAC spentnearly $3.5 million, while a PAC supporting Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak spentnearly $24 million, much of it on advertising. In the Assembly races, Lombardo’s Better Nevada PAC has focused attacks on Democratic incumbents, criticizing a group of them forfunding nonprofits some had ties toand accusing Democrats of participating in aculture of corruption. One target of those attacks, Assemblywoman Michelle Gorelow, a Democrat in a Las Vegas swing district, has already decidednot to run for re-election. Where does the money stand in the competitive races? These races — six in the Assembly and two in the Senate — were chosen based on a combination of voter registration breakdown, past election results and the Princeton University Gerrymandering Project’sanalyses of Nevada’s redrawn district maps, which includes an estimate of Democratic and Republican vote share in each district, a metric based on recent election results that accounts for voting patterns in a district regardless of voter registration. Candidates in those competitive raises combined to raise more than $1.8 million in an election off-year and during a year in which lawmakers were legallyblacked out from fundraisingfor nearly half the year. So where is that money coming from? More than a sixth of that money came directly from candidates contributing to their own campaigns. This practice allows wealthy candidates with less-established fundraising operations to prop up their campaigns, especially early on. And unlike normal contributions, which are capped at $10,000 per donor, these self-funders can loan themselves unlimited amounts. Contributions from the accounts of other lawmakers also constituted one of the biggest sources of donations to candidates in the eight competitive races analyzed. Together, they contributed more than $143,000 to 12 candidates — five Democrats and seven Republicans. Thepro-Lombardo machinewas also at work. Seven candidates in these races received contributions from the Nevada Way PAC totaling $22,500. Beyond that, many of the typical top donors to legislative candidates emerged at the top, including a group representing trial lawyers ($27,000 to four candidates), utility power player Southwest Gas ($16,500 to six candidates) and the Howard Hughes Corp.-owned Summerlin community ($20,000 to four candidates). Across the eight races analyzed, Lombardo-backed candidates reported higher fundraising totals than Democratic candidates endorsed by the party’s legislative caucuses in four races. That includes Senate District 5, a Las Vegas-based district represented by Carrie Buck (R-Las Vegas), who is seeking re-election. Challengers in each party have outraised both establishment-backed opponents, including Buck. In another three races, Democratic contenders held the lead. The race for Assembly District 35 is an outlier. No Democratic candidate has announced for the race yet to replace incumbent Gorelow, and Lombardo has not endorsed either of the Republican candidates who have announced their intentions to run for the seat — doctor Rebecca Edgeworth and attorney Brittany Walker Hausle. One seat not included in this analysis is Senate District 15, where the announced departure of Senate Minority Leader Heidi Seevers Gansert (R-Reno) has paved an opening for Democrats who redrew the district’s lines in 2021 to include significantly more Democratic voters. Though two Democrats — a Reno city councilwoman and an assemblywoman — are competing for the seat, no Republican candidate has announced a campaign to succeed Gansert. What past elections can teach us Historically, the number of competitive legislative races has ebbed and flowed in Nevada, often at the whims of redistricting, political realignment, demographic trends and the political macro-environment. But whether candidates with the cash advantage ultimately win those close races is no exact science. In 2022, all six candidates who won tight races held financial advantages at the end of September just weeks out from Election Day. However, two incumbents who won re-election had entered the election year behind their opponent in fundraising. That was a slight change from 2020, where seven of eight winners in tight races had the financial advantage a year before Election Day. In the 2018 midterms — a cycle defined by sweeping Democratic gains nationwide, and in Nevada specifically, the first election of a Democratic governor in two decades — competitive legislative seats split evenly, 3-3, between candidates with an early money advantage and candidates without. However, two of the races won by the candidate with less money were decided by razor-thin margins, including the Senate race between Republican Keith Pickard and Democrat Julie Pazina, which was decided by just 24 votes. The third, Assembly District 31, was in the throes of a yearslong seesaw between Democrat Skip Daly and Republican Jill Dickman, who ran against each other in four consecutive cycles and traded wins three times (Daly won in 2018 and is now a state senator). The 2016 election was similarly scrambled. Of eight close races, five candidates with the money disadvantage went on to win, alongside three advantaged candidates. Of the five disadvantaged candidates who won, three were Democrats challenging Republican incumbents who had secured their seat in the 2014 Republican wave. Another Democrat, Brittney Miller (D-Las Vegas), won an open contest in Assembly District 5, and only one Republican, Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas), managed to win a competitive race without the money advantage. How redistricting changed the playing field Only one of the past elections analyzed — 2022 — came after the Democrat-led redistricting process in 2021. At the time, party leaders sought to gerrymander legislative districts in a bid to maximize the number of winnable seats. Under the right electoral conditions, the new maps would create a cascade of narrow Democratic victories by cracking deep-blue districts into nearby swing seats. Under those new maps, Democrats in 2022 flipped two more Assembly seats to secure a supermajority for only the fourth time since 1998. In the Senate, they flipped one seat to push their majority to 13 seats — one short of a supermajority. Neither party has had a supermajority in the Senate for decades. In 2024, Republicans have lamented the lines of the district maps, lines that they say have limited the number of seats they can vie for because Democrats have given themselves a substantial structural advantage. ""By engaging in blatant partisan gerrymandering, Democrats disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of Nevada voters by allowing politicians to pick their voters instead of the other way around,” said John Burke, a spokesperson for the pro-Lombardo Better Nevada PAC. In 2022, across nine Senate races featuring a candidate from each party, Democrats received 201,000 votes and won seven seats, while Republicans received 204,000 votes and won just two seats (GOP candidates also won two other state Senate seats unopposed). The trend continued in the Assembly — across 35 Assembly races with a candidate from each party that year, Democrats received 397,000 votes and won 28 seats. In those races, Republicans received 376,000 votes (a difference of 21,000 votes) and won just seven seats. They won an additional seven in races with no Democratic candidate. If spread evenly across the races, the margins between Democrat and Republican votes would yield an equal number of seats for each party. But under the redrawn maps, Democrats won large majorities. Still, Gelman — the UNR professor — said that gerrymanders, however well constructed, maintain the capacity to change as time goes by. Mercurial shifts in demographics, political realignments and the unending churn of people in and out of Nevada might ultimately upend lines on a map, that “at the end of this cycle, we may look back and be surprised.” “Have [Democrats] guaranteed themselves a supermajority? They’ve certainly made it easier for themselves to achieve it,” Gelman said. “But by no means do I think it’s guaranteed.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-sweeps-nevada-republican-caucus-in-race-with-no-major-challengers,True,"Former President Donald Trump easily won Nevada’s Republican caucus in a race where he was functionally the only remaining candidate on the ballot, according to returns released  Thursday night. With more than 60,000 votes counted as of 5:36 a.m. Friday, Trump led with 99.1 percent of the vote. That included 99 percent support in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and accounted for roughly half (29,900) of those votes. The Silver State win secured 26 delegates for Trump, his largest single delegate haul thus far, and another electoral victory heading into a Republican primary in South Carolina later this month that could seal the 2024 Republican nomination for the former president. Ryan Binkley, a Texas banking CEO and pastor, was the only other active candidate on the caucus ballot. Early returns showed him with less than 1 percent of the vote. Four additional candidates — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — filed to participate in the caucus last October but ended their campaigns well before Thursday’s contest. Trump’s Nevada win follows victories in Iowa — where he beat second-place Ron DeSantis by nearly 30 points — and New Hampshire, where he bested former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley by about 11 percentage points. Hours before Nevada’s caucus Thursday, Trump also wona caucus in the U.S. Virgin Islandsby 48 points. “If we win this state, we easily win the election in November,” Trump told a crowd at the Treasure Island in Las Vegas Thursday night after the race was called. “We have to win the election.” It also comes after another de facto Trump win Tuesday, after“none of these candidates” trounced Haleyin Nevada’s nonbinding Republican primary by a 2-1 margin. Of the original Republican field, only three major candidates — Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) — filed to run in the primary, but Pence and Scott also ended their campaigns early. The state Republican Party adopted rules prohibiting candidates from running in both contests, with delegates only allocated to caucus participants. The Trump campaign seized on the result this week, saying in a statement that Haley’s defeat was “humiliating, embarrassing and utterly overwhelming.” The result also provided cover for the campaign, which had begun to worry internally that Nevada’s caucus result could prove hollow if turnout dipped too low, according to a report fromAxios. Read more:‘The Trump train is a-comin’’: Nevada Republicans descend on GOP caucus sites ‘Is there any way we can call the election for next Tuesday?’ At a victory party on the Las Vegas Strip — at a resort owned byTrump megadonorPhil Ruffin — Trump appeared eager to take the contest directly to President Joe Biden. In remarks that lasted less than 15 minutes and that came well before any substantial results were reported from Clark or Washoe counties, Trump pivoted to poll numbers that show him leading Biden in key swing states, asking: “Is there any way we can call the election for next Tuesday? That’s all I want.” Without any public confirmation from the state party, Trump also claimed turnout Thursday eclipsed the record Republican caucus turnout of 75,000 set in 2016. When Trump left the stage just after 9:30 p.m., only 371 votes across six rural counties had been reported — thoughseveral thousand voterswere reported by media outlets earlier Thursday at voting sites in Southern and Northern Nevada. Around 10 p.m., a tranche of more than 23,000 votes from Clark County pushed Trump’s margin of victory over 99 percent — exceeding the 22,600 votes Haley received in the primary.  However, by early Friday morning, turnout had only reached about 60,000 votes, well short of the 2016 record. In a speech delivered alongside Burgum and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Trump hammered immigration and called on the Supreme Court to “preserve democracy,” an apparent reference to a caseheard Thursdayconcerning whether states have the power to kick Trump off the ballot using the 14th Amendment. “The Supreme Court, hopefully, will be doing something in terms of helping our country and preserving democracy,” Trump said. “We have to preserve our democracy.” Trump also nodded to Haley’s Tuesday loss — sarcastically congratulating “none of the above” on their primary win. Burgum, taking the microphone briefly, said Nevada sent a signal to the nation: “This primary is over, President Trump has won.” Watch party turned victory party Enthusiastic Trump supporters filled a ballroom at the Treasure Island, several wearing white hats with “Team Trump Captain” embroidered to show off their role as caucus captains, who were in charge of tallying the votes. Eva Landau served as a caucus captain on Thursday evening. She said she regained trust in the electoral process after seeing and being part of the hand counting. “This was very, very exciting … That's the way it's supposed to be — the election. You count by hand,” Landau, wearing a red “Latinas for Trump” T-shirt, said. “You say, ‘okay, Trump.’ Show to the camera, show to the people, one line until you get five, right? That's the transparency that we need in the United States.” For Landau, a 43-year-old originally from Bolivia, immigration, border security and human trafficking are her main concerns. Those issuesdominated Trump’s speechduring a rally in East Las Vegas two weeks ago. When asked how well Trump is appealing to Latino voters, which polling has shownare keyto winning elections, Jesus Marquez, a political consultant and long-time Trump supporter, toldThe Nevada Independentthat he saw “a lot” of Latino faces at the caucus location he attended. “Just the fact that Latinos are getting involved with the caucus, [is significant because] that is not normally the case,” Marquez said. “[Trump] didn't just win but he made the people turn out to vote … even though there was no competition for him in this caucus, this is the initiation of a grassroots operation to win the state in November. This is the beginning of that — we're already in a general election mode.” One week, two elections This week’s bifurcated Republican contests — primary and caucus — are the end result of a monthslong dispute between a Nevada GOP determined to hold a traditional caucus and a 2021 state law creating presidential preference primaries for both major parties. Under that 2021 law — passed under unified Democratic control of state government — a state-run primary would be held so long as at least two candidates filed. It was a prelude to a move by the Democratic National Committee to bump Nevada up its nominating calendar, a moveopposed at the time by Republicans. The Nevada Republican Partysued the state to stop the primaryin May 2023, roughly four months before it would finalize the decision to hold the caucus. In July,a state judge ruledthat both a primary and a caucus could move forward. Republicans and the state eventuallyagreed to drop the suitin January. But the state GOP has pitched its caucus as a way to reject many of the Democratic-backed election policy reforms adopted since 2020, including universal mail ballots. Under party rules, the caucus required in-person voting barring select exceptions, and pledged to use paper ballots, voter ID and a ban on super PAC participation in the caucus process. However, Republicans critical of Trump have criticized Nevada’s caucus rules as designed to benefit the former president. The super PAC ban in particular was derided by DeSantis’ super PAC, Nevada Back Down, as having “rigged” the process. Haley, who avoided Nevada outright,called the processa “scam” and “rigged from the start.” Also scrutinized: the myriad ties between state party leadership and the Trump campaign. Four party leaders — Chair Michael McDonald, Vice Chair Jim Hindle, National Committeeman Jim DeGraffenreid and Clark County Party Chair Jesse Law — were among six individualsindictedlast year for their alleged role in the “fake elector” scheme designed to keep Trump in power after losing the 2020 election. A report fromThe New York Timeslast year found the Trump campaign continued to court McDonald ahead of the rules-making process for the caucus, including hosting him at his Mar-A-Lago club. The state party’s former executive director, Alida Benson, has since become the Trump campaign’s Nevada director. And in December, McDonald told a crowd at a Reno Trump rally: “You come out to your location, you walk in with your neighbors, you sit with your neighbors and tell them how great it is. And then you cast your ballot for Donald Trump.” Update: Feb. 8, 2024 at 10:16 p.m. —This article was updated to include updated vote counts, as well as statements from Trump and reporting from Trump's victory party in Las Vegas.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/the-trump-train-is-a-comin-nevada-republicans-descend-on-gop-caucus-sites,True,"At 4 p.m., an hour before the Republican caucus began, the line into a caucus site at Washoe County’s Spanish Springs Elementary School in Sparks was 40 people long. Almost an hour later, the line ballooned to more than a thousand people, with more voters on the way. “The Trump train is a-comin',” voter John Sylvester II said, pointing at the sea of Donald Trump paraphernalia voters wore, from hats to T-shirts and even socks. One young person in line sported a red, white and blue striped unicorn headband. “Everything’s upside down. What used to be right is wrong,” Sylvester said about his decision to caucus for former President Trump. “I didn’t go to the primary. This is what it’s all about.” Though the lines were long and temperatures frigid, the crowd at the elementary school was in good spirits, with one caucusgoer remarking that the lines felt like Disneyland. Sylvester and other voters who spoke withThe Nevada Independentsaid that they came to caucus because they liked the in-person, community feel and the GOP caucus’ voter ID requirements. And, as many voters noted, Trump wasn’t on the state-run primary ballot. As for the other candidate on the caucus ballot, CEO and pastor Ryan Binkley? Voter John Michael, 60, summed it up with a joke: “Who is Binky?” Thursday’s vote is the second in as many days in Nevada, and comes after months of confusion — from top Republicans to rank-and-file voters — over the decision by state Republican Party leaders to hold the caucus in tandem with a nonbinding state-run primary required by state law. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was the only major candidate on the primary ballot, butlostto the protest “none of these candidates” option. Among the confused voters was Carol Ward, 81, a Carson City resident who left before she even voted. It was her first missed election, she said, since she turned 18. She toldThe Nevada Independentthat she wanted to vote for Trump — but “this has got to be the ungodliest whole thing.” At issue for Ward was the growing line and the worsening winter weather, coupled with raw confusion over the process itself. “When I got the first [caucus mailer], you couldn’t make heads or tails out of it,” Ward said. “I even went so far as to call the secretary of state, and the lady that answered the phone laughed … And I called the Republican Party, they asked me to come to work [for the caucus]. I would be embarrassed to work there right now. There’s no way.” Mike Mead, 67, another Carson City caucusgoer, had volunteered in local elections for 16 years. The 2 1/2 hours designated for the caucus would not be sufficient time for the number of people, he argued. There to support Trump, he had to arrive an hour early to get in, he said, standing in a snowstorm the whole time. “This is a mess,” Mead said. Still, he agreed with the decision to hold a caucus — he did not vote in the primary — and hoped future caucuses might run more smoothly. Mary Bowers, also from Carson City, said she too came out to support Trump — to “do the right thing for a change, to get the right person in office.” As for whether she prefers a caucus or a primary, “I truly, honestly, don’t understand the difference between the two.” “I’m here to vote, and they voted on Tuesday,” Bowers said. “The one thing I do know, why I chose the caucus, is because this is where Trump will get the delegates. This is the one that matters.” How we got here From the moment Nevada’s Republican Party announced it would forgo the state-run primary in favor of a caucus to determine how the party’s presidential delegates would be allocated, some top Republicans and many voters have questioned the decision. In an October interview, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardocalled the dueling contests“detrimental to candidates,” “confusing” and “unacceptable” — statements he stood by when heannouncedthat he would be caucusing for Trump and voting “none of these candidates” in a symbolic state-run primary. The confusion also led to a slew ofsocial media questionsabout why Trump wasn’t on the primary ballot, long waits on GOP office phone lines and unfounded conspiracy theories that certain candidates were being kept off the ballot. But the Nevada GOP moved in September to hold a caucus in tandem with a2021 state lawmandating a presidential preference primary election so long as two candidates have filed. After the party sued to block the primary, a state judge ruled last July that both contests could move forward. That primary election ended Tuesday with “none of these candidates” routing the only active major candidate, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, by more than 30 points. Fueling that result were a number of Trump voters for whom “none of these” became a stand-in for Trump. That included Clark County resident Peggy Kilian, 81, who on Tuesday called Trump’s absence from the primary ballot “ridiculous” and said she cast her primary vote for “none of these candidates.” A longtime Trump supporter, Kilian added she would be caucusing for the former president Thursday. Another Southern Nevada voter, Rudy Roybal, 43, showed up at an election site on Tuesday only to discover that Trump would not be on the ballot. He decided not to vote that day but said he would participate in the party caucus. “To me, it was pointless. I don't think it's right. Trump should be on both ballots,” Roybal said. As caucus sites opened Thursday afternoon, turnout for a race with no real competition two days after a primary election remained an open question. Caucus turnout is traditionally low — Republicans set a record caucus turnout of 75,000 in 2016. This year, there are nearly 560,000 registered active Republicans statewide according to the secretary of state’s office, of which more than 79,000 voted in Tuesday’s primary. What does the caucus actually look like? To participate in the caucus, Republican voters needed to travel to their respective precinct locations and receive a paper “Preference Poll ballot.” The state party required participants to show a government-issued ID, and allowed voters to mark a paper ballot, submit it and then leave, instead of the normal caucus process. Government-issued forms of identification are not typically required in Nevada to vote, but many Republicans, including Lombardo, have argued that voter ID requirements lead to more secure elections. Officials said the party implemented the ID requirement for the caucus because it's a popular policy and they wanted to ensure that only legal citizens voted. Opponents of the practice say it couldcreate barriersfor people who don’t have easy access to an ID or can’t afford one. Voters who attended the caucus said that the ID requirements played a significant role in why they participated in the caucus. “I think caucusing is important, number one, to cast your vote for the primary candidate that you wish,” retired law enforcement officer Roger Vind, 66, said at Washoe County’s Spanish Springs caucus site. “But the other and probably most important aspect of caucusing is voter identification … one person, one vote and verifying [the identity of the person] who is voting.” Once voters were signed in, depending on the caucus site, they were instructed to elect a precinct caucus chair, or an official who establishes a link between a party and its voters at the precinct level. Voters then handled various party-related needs, such as nominating and electing delegates to the county convention. After party business wrapped up, participants had the opportunity to caucus or debate about the two candidates on the ballot: Trump or Binkley. Once the debate ended, voters could submit secret written ballots. Ageneral agendafor the caucus on the state party website noted that all meeting attendees were encouraged to participate or observe the ballot count, which could not start before 7:30 p.m. Following the end of the ballot-counting process, officials would announce vote totals to attendees and report the totals to the county central committee, which would then report the votes to the Nevada GOP. Though the press has historically been allowed to observe the debates over candidate choices and vote counting, the state party stipulated that individual county parties could set their own policies regarding press admission, including banning the press altogether. In Southern Nevada, the Clark County GOP opted to ban members of the press from observing the caucus altogether, while the Washoe County GOP set up one site where certain members of the press could watch the process. “I will only invite journalists and reporters, I will not allow propagandists,” Washoe County GOP party Chair Bruce Parks toldThe Nevada Independentabout the decision to prohibit certain members of the press from attending. Representatives from both county parties said members of the press could speak with voters outside the caucus location. What caucus voters in Las Vegas are saying At two caucus sites in Las Vegas — Calvary Red Rock Church and Cimarron-Memorial High School — hundreds of people stood outside in winding lines on Thursday. Eight caucusgoers said in interviews that they were particularly passionate about securing the southern border and lowering costs. While some said they did not care for how Trump conducts himself, all of those interviewed described his presidency as far more successful than Biden, who they described as senile and corrupt. “We are not respected throughout the world,” said Joanne DeMarco, 63. Marcia Spew, 70, was one of hundreds of people at the Calvary Church Red Rock in Las Vegas. Wearing a “TRUMP WAS RIGHT” shirt, Spew said she had not been politically involved until the past couple of years — 2024 was her first-ever caucus. She said she believes former President Barack Obama is running the country. “Everybody knows,” Spew said. “Look at Biden. He doesn't even know he's president.” Foreign policy was a concern for Curtis Schmit, a 22-year-old UNLV student caucusing at Calvary. He criticized Biden for American involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict (Biden is a vocal proponent of giving more aid to Ukraine and Israel, both American allies). “I think Russia did the wrong thing, but at the end of the day, we need to focus on what we’re doing here,” Schmit said. Some voters acknowledged that they can be put off by Trump’s comments at times — but that didn’t hold any weight in who they would throw their votes behind. Linda Berger, 78, moved to the U.S. from London when she was 12 and called the day she became a naturalized citizen “the best day of [her] life.” Trump, Berger said, loves the country, which matters most to her. “I know that he has a lot of things to say that people don't like and find him very abrasive,” Berger said. “But my feeling is he loves this country, and the things that he does for this country benefit all of us.” Reporters Jacob Solis and Eric Neugeboren contributed to this story from Las Vegas.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-poised-for-big-win-ahead-of-nevada-gop-caucus,True,"Two days after Nikki Haley’s campaign was outvoted 2-1 in Nevada’s non-binding presidential primaryin favor of no one, Nevada Republicans will gather tonight to declare former President Donald Trump a unanimous winner in the state’s party-run caucus. It’s a race in which only Trump and Texas banking CEO and pastor Ryan Binkley are running, and one in which Trump is guaranteed to secure 26 more delegates — more delegates than he won ineither Iowa or New Hampshire— and a night’s worth of headlines on his way to the next contest in South Carolina. It comes after months of confusion for rank and file Nevada Republicans, who were confronted not only by two elections (with one mattering and the other not), but with a primary ballot that excluded Trump altogether (again, a decision by the state party to prevent candidates from filing for both). Haley, for her part,told Fox 11 in Los Angelesthat Nevada’s GOP elections were “rigged from the start.” Trump and his campaign have spent the time in between already poised in victory formation. Ina poston his Truth Social platform Tuesday, Trump said, “Watch, she’ll soon claim Victory!” after the first results showed Haley behind “None of These Candidates” by nearly 30 points. On Wednesday, a Trump campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, said in a statement that Haley’s Nevada defeat was “humiliating, embarrassing and utterly overwhelming.” Now — what will a win in Nevada be worth to Trump? Here’s what we’re watching before Republicans arrive for the caucus at 5 p.m.: Who will actually show up for a preordained caucus? This number is important because if turnout is low enough, Haley could end up with more votes from Nevada than Trump. In returns released through Wednesday afternoon, Haley has recorded more than 21,000 votes (only about 23,000 fewer than the top vote-getter, “none of these candidates”). It’s not a high bar to clear. Even in themessy 2012 GOP caucus, 33,000 voters participated. Matching that turnout would see Trump easily clear Haley’s number and avoid a potentially embarrassing result for his own campaign. Still, the structure and timing of the state party’s caucus may limit turnout. The caucus functions similarly to a primary, in which voters are able to mark their favored candidate on a secret ballot, but is only open in-person from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., disallows absentee voting in most cases and requires participants to have been a Republican since early last month. Nevada’s delegates will be allocated based on each candidate’s share of the statewide caucus vote, butneed to clear 3.9 percentto qualify for delegates (a measuring point we’ll call the “Binkley Bar”). Axiosrecently reportedthat the Trump camp was worried about a hollow victory in Nevada if he underperformed relative to Haley, though the impact of such a result has been lessened by Haley’s poor performance against “none of these candidates.” In the interim, narrative remains king. Sixteen days bridge Nevada’s caucus and the South Carolina Republican primary — described by the Trump campaign, according to theNew York Times, as Haley’s “Waterloo” (in the Napoleonic sense of the word, and not the famed ABBA song). The former president has been openly eager to dispatch his lone opponent before Super Tuesday,railing against Haleyfor staying in after her loss in New Hampshire and eyeinga more direct confrontation with Biden. Trump himself is expected to be in Las Vegas on Thursday for a victory event at the Treasure Island casino, according to theLas Vegas Review-Journal. What will we know and when will we know it? Good questions. The state party has released little information for people who aren’t Republicans planning to caucus, meaning exactly where and how results and turnout figures will be released remains up in the air as of Wednesday. More broadly, we’ll be watching for any general issues with running the caucus. Though the 2020 caucus was canceled, the Republican caucuses in2012and2016were marred by administrative issues, from counting delays to confusion about precincts. But unlike a state-run election, where reporters and regular people alike can legally observe voting under certain conditions, outside access is restricted by party rules. State party leaders have so far left access decisions up to county party chairs, creating a patchwork of who can be let in and where. In Washoe County, for instance,ProPublicareported this week that party chair Bruce Parks planned to refuse media access at every caucus site before changing to allow a limited number of reporters at a single site. When asked, Parks toldProPublica’sAnjeanette Damon: “There seems to be a shortage of honest reporters. We’re not going to open the doors and allow a particular narrative to be put out there that is not truthful.” Editor’s note: This story appears in Indy Elections,The Nevada Independent’s newsletter dedicated to comprehensive coverage of the 2024 elections.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/cortez-masto-and-rosen-vote-for-failed-border-bill-in-test-of-new-immigration-politics,True,"On Sunday night, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) released the highly anticipated text of a bipartisan national security bill unlocking aid to Ukraine in exchange for significant immigration and border reform. By Wednesday afternoon, the bill was dead. And Republicans, who have been negotiating for the type of border enforcement provisions and asylum restrictions in the package for the better part oftwodecades, were the ones that killed it. The $118 billion package would have given the Biden administration the authority to “close” the border — or cease processing most asylum claims — if the number of migrant encounters reaches a certain threshold. It would have also made asylum status more difficult to obtain and beefed up funding for the Border Patrol. But by a 49-50 vote, the Senate voted against advancing debate on the bill. The final vote included support from 45 Democrats, including Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and four Republicans. Immigration advocates said the border package represents a more right-wing approach relative to the2013 effortnegotiated by the Senate “Gang of Eight” to asylum in particular, upending decades of national precedent. Prior immigration deals traded — and fell apart — over taking a harsher tack on border enforcement in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for existing undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The package’s existence represents a new modus operandi for immigration politics reflective of each party’s leaders: one in which Democrats were quick to coalesce around a bill that restricts asylum while offering nothing for “Dreamers” brought to the country illegally as children, and Republicans were unwilling to accept such a compromise. President Joe Biden, who committed to signing the bill if it reached his desk, has taken a tough stance on immigration more reminiscent of his predecessor,saying he would“shut down the border right now.” Sens. Rosen and Cortez Masto lined up behind him. “If people are serious about protecting our security and sovereignty — of sovereign nations around the world and here — we have to get started somewhere,” Rosen said in an interview, referencing the bill’s provisions providing security assistance to Ukraine and Taiwan. But immigration advocates said the package marked a return to a Trump-era vision of the border, in which migration is discouraged and asylum isrestricted. “If a Democrat were not in the White House, Democrats would probably be in the streets, largely protesting the same exact bill,” said Michael Kagan, the director of the UNLV Immigration Clinic. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, hasrailed againstthe deal,calling ita “great gift to Democrats.” His allies in Congress — including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) — echoed similar concerns,declaring the bill“dead on arrival.” And even its supporters, such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who demanded Ukraine aid be paired with border policy changes due to the increasing anti-Ukraine sentiment in the Republican Party, recommended members vote against it. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), the delegation’s lone Nevadan, said the chilly reception from Republicans reflects a lack of trust between the parties, in which members of his party don’t trust the Biden administration to implement anything they pass and are waiting for the election. “If the border’s the biggest issue, then guess what, you'll have a new administration,” he said. “And if it's not, then maybe you won't.” What’s in the bill The border bill would have created three major changes to the way asylum claims are processed at ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border. Most dramatically, it would have created a temporary expulsion mechanism to automatically “close” the border to most asylum seekers if migrant encounters exceeded 8,500 per day. In December, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP)loggedthe highest number of monthly migrant encounters in its history — 302,000. Encounters are calculated by number rather than by person, so the figure includes repeat crossers, and does not factor whether it resulted in expulsion. However, immigration advocates say the provision to temporarily close the border only pushes migrants toward crossing at more dangerous spots, further imperiling their safety. Kagan said the provision was tantamount to closing the asylum system — a “radical departure” from the way the U.S. has handled asylum seekers since the days of the Reagan administration. Elizabeth Velazquez, a community organizer with left-leaning immigant advocacy group Make the Road Nevada who crossed the border in 2018 with her three children as an asylum seeker, said she feared that raising the credible fear standard — the legal threshold of fear of torture or persecution if they return to their countries that migrants must meet — and turning asylum seekers away at the border would imperil migrants such as herself. She said whether or not official ports of entry are open, migrants will seek ways to enter the United States because the alternative is less safe than a risky crossing. “The reason why I ran from my native [Guatemala] was because the gangs were trying to kill my children as well as myself,” she said through a translator. “So if we need to go ahead and march and fight and protest and do any of that, we will do it.” Kagan said he worried about the possibility of the U.S. closing its doors to refugees seeking asylum after a humanitarian or political crisis if the border becomes overwhelmed. “The U.S. Congress cannot just decree fewer people should come,” Kagan said. “What the U.S. Congress has some say over is how we process them after they arrive. Simply sending them back without even asking ‘Are you in danger?’ does not make the border less chaotic. It just makes it more dangerous for people in danger.” Even though the bill would have allowed for 1,400 asylum seekers to be processed per day under the emergency authority, Kagan said the level of bureaucratic adaptation required to adjust to a new standard presents a challenge, even with the funding the bill would give agencies to hire additional personnel. But lawmakers said funding for those agencies would help restore order to the asylum system. “It's good policy when everybody can come together to secure more funding to address the challenges that we see at the border now, with a large number of immigrants coming to the border, and updating an old asylum system that needs to address the needs of today,” Cortez Masto said. Additionally, the bill would raise the credible fear standard for asylum seekers, likely increasing the number of migrants who would be turned away, and aims to speed up the way asylum claims are processed by giving jurisdiction to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rather than backlogged immigration courts. On the other side of the ledger, the bill wouldprovide work authorizationfor migrants who have successfully claimed asylum and family members of certain visa holders and would increase the number of legal immigration visas issued per year by 50,000 — changes both well-received by immigration advocates. It would also provide resources for agencies to target the fentanyl supply chain — a key priority for Rosen and Cortez Masto. The inclusion of work authorization was key for Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV). “What I hear… is they want to work, and they have to wait and wait and wait to ever get that permit,” she said. The bill issupportedby the American Immigration Lawyers’ Association — which Rosen and Cortez Masto touted — butrejectedby more than 150 organizations representing border communities. Kagan, however, said the bill does little for immigrants already living in Nevada, and that the new efficiency provisions for processing would largely affect new migrants. The bill also contains no protections for existing undocumented immigrants or DACA recipients, includingthousandswho are in the state. It also provides greater funding to agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that have the authority to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. “In isolation, some of the [provisions] I'm actually pretty enthusiastic about,” Kagan said. “But the problem is they're all comparatively pretty small fry relative to the complete closure of the asylum system.” The messy politics In rejecting the compromise, Republicans have created a strange new dynamic on immigration policies — Democrats are pushing for stronger border security, while Republicans argue they don’t trust Biden enough to empower him to do so. “This is what the Republicans have been asking for,” Rosen said. “Why won't they vote on it now? Because of one person … Donald Trump is telling them what to do, saying we'll fix it when I get there.” The package was opposed not just by sitting Senate Republicans, but by prospective ones as well. Nearly all of Rosen’s potential 2024 opponents, from front-runnerSam BrowntoJeff Gunter, came out against the bill. Brown hasmaintainedthat Biden and Democrats created the problem at the border, and that their interest in fixing it in 2024 is electorally opportunistic. The political dynamics now offer Democrats the opportunity to message their willingness to fund border agencies and curb the asylum system while painting Republicans — who have long made securing the border a campaign issue — as the obstacle to doing so. In speeches Tuesday,Bidenand Senate Majority Leader ChuckSchumer(D-NY) vowed to blame Trump and congressional Republicans “every day between now and November” for the border’s lack of security. Even though the bill failed, immigration advocates said the fact that Democrats were willing to restrict asylum without gaining anything meaningful for Dreamers and undocumented immigrants is disappointing. “The community, the Latinos, we have pushed — with or without being able to have the legality to vote — we've been able to move [Cortez Masto’s] candidacy,” Erika Marquez, an immigration justice organizer at Make the Road Nevada and a DACA recipient, said before the vote. “We've been able to help to get the votes for her. So, [supporting the bill] would definitely be a betrayal.” Cortez Masto and Rosen emphasized that they want to do more for Dreamers, Temporary Protected Status recipients and other groups in Nevada that are in danger of losing their immigration status. But they said the crisis at the border — and in Ukraine and elsewhere — changed the negotiating dynamics. “We will continue to fight for [them],” Rosen said. “But right in this moment, we’ve got to stop the drugs. We have to have an orderly flow. And we have to get the resources to people around the world to ultimately keep us safe everywhere.” Electoral pushback on Democrats could be muted by the bill’s quick death. Clarissa Martinez de Castro, vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative at Hispanic advocacy group UnidosUS, said polling of Latino voters in Nevada and elsewhere consistently say they prioritize long-residing undocumented immigrants and having a secure, well-managed border — but that immigration, in polling from before the border bill, did not crack voters’ top five issues. Still, Martinez de Castro said immigration could climb Hispanic voters’ priority list — a group that makes upnearly a quarterof the eligible voting population in Nevada. While she said the bill did not address Latino voters’ immigration priorities and doubts it would “score big points” with those voters, it presents an opportunity for Democrats to get more engaged in the border debate. “There's polling that shows that people say they hear more about the issue from Republicans, and from folks who are maligning that issue, than from folks who are trying to solve it,” she said. Republicans, meanwhile, will have to contend with Democratic attacks that they were willing to abandon their policy principles in order to give Trump leverage in the general election. While unwilling to consider the Senate’s bill, House Republicans’ main play on immigration has been to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas — unsuccessfully, as it failed by one vote Tuesday night. Titus previewed the campaign rhetoric House Democrats can use. She said impeachment — a tool that hasonly been used successfully onceagainst a Cabinet secretary in the 19th century — betrays Republicans’ lack of seriousness on the issue. “As far as immigration, they can't come up with a solution,” Titus said. “In order to keep beating the drum of immigration as a campaign issue, [they’ve decided] the way to do it is through the impeachment process.” Amodei, who voted for the impeachment, said both chambers are locked in a “death struggle” on immigration, in which House Republicans and Senate Democrats are trying to send one another products that they know their counterparts have no interest in. He said given the upcoming election, there’s no upside to trusting the other side to solve problems. “You’ve got eight months left to see whether the death struggle is permanent,” Amodei said. “As in four more years, or not.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-nevada-primary-without-trump-haley-loses-to-none-of-these-candidates,True,"In a Republican primary that did not feature former President Donald Trump, “none of these candidates” — a protest choice unique to Nevada — is projected to receive more votes than former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. The result shows a significant sign of weakness for the lone major GOP challenger to Trump, who is set to sweep the Nevada GOP caucus Thursday. “None of these candidates” received more than 60 percent of the vote, while Haley received roughly 33 percent, in early returns released Tuesday evening. Other well-known candidates who appeared on the primary ballot but have dropped out of the race — former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) — received 4.2 percent and 1.3 percent of the vote, respectively, while a slew of other lesser-known candidates received about 1 percent combined. Haley’s margin of defeat was especially high in populous Clark County, home to Las Vegas, where out of more than 28,000 votes reported in the first returns, she received 30.9 percent of the vote — less than half as much as the “none of these candidates” option at 62.5 percent. Under state law, if “none of these candidates” receives the most votes in an election, the next highest vote-getter is considered the winner. Voters have now chosen the “none of these candidates” six times in state history, most recently in the state’s2014 Democratic primaryfor governor. But even if Haley had won the primary, the victory would have been symbolic, as the state GOP has opted to award delegates to the party’s national convention based on the results of Thursday’s caucus. There, Trump faces just one long-shot candidate, Texas pastor and businessmanRyan Binkley, and is expected to cruise to victory. The loss represents an embarrassing result for Haley, who is struggling to keep her campaign alive as the last threat to Trump in the race for the Republican nomination. In a statement, the Haley campaign said it was “full steam ahead in South Carolina and beyond,” according toNBC News. “Even Donald Trump knows that when you play penny slots the house wins,” the statement said. “We didn’t bother to play a game rigged for Trump.” The split between the two contests comes after the Nevada GOPadopted rulesprohibiting candidates who filed for the primary from running in the caucus. In Clark County, 65-year-old Ricardo Terrazas cast his ballot for none of the candidates. He said he will caucus for Trump on Thursday but decided to participate in Tuesday’s primary to “vote against the process.” He called the primary — which is new in Nevada and came after former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolaksigned a billrequiring one in 2021 — “a waste of time and money.” Washoe County voter Russ Bream, 57, echoed that sentiment, saying he didn’t feel the candidates on the primary ballot “were acceptable.” Rudy Roybal, 43, was disappointed to learn that former President Donald Trump was not on Tuesday's ballot and said he decided not to vote. Haley ignored Nevada this election cycle, making no official visits, and instead focused on other early nominating contests. In the Iowa caucuses, she placed third behind Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and she placed second in New Hampshire (DeSantis dropped out after Iowa). She has since turned her attention to the Feb. 24 primary in South Carolina, where she was governor from 2011 to 2017. Earlier this week, Haley’s campaign manager said the campaign has “not spent a dime nor an ounce of energy on Nevada,” and she accused the Nevada GOP of rigging the caucus for Trump. Haleytold reportersin New Hampshire that her campaign was only “going to focus on the states that are fair.” “Talk to the people in Nevada: They will tell you the caucuses have been sealed up, bought and paid for a long time,” she said. ”That’s the Trump train rolling through that.” Read more:Biden wins Nevada’s Democratic presidential primary in landslide vote The primary-caucus split This year’s presidential primary was Nevada’s first since 1996.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/biden-wins-nevadas-democratic-presidential-primary-in-landslide-vote,True,"President Joe Biden is cruising to an easy victory in Nevada’s Democratic presidential preference primary, winning 90 percent of the vote in early returns released Tuesday evening. That includes almost 91 percent of the vote in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and in which nearly three-quarters of Nevadans live. In Washoe County, a swing county that includes Reno, Biden won nearly 89 percent. Biden’s nearest challenger, author and self-described progressive Marianne Williamson, held a distant third with 2.5 percent. Another Biden challenger in other states, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN), was not on Nevada’s primary ballot as he entered the presidential race after the state’s filing window had already closed. Still, nearly 5.7 percent of primary voters voted for “none of these candidates.” The choice — a unique staple of Nevada elections — gave Democrats a functional protest vote in a primary that has seen unusually little attention from national campaigns as Biden and former President Donald Trump have geared themselves toward a 2020 rematch. “But this promise – the very thing that makes America, America – has never been more at risk than it is right now,” Biden said. “Donald Trump is trying to divide us, not unite us; drag us back to the past, not lead us to the future.” Read more:In Nevada primary without Trump, Haley loses to ‘none of these candidates’ Another 11 candidates with little name recognition or resources combined to receive about 1.8 percent. Ina statement, Biden thanked key voting blocs in the Nevada Democratic Party, including unions, immigrants and the middle class — while warning of a second Trump presidency. The win is the president’s second in just three days. Biden wonSouth Carolina’s primaryon Saturday with more than 96 percent of the vote, as well as a potentially unofficial contest inNew Hampshirelate last month as a write-in candidate with nearly 64 percent of the vote. That contestmay or may not count for full delegatesfollowing a dispute between New Hampshire and the Democratic National Committee overa reshuffling of the primary calendarin 2023 that sought to move South Carolina and Nevada into the first and second spots. The president’s win Tuesday secures 36 delegates — a minor tally compared to the more than1,900 delegatesBiden needs to secure the party’s nomination. But Nevada’s first-in-the-West primary is his first win in a general election battleground state, and will put more distance between Biden and long-shot challengers ahead of the next Democratic contest in Michigan on Feb. 27. The Biden campaign has made Nevada one of its top 2024 targets, with its six electoral votes expected to be critical to the eventual winner of the Electoral College. This includes making Nevada part of an early advertising blitz,staffing uplocal campaign posts anddispatching surrogateswith some regularity. The pre-primary campaign — even muted by other presidential year standards — ended with a visit from Biden himself Sunday and Monday, his first official campaign stop to the Silver State as the incumbent president. He spent much of his stump speechtargeting Trump, who did not appear on the Republican primary ballot and is expected to win every delegate in the party-run Republican caucus Thursday. The primary-caucus split This year’s presidential primary was Nevada’s first since 1996. It followed abillpassed with bipartisan support that Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak signed in 2021 that required both major political parties to hold primary elections, while also giving them the discretion to award delegates however they’d like. The primaries remain closed, however, allowing only voters registered with one of the two major parties to participate and excluding more than 637,000 registered nonpartisans — the largest single bloc of voters in Nevada. The state GOP — led by Chair Michael McDonald, who is one of the six Nevadansfacing felony forgery chargesover their efforts to subvert the 2020 election as so-called “fake electors” for Trump — decided to award the state’s delegates based on the results of a party-run caucus, which will take place on Thursday. The party also prohibited candidates from participating in both the primary and the caucus, and charged candidates $55,000 to get on the caucus ballot. Critics of the rules have argued that the system wasdesigned to favor Trump, amid lower turnout, limits on the participation of super PACs and the caucus candidate fee.

At Vegas party, Democrats cheer Biden’s win A diverse and enthusiastic crowd of mainly senior citizens and campaign workers took over Classic Jewel Lounge in downtown Las Vegas to celebrate Biden’s primary win. The victory party, hosted by state Democratic Party chair and Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-North Las Vegas), featured a speech by co-host Attorney General Aaron Ford. “The Biden-Harris ticket is a way that we continue to focus on the American family – all of us, not some of us,” Ford said. “Not the top 1 percent. Not someone who looks a certain way and is of a certain gender. All of us.” As Monroe-Moreno took the stage, attendees chanted “D-M-M, D-M-M.” “We went into this primary knowing that it wasn't really going to be a competitive race, right?” she said. “But that didn't stop us.” She said organizers still have work to do on the ground to engage voters to ensure a victory in November. Las Vegas retiree and former Clark County Democratic Party Chair Donna West, 67, toldThe Nevada Independentat the victory party that she is supporting another Biden-Harris administration mainly because they supported efforts tolower insulin costs to $35 a month. “Which is really nice when you're on a fixed income,” West said. Jerry Turner, 61, said he has always sat on the sidelines during elections while being a voter, but this year he plans to help mobilize Nevadans to get them to the polls. Turner said he is supporting the Biden-Harris campaign because he likes how their administration handled the COVID-19 pandemic, helping the country rebound economically and shepherding theBipartisan Infrastructure Act. “In spite of everything … the economy's good,” he said. Jonathan Jones, 78, said when Biden became president in 2020, he felt like he could finally exhale. “I remember back four years ago — every day it was a new crisis,” Jones said about Trump’s term. “Every day, some bombastic thing occurred and some huge amount of hyperbole came out of the White House and the Trump administration.” Update: Feb. 6, 2024 at 9:15 p.m. —This story was updated to include the latest vote counts from Clark County, as well as a statement from President Joe Biden.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/election-day-live-updates-voters-brave-wintry-weather-to-cast-nevada-primary-ballots,True,"Tuesday marks the final day voters can cast a ballot in person or send it back in the mail to weigh in on Nevada’s presidential preference primary.Nevada Independentreporters and photographers fanned out across the state to get a feel for voters’ moods and turnout on Election Day. For updates on turnout data in the presidential primaries,click here. 7:12 p.m.: Washoe County voters weigh in on their election choices The polling location at the North Valleys Library serves voters who live 20 miles outside of Reno, as well as others on the outskirts of the city. Election workers said that they had a steady stream of voters stopping in throughout  Election Day. Ramon Alaniz, 70, is a Hispanic Navy veteran who came to the voting site at 4:30 p.m. to cast a ballot for President Joe Biden. He said cable news dominates the election scene and the only way to speak out and counteract the “talking heads on TV” is through the ballot box. Alaniz said that his dad fought in World War II and was one of the lucky few who returned from D-Day alive. He said he sees echoes of that time in the spread of conspiracy theories, such as those from the alt-right QAnon movement. “The German people were complacent and allowed a very small minority, vocal and arrogant, and very militant group, to take over their country,” he said. “I don’t want to see the same thing happen to the United States.” As for whether he agrees with Biden, Alaniz said he believes Biden has a long history of being a public servant. “I don’t agree with everything [Biden] says, but I agree with about 75 percent of what he says,” Alaniz said. “That’s better than my wife. I think we agree about 65 percent of the time. So I wouldn’t say that I would want to marry Biden, but I’m happy with my wife and I’m happy with the structure and the institutions that we have.” Shortly after Alaniz voted, Russ Bream, 57, a Republican who served in the Army until 2018, voted for “none of these candidates” on the ballot. Bream said he’ll be voting in the caucus on Thursday and sees former President Donald Trump as the lesser of two evils. “I’m very disappointed in the way our country is. I didn’t serve for what we have,” Beam said. “I feel that this is not the country I signed up to give my life for.” Bream said that the concurrent state-run primary and party-run caucus processes are “confusing,” but it’s important to vote, even if you’re selecting no candidate on the ballot. As for why he selected “none of these candidates?” “I didn’t feel the candidates on the primary [ballot] were acceptable,” Beam said, noting that he didn’t agree with some of Nikki Haley’s proposals, such as verifying social media users, a stance she later retracted. —Tabitha Mueller 4:38  p.m.: All quiet in Washoe County On a frigid Tuesday in Northern Nevada, voters have been slowly trickling into Washoe County election sites, though there haven’t been significant wait times or long lines. As of 3 p.m., the county’s onlineturnout trackershows 1,942 voters have cast an in-person Election Day ballot — ​​1,049 Democrats and 893 Republicans. At UNR’s Joe Crowley Student Union as of 2 p.m., more journalists were present at a voting site than actual voters. Election workers at UNR estimated that at that time, fewer than 60 people had stopped by the site to either drop off ballots or vote in person. Workers said voters were coming by in “spurts,” creating a flurry of activity that then died down. The voting site at the Downtown Reno Library had more voters stop by, including 90-year-old Delores Harvey, who said cold and snowy weather prevented her from voting sooner. Though national media has described the Nevada primary as inconsequential and irrelevant, Harvey said she wants to vote every chance she gets. A Democrat, Harvey said she has voted for Republicans in past elections but voted for President Joe Biden this year. “It was an easy choice,” she said. “I think [Trump’s] time is over.” Harvey didn’t want to discuss any details about her voting decision this year but said she “believes people should make their own choice about certain things.” A Republican voter at the library declined to share any personal information but said they voted for Nikki Haley because of Haley’s experience as a governor and as an ambassador to the United Nations. The voter expressed concerns about the ages of other candidates. —Tabitha Mueller 1:55 p.m.: Two Vegas voters back “None of these candidates” in Republican primary At the Desert Breeze Community Center in Las Vegas, one of the more popular polling sites for Tuesday’s election, voters have been streaming in since early this morning, an election worker said. Two of those voters said they had chosen the “none of these candidates” option in the Republican primary because they were supporting former President Donald Trump, who skipped the primary to participate in Thursday’s presidential caucus. Ricardo Terrazas, 65, will be caucusing for Trump on Thursday but decided to still participate in Tuesday’s primary to “vote against the process.” He called the primary — which is new in Nevada and came after former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolaksigned a billrequiring one in 2021 — “a waste of time and money.” Terrazas originally was planning to caucus for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who dropped his bid for the presidency last month. “Nobody on there was worthy of my vote,” Terrazas said. Peggy Kilian, 81, is a longtime Trump supporter who will be caucusing for the former president on Thursday. It will be her first time participating in a caucus, and she said she had “no idea what the difference is” between a primary and caucus. The Nevada GOP set rules for the Feb. 8 caucus thatbars candidates from running in both the caucus and primary. Trump decided to run in the Nevada Republican Party’s presidential caucus, which will determine who wins delegates, instead of participating in Nevada’s state-run Republican presidential primary. “It’s ridiculous that his name is not on the ballot,” Kilian said. Not everyone interviewed at Desert Breeze Community Center participated in the Republican primary. David Greenman, 68, voted for President Joe Biden on the Democratic ballot. A Democrat for roughly the past 25 years, Greenman said Biden has shown that he is a “capable president.” He did not have concerns about Biden’s age, describing the presidency as a CEO-type role and crediting the people that Biden has surrounded himself with. “They’re all capable, and it’s not like a monarchy where he just waves a scepter like Donald Trump would like to have it,” Greenman said. – Eric Neugeboren 12 p.m.: Vegas voter wonders: Why isn’t Trump on my ballot? Intermittent showers did not stop voters from showing up at a polling location in the northwestern Las Vegas Valley, where low-lying clouds hid the mountains in the background. Some voters held their mail ballot close to their body to protect it from the rain and hurried inside the white tent in the parking lot of Thunderbird Family Sports Complex to drop it off. Others parked as close as they could to the entrance to spend as little time in the brisk air as possible. Voter Rudy Roybal, 43, appeared unbothered by the sprinkle but said he was disappointed to learn that former President Donald Trump was not on the ballot Tuesday. He said he did not vote and will reserve his vote for Thursday’scaucus put on by the Nevada GOP. “I wanted to vote for Trump and I'm gonna go to the caucus because of it. I still want to vote. I'm definitely a believer in voting, but I wouldn’t vote for any of those people there,” Roybal said about the Republican ballot, which includes former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and several obscure candidates. “To me, it was pointless. I don't think it's right. Trump should be on both ballots.” While he has not always been a Republican, Roybal said he has always held certain conservative values, including keeping federal spending under control, and is “more liberal when it comes to social issues.” — Jannelle Calderón",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-will-none-of-these-option-affect-expected-wins-for-biden-haley-in-primary,True,"Will “none of these candidates” thwart a victory by President Joe Biden? Could the unique protest choice on the ballot topple Nikki Haley? Can Democratic turnout surpass the record of 118,000 set in the 2008 caucus? As thousands of voters stream to their local polling stations and ballot drop boxes (findinformation about voting locations here) on Tuesday, those are just a few of the pending questions about theDemocratic and Republican primaries. On the Democratic side, Biden is likely to cruise to victory, after winning Saturday’s South Carolina primary with 96 percent of the vote. Still,  the “none of these candidates” option — a ballot choice that exists only in Nevada — could provide Democratic voters a way to express their apathy for Biden as the nominee. On the Republican side, Haley, a former South Carolina governor and former United Nations ambassador, is the only major candidate left in the primary. Former President Donald Trump is instead competing in the Nevada Republican Party-run caucus on Thursday — the only contest used to determine delegates. While Trump is likely to sweep the state’s delegates in a caucus contest against Texas pastor and businessmanRyan Binkley, Haley could still make headlines with a victory in the first contest — the primary. But she has made zero investment in the Silver State. In a statement released Monday, Haley’s campaign manager said the campaign has “not spent a dime nor an ounce of energy on Nevada,” criticizing the Nevada GOP as “a Trump entity” that has rigged the caucus for the former president. With top GOP officials recommending Republican voters to select “none of these candidates” in the primary — something Gov. JoeLombardo said he’d doas he planned to caucus for Trump — the protest choice could also disrupt a Haley victory. Though the “none of these candidates” option has played spoiler on a few occasions in lower-profile elections — including receiving the highest share of votes in the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial primary (30 percent) and a 1976 congressional primary (47 percent) — the highest percentage it has received in a general election presidential race is 2.56 percent in 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state by 2.42 points over Trump. Heading into Tuesday, more than 151,000 voters have already cast their ballots in the primaries — about 94,000 Democrats and 58,000 Republicans. We’ll explore some turnout numbers below, but click here for a completebreakdown of turnout data. Who actually shows up to vote in person? Very few people, it seems. In the Democratic primary, it was 14,000 people. In the Republican primary, more than 9,000 voters cast their ballots in person during the early voting period. By comparison, the past few statewide primary elections (which include myriad races, unlike these single race presidential primaries) have garnered upward of 100,000 votes during early voting, excluding 2020, which saw in-person voting hampered by the pandemic. The state’s change to a primary system — replacing the byzantine caucus system that typicallydrawsfewer voters and more enthusiastic partisans — has expanded voting access in concert with other state election laws, such as early voting and universal mail voting (more on that in a moment). But the state of play in these races appears to be playing a significant factor. Biden faces little serious competition in the primary. His most well-known opponent, self-help author Marianne Williamson,receivedjust 2 percent of the vote in the South Carolina primary over the weekend. On the Republican side, the lack of Trump on the ballot — along with his urging that voters skip out on the “meaningless” primary — has appeared to dampen voting enthusiasm. Still, GOP turnout has already surpassed that of the 2008 and 2012 caucuses, and it appears on track to surpass the 2016 record turnout of 75,000. The mail vote remains king Under a state law temporarily passed for the 2020 election and later approved permanently in 2021, all active registered voters are automatically sent a mail ballot for each election (unless they opt out). Nevadans have been slow to fully adopt the new voting method, especially given that the state has maintained vast options for in-person voting. In the 2022 midterms, Nevada had thelowest rate of mail votingof any universal vote-by-mail state. But in the primaries, voters have embraced mail. As of Monday morning, about 84 percent of the ballots cast in each primary have come via mail. Still, the 128,000 ballots cast by mail only represent 11 percent of the more than 1.1 million ballots mailed to Democratic and Republican voters this year. Election officials will continue to accept and count mail ballots received by 5 p.m. Saturday, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. So we’ll be watching how much that mail turnout number rises throughout the week. And voters, don’t forget: If you have not yet cast your ballot and didn’t receive one in the mail, you can still vote in person Tuesday using same-day voter registration. This option is not available for the caucus, but in the primaries, it means nonpartisan voters willing to change party registration can participate in either one of the partisan primaries, while other voters can change their party registration to cast a ballot in a different primary. The polls stay open until 7 p.m., and you will be able to vote as long as you are in line by then.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/amid-biden-trump-unpopularity-rfk-jr-woos-independents-at-vegas-rally,True,"Speaking to a Las Vegas crowd that included attendees who said they have become disillusioned with politics, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Sunday cast himself as the person who can bring back faith in the nation’s political system. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer who rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic because of his anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, is the latest member of his dynastic family — he is John F. Kennedy’s nephew — to enter the American political spotlight. He originally ran for president as a Democrat butswitchedto an independent bid last October and is now trying to land on the ballot in all 50 states ahead of the November general election. In a 35-minute stump speech to hundreds of people at Area 15 — a Las Vegas event space with games and restaurants — Kennedy said that he would fix the “humanitarian crisis” at the U.S.-Mexico border “immediately,” rebuild the American middle class and curtail drug production in the country, while also draining the “swamp,” which he said former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden failed to do. “The Democratic Party and the Republican Party, neither of them are saying that they are offering a change. They're all saying you better vote for my candidate because the other guy is scary and he's going to destroy the republic,” Kennedy said. “Don't you think that Americans deserve something better than the lesser of two evils?” Kennedy’s move to run as an independent has sparked fears amongDemocrats but mostly Republicans, given hispopularityamong Republican voters and the chance he could pull enough votes to swing the expectedly close election either way. ASiena College/New York Timespollfrom October found 23 percent of Nevadans supported Kennedy, 8 percentage points behind Biden and 15 behind Trump. Seven rally attendees said in interviews that Kennedy mainly appealed to them because he was not beholden to a single party. Some interviewees said they voted for both Biden and Trump in the past — the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees for president this year — but that they have lost faith in the two-party political system. “Vote the party line — I feel like that’s the main message,” said Emily Gregoire, 44, who voted for Biden four years ago but would vote for Trump if Kennedy isn’t on her ballot. So far, Kennedy has only qualified for Utah’s ballot. To land on Nevada’s ballot, he must receive and submit 10,095 signatures — 1 percent of total votes cast for all Nevada congressional candidates in 2022 — to state election officials by July 5. He did not mention Nevada in his speech and will not be on this week’s primary ballot. In December, the super PAC supporting KennedydroppedNevada as one of the states to prioritize landing on the ballot. Sunday was Kennedy’s first public appearance in the state this campaign cycle. Kennedy has repeatedly espoused misinformation around the safety of vaccines and founded a nonprofit that promoted COVID-19 vaccine conspiracies. Hehas saidthat “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” — a comment he hassince tried to walk back— claimed thatvaccines cause autismandsuggested last yearthat the virus might have been “ethnically targeted” to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people. His other policy positions include relatively mainstream Democratic positions. He supports a federal $15 minimum wage, transitioning to cleaner energy sources and reform that “will reorient police to serve, not occupy, Black communities,”according to his website. He has also stated that he supports abortion rights, and hassaid that he misspokewhen he said last year that he would support a federal abortion ban 15 weeks into a pregnancy. But he has recently gone after the Biden administration’s border policies. Hesidedwith Trump and the state of Texas in a legal dispute over the use of razor wire barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, days after the U.S. Supreme Court granted a request from the federal government to cut down the wires. Third-party candidates regularly appear on Nevada’s presidential ballots, but they have only made a dent in three elections since 1992 and only once in the past six elections. Nonpartisansmake upone-third of the Nevada electorate, the highest among any group. In 2016, Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson received more than 37,000 votes in Nevada — 3.3 percent of the total — which was more than the difference between Democrat Hillary Clinton and then-candidate Trump. Ross Perot, the founder of the Reform Party, also made serious headwinds in 1992 and his share of the electorate four years later was nearly 10 times the final margin between President Bill Clinton and Republican Bob Dole. However, the last time a third-party candidate won Nevada in a presidential electionwas in 1892, when fewer than 11,000 state residents cast ballots. Still, Kennedy’s goal isn’t to play spoiler between Trump or Biden — he toldNew York Magazinelast year that “my intention is to spoil it for both of them.” ‘The medical cartel’ Kennedy began his speech by referencing “the medical cartel,” accusing companies of intentionally making kids sick by shipping drugs to communities across the U.S.. “We have a whole generation — these kids are not supposed to be sick like this,” Kennedy said. “Republicans and Democrats, when you ask them about health care, they're arguing about whether we should have Obamacare or whether we should have single payer or whether we should have public private option,” he added. “All of those discussions are just about moving deck chairs on the Titanic.” Kennedy also continued to spread health misinformation. His beliefs on vaccines date back toat least 2005,and have been thoroughly rejected byhealth organizationsandindependent fact-checkers. At an anti-vaccine conference in November, Kennedy said he felt that he’d“come home,” but hassaid since announcing his presidential bidthat he is not anti-vax. On Sunday, Kennedy referenced a statistic that he said he heard on former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson’s podcast that 30 percent of American youth are diabetic. (The American Diabetes Associationhas reported that0.35 percent of Americans under 20 is diabetic.) He added that in his first week in office, he would tell the National Institutes of Health to take a “break” on drug production and efforts to curtail infectious diseases. Kennedy described the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border as a “catastrophe for everybody” that he would fix “immediately,” without saying how. Speaking to reporters after the event, he said he would increase the number of Border Patrol agents and asylum judges, as well as repair parts of the border wall. Kennedy briefly addressed other policy issues, voicing his support for school choice programs and military spending cuts, while also pledging to “drain the swamp” in Washington. He criticized Trump and Biden for getting bogged down by bureaucracy. He applauded Trump for his initial acceptance of hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus — whichmedical expertshaverepeatedly debunked— before government bureaucracy got in the way. He also denounced Trump’s response to the pandemic. “He said great things. He said, ‘I don’t want to do lockdowns,’” Kennedy said. “And then a week later, he ordered them.” ‘Tribalism is not good’ Anthony Zabeti, 21, said he’s always been skeptical of politicians. 2024 will be Zabeti’s first time voting in a presidential election, and he said he was drawn to Kennedy because the candidate became an independent last year. “It's horrible how we're so programmed to being left or right,” Zabeti said. “This tribalism is not good.” While not all of the interviewed attendees on Sunday said they had made up their minds on supporting Kennedy, they agreed that their interest in his candidacy was in part due to dissatisfaction with choosing again between Biden and Trump. Mike Vogle, 65, voted for Trump in 2020 and still supports him, viewing a vote for Kennedy as a vote against Biden. He said there is likely some merit to the criminal allegations against Trump, and he supported Kennedy’s stances against COVID-19 vaccines, which he said “were not tested enough.” “He seems to be honest, and he's not gonna cash in because he cashed in when he was born,” Vogle said. James Battaglia, 51, also supported Trump four years ago but said that the country needs “a new direction.” He also thinks Biden “is not coherent” enough to be president. “Both options for president right now are just a mess, and I don't like that at all,” Battaglia said. Siblings Malia and Mike Kern traveled from Arizona to see Kennedy. Malia, 16, is a staunch Kennedy supporter, while Mike, 23, wanted to hear what he had to say. Alexandre Gregoire, 40, also said he did not know too much about Kennedy, but that he wanted someone in the middle of Trump and Biden. Gregoire attended with his wife, Emily, who voted for Biden four years ago — which she said she did not regret, but believes this year is the right time to vote third-party because of voters’ disapproval of Trump and Biden. “The soil has never been more perfect to vote independent,” she said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/ahead-of-nevada-primary-biden-uses-las-vegas-rally-to-draw-contrasts-with-trump,True,"Less than two days before Nevadans head to the polls for the state’spresidential primary, President Joe Biden blasted former President Donald Trump’s rhetoric about the economy as “un-American” and touted successfully passing major legislation and making national economic improvements during his first three years in office at a campaign stop in Southern Nevada. Inside a small gymnasium at a community center in Las Vegas’ Historic Westside, Biden delivered a 30-minute speech to a crowd of about 200, largely attacking Trump and taking credit for legislative wins, while only mentioning the primary in passing. The pro-Biden crowd spent most of the speech cheering, breaking only to boo Trump or Republicans or to chant “four more years.” Long criticizedfor an economy wracked by inflation, Biden held up the economy — amid stabilizing inflation and continued jobs growth — as thestrongest of any major countryin the world. “And let me tell you something else, you know who’s noticing this?” Biden asked the crowd. “Trump.” Biden compared his likely general election opponent to Herbert Hoover, a reference to the one-termpresident, who served from 1929 to 1933,and is known for policies that exacerbated the Great Depression. He also described Trump’s commentspredicting an economic crashand hoping it occurs in 2024 as “un-American.” His visit comes a day after he recorded adominating winin the South Carolina Democratic primary, garnering more than 96 percent of the vote. In Nevada, he faces only long shot candidates and is expected to cruise to victory in the primary, continuing his path to lock up the party’s nomination. Nearly 95,000 Nevada voters havealready cast their ballotsin the Democratic primary as of Saturday morning — nearly as many as the 105,000 voters that participated in Nevada’s highly competitive presidential caucus in 2020. His primary election success has come amid a series of polls that show a divided American public. A nationalNBC Newspoll released Sunday showed Biden trailing Trump by 5 points, while another national poll fromQuinnipiac Universityshowed Biden leading by 6 points — though that lead disappears in a hypothetical election that includes third-party candidates. Themost recent Nevada pollson the general election matchup have found Trump leading by 2 points and by 8 points in a head-to-head matchup. Biden’s polls have sagged, in part, overconcerns from voters about the president’s age. Biden, who turned 81 last year, would be 86 at the end of a second term. But the Biden faithful have shrugged off such concerns. Hilary Moscowitz, 48, of Las Vegas said in an interview, “I haven’t really thought about” the president’s age and said she liked Biden for being an “everyman” president. “It's just a number to me,” she said. “If he’s doing what’s right for this country, then he’s doing what’s right for this country.” The Rev. Karen Anderson was among a small group who met with Biden to discuss local issues ahead of Sunday’s speech. She toldThe Nevada Independentthat she wasn’t sure if Black or young voters in Nevada were as excited for Biden this go around. “I've heard the disappointment, particularly among a lot of young adults who say they're not going to vote,” Anderson said. “They're more concerned about his age and his ability to do the job where they're not looking at what he has accomplished. “I think tonight shows that he has a base here,” she added. A turn toward the general election The focus of Biden’s speech on Sunday night at the Pearson Community Center, which lies in the heart of North Las Vegas in a neighborhood home toprimarily Black and Hispanic residents, reflected hiscampaign's ramp up for the general electionin a key battleground state. He described the current political situation as a “battle for the soul of our nation,” referring to Trump’s opposition to abortion and attacks on Democrat-backed election policies, as he appears set to contend with the former president in the general election. The lack of a competitive primary — and the transition away from the intensive caucus model of years past — has allowed Biden’s campaign to focus on building out a volunteer operation and testing his messaging earlier in the year,his campaign staff recently toldThe Nevada Independent. Last weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris also made acampaign stopin Nevada, forcefully criticizing Trump while at a branch of the International Brotherhood of Electoral Workers in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood in East Las Vegas. On the same day, Trump was less than 2 miles away in East Las Vegas,attacking Biden on immigrationwhile seeking to appeal to Latino voters, who make upnearly one-fifth of the electoratein Nevada. Trump is expected to lock up Nevada’s presidential delegates two days after the primary, during the Nevada Republican Party-run caucus Feb. 8. Biden on Sunday made overtures toward voters of color, highlighting thebenefits of the child tax creditfor Black, Hispanic and Indigenous families. Biden also spent much of the speech touting accomplishments from his first three years in office, including promoting a$3 billion federal investmentfor a high-speed rail line between Las Vegas and Southern California. On multiple occasions, he reminded the crowd of the stakes of other races on the ballot this November, including Sen. Jacky Rosen’s (D-NV) re-election bid, a race likely to play a major part in determining the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. Biden also said he would approve national protections for abortion access to replace the now-repealedRoe v. Wade, if Democrats control Congress, and heblamed the former president for overturning the long-standing court precedent protecting abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Those same protections still exist in Nevada law and can only be changed by a vote of the people. Biden also repeatedly tied Trump to his “MAGA friends,” a reference to the current Trump-influenced plank of the Republican Party, and raised the alarm they wouldoverturn the Affordable Care Actand pass a “multibillion-dollartax cut[for] the super wealthy,” though Trump has not publicly promised such a plan. The president skirted any talking points on immigration — the main focus of Trump’s speech in Las Vegas a week ago — amid a congressional fight over a raft of policies backed by Republican senators but opposed by Trump and GOP leadership in the House. He also largely avoided mention of U.S. foreign policy, especially as it related to the war in Gaza or continuing U.S. strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/were-used-to-starting-early-why-bidens-nevada-campaign-is-ramping-up-ahead-of-primary,True,"With incumbent President Joe Biden running against a field ofmostly unknown or perennial candidates, Nevada’s Feb. 6 presidential primary isn’t exactly coming down to the wire. But the Biden campaign has nonetheless focused on Nevada in the run-up to the primary, bookending the early voting period with visits from thevice presidentand thepresidenthimself. They staffed up in Nevada beforeArizonaandPennsylvania, announcing in December ateam of fouroperatives with in-state campaign experience. And they’ve already sent several campaign surrogates out to connect with key voter blocs, including acting Labor Secretary Julie Su to speak withAsian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI)voters and 27-year-old Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) toengage young votersat a UNLV roundtable on gun violence. But with its relatively few electoral votes, saturated Las Vegas media market and distance from the campaign’s Wilmington, Delaware headquarters, why has Nevada received outsized attention from the Biden campaign? The answer? Without a caucus to run — which requires significant money and time — and with an uncompetitive primary, Biden’s staff can focus exclusively on building out a volunteer operation and testing their messaging early into the cycle in a battleground state. The goal, campaign staff say, is to engage both volunteers and voters months ahead of when they typically think about the general election and to clarify the stakes on a number of issues they believe Biden can win on — chief among them abortion, health care and the threat they say former President Donald Trump poses to democracy. And Nevada, of course, is one ofsix true swing stateswhere the election will be decided. “We've had a lot of surrogates who are super pumped to be in the state because they know how critical it's going to be,” said Shelby Wiltz, the Nevada state director for Biden’s campaign. Despite the Nevada team’s deep in-state experience, they’ll have to contend with the factor Biden’s team is dealing with all over the country — his unpopularity. His approval polling average isbelow 40 percentnationally, and polls of the Nevada electorateroutinely findBiden losing to Trump by margins between 2 and 12 percentage points. But can campaign minds — even the best — out-organize their candidate’s unpopularity or an electorate that istired of both candidates? David Damore, a political scientist at UNLV, said the Biden campaign’s early staffing and recent rallies signal that the campaign is taking Nevada more seriously than it did in 2020, when Biden won Nevada with a nearly identical margin to 2016 candidate Hillary Clinton despite beating Clinton’s percentages in other swing states. “In 2020, I think they were caught a little flat-footed here,” Damore said. “I think they'd sort of believed the hype that this is a Democratic state. And between COVID and maybe looking to expand the board in Georgia and Arizona, they didn't plan as well for here.” Although Democrats have won the last four presidential elections in the state, the last two were won by fewer  than 3 percentage points — tracking with a decline in Democrats’ margins in Clark County. In 2012, then-President Barack Obama won the state’s population center by nearly 15 percentage points; in 2022, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-NV) margin in Clark had shrunk to about 8 percentage points. Zachary Moyle, the president of Republican consulting group Reformation Strategies who is consulting on down-ballot races in the state, said the Biden campaign hired a “crack team” — but that, in his polling experience, even the best operatives can only move races by about 2 points. “They are, without a doubt, hands down, better than the Republican operatives,” Moyle said. “That is undebatable. But it still boils back down to: Can I win with the best operative in the world if I don't get my messaging right? And the answer is no.” Democrats will also have to contend with arevitalized Republicanapparatus helmed by Gov. Joe Lombardo (R), who is trying to build a political machine — albeit outside of the Trump campaign or state party, and mainly focused on state legislative races — to contend with the well-oiled Reid Machine that has driven Democratic victories. “Republicans have upped their game here,” Damore said. “It’s outside the state party, but [it’s] something we haven't really seen much of in Nevada on the Republican side. And the Trump campaign never really left.” Former staffers on Nevada campaigns said Biden’s Nevada organization is well-versed in the state’s unique campaign terrain and diverse electorate. The team is managed by Wiltz, the chair of the Clark County Democratic Party and a veteran of Biden’s 2020 campaign and Sen. Jacky Rosen’s (D-NV) 2018 Senate race. Chelsey Wininger, who has worked on Nevada campaigns since Clinton’s 2016 election and was executive director of the Nevada Assembly Democratic Caucus in the 2020 cycle, is Wiltz’s deputy. Sean Hoey, who worked on the Beto O’Rourke campaign in Las Vegas in 2020 and came from the state party, is serving as Team Biden’s Nevada general election director. Demi Falcon, a longtime aide for Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), joined the campaign as political and coalitions director. Michael Cullen, the chief of staff for former Lt. Gov. Kate Marshall (D), and Molly Forgey, a communications operative who has worked for Nevada Democrats dating back to Sen. Harry Reid (D), are consulting on the campaign as well. “We've been here cycle after cycle, so we're used to this,” Wiltz said. “We're used to starting early. You have to in order to win here.” Jorge Neri, a Democratic consultant unaffiliated with the 2024 presidential race who served as Clinton’s state director in Nevada in 2016 and worked on Obama’s 2012 campaign in the Silver State, said he was impressed with the “high-level talent” Biden’s operation has been able to secure. “Everyone there has lived in the state, has worked multiple cycles in the state, has been on winning campaigns, has been on losing campaigns,” said Neri, who was a senior adviser on Biden’s 2020 campaign. Strategy In the past, voter registration was the chief goal for presidential campaigns — both Democratic and Republican operatives still speak with reverence about 2008, when Democrats registered 30,000 voters in 90 minutes during the caucus. But with the state havingimplementedautomatic voter registration in 2020 and passing a law to automaticallysend mail ballotsto all registered voters (unless they opt out), campaigns at this early stage are now all in on engaging the existing voter pool, given voting is now easier than ever. “Nevada, it's such a transient state,” Neri said. “So you're constantly list building and list cleaning. Whoever goes into Election Day with the best list will win.” Though registering voters, particularly young voters, is still part of the Biden campaign’s blueprint, Wiltz said that training volunteers and doing voter outreach — asking voters about their biggest concerns this cycle — are critical parts of their strategy. Neri said that without serious challenges from primary opponents, campaign operatives can ensure they have the correct information for voters already on their target lists and collect new data. The state’s presidential primary also presents an opportunity to identify and motivate volunteers. Between the surrogates, the campaign rallies and even a yard sign distribution event with former Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), Biden campaign staffers said they’re viewing the primary as somewhat of a dry run for the general election — activating volunteers to staff those events, training them on both campaign mechanics and messaging and finding their most reliable volunteers. “All of the folks that we've engaged over the past month will be the base of the super volunteers that are going to be out on weekends, registering voters, calling and talking to folks, starting to get used to putting their walking shoes back on and knocking on doors and so on,” Wiltz said. “You can expect all of those programs to start early here.” Donna West, a longtime Democratic volunteer who hosted the yard sign events with Sisolak and Newsom, said she was surprised by how many people wanted to get Biden-Harris yard signs this early in the election year — “even people who live in an HOA and can’t put them up until October!” she joked. “The polls and the approval rating and all of that [are tough], but at the end of the day, when it's time to make that choice, people are going to show up and they're going to mark their ballot for Joe Biden,” West said. Wiltz said attention on the primary creates an opportunity to build relationships with the constituencies who make up Biden’s coalition — specifically listing young people, AAPI, Hispanic and Black communities, labor, women and seniors. Once the primary is over, Wiltz said the goal will be to continue to reach voters through both in-person conversations — a marked difference from the online focus of the COVID-influlenced 2020 cycle — and digital advertising. In a state with tight margins, Wiltz said the Biden team plans to use a variety of approaches, from texting and calling to driving canvassers around different neighborhoods to hosting house parties. The visits from the candidates themselves also help to gin up enthusiasm, staffers said — and represent the national campaign organization’s focus on Nevada. Neri said the visits are no small feat. In his campaign experience, it could be challenging to convince candidates to take the time to come to Nevada when other early states and other battlegrounds are closer to Washington. “The fact that the vice president has been there twice already is huge,” Neri said. “And the president's commitment to go there when there isn't an opponent just continues to reinforce the importance of the state.” And West said the transition from the off-year to the election year has been swift. “I feel like we went from having the car in park to flooring it,” she said. “It's been a very active presidential primary period, even more so than I expected.” Moyle, however, cautioned against a focus on door-knocking and calling voters. He said to win, Democrats will have to avoid the mistakes that plagued them in 2016 — having base voters stay home because they were put off by Clinton. He said the best thing campaigns can do is ensure,like in 2020, that the party’s progressive wing is on board with Biden and that in Nevada specifically, all the Democratic interest groups, from the Culinary Union to teachers’ unions, are in alignment. But he agreed that Biden’s chances come down to how excited the base is, barring a drop in gas, food and other prices by September — not whether Biden 2020 voters will defect to Trump, but whether they choose to stay home. Despite winning the state by similar margins relative to Trump, Biden won 50 percent of votes in the state in 2020 while Clinton only won about 48 percent — and voter registration numbers between the two parties arenow a lot tighter. “It really comes down to ‘Will Democrats have the same level of enthusiasm and support they had in ‘20?’,” Moyle said. “Right now, it looks a lot more like ‘16, and in a lot of cases, it looks even better than ‘16 for Trump,” Moyle said. While the lack of a caucus saves the campaign money and time, Damore said in the past, caucuses have been a prime opportunity to energize voters at the precinct level. So, the Biden campaign will need to find other ways to generate enthusiasm — amid a backdrop in which poor consumer sentiment and Biden’s underwater approval rating present Republicans with a massive opportunity. The Trump campaign’s Nevada efforts are being led by Alida Benson, formerly the executive director of the state party. Benson did not respond to a request for comment on the Biden team’s strategy. While the Trump campaign’s efforts are focused on educating voters about the Republican Party’s Nevada caucus andensuring they turn out— Trumpwill not appear on the primary ballot, while his only viable challenger, Nikki Haley, will — Damore said their campaign operation has been active in the state for years, having been so entwined with the Nevada GOP. “This is a winnable state for the Republicans,” Damore said. “This is not something that the Democrats can take for granted.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/a-democrat-beating-biden-may-be-impossible-is-nevada-marianne-williamsons-last-chance,True,"Marianne Williamson wants Nevada to know she’s still running for president. “And Nevadans, I think, will decide whether there's enough of a base of support for me to continue,” she toldThe Nevada Independenton Saturday. At the West Charleston Library, the Democrat and prolific self-help author whose pre-campaign claim to fame was once having beenspiritual adviser to Oprah Winfreywas at her second stop of the day, a 90-minute panel discussion on dangers to democracy that was part promo for Question 3 — a ranked choice ballot measure in Nevada — and part regular stump speech. To a crowd of around two dozen, a mix of the Williamson faithful and people who didn’t know she was running (and several who did, but had long ago dismissed her candidacy), she railed against the political establishment that she said had unfairly locked her out. But while she spoke, The Associated Press called the South Carolina presidential primary race for Biden just minutes after the polls closed Saturday, with the incumbent president earning more than 96 percent of the vote. Williamson sat a distant second at just 2.1 percent, ahead of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) at 1.7 percent. Weeks earlier in New Hampshire, in a primary that counted for no delegates and for which Biden was left off the ballot — Biden won in a write-in landslide, 40 points clear of runner-up Phillips. Williamson finished a technical fourth, behind the mass of “other write-ins.” In an interview withThe Nevada Independentfollowing the event,Williamson said that media outlets claiming that Biden had “no competition” were engaged in outright lies, that a “political media industrial complex that squashes any candidates other than its chosen, as it did this year, is not good for democracy.” “You don't suppress democracy to save democracy,” she said. “So I have held on despite the rather unbelievable obstructions, blocks that have been placed in my way. Asked if Nevada was an inflection point for her campaign to continue, Williamson said: “We'll see what happens, we'll see what my heart says on Tuesday night.” Jack Anglin, 69, came to see what Williamson was about — but wasn’t “looking to find a new savior or something.” Anglin is a registered Democrat, but a proponent of the Forward Party founded by another 2020 hopeful, businessman Andrew Yang. He had come to the library that evening curious about Williamson — but was still committed to voting for Biden come November, and that it was important to avoid a third-party candidate that could split the electorate. “We're not gonna screw things up for Biden, he said. “Definitely don't want Trump back.” Williamson, 71, is either in the middle or nearing the end of her second long-shot bid for the presidency. Her 2020 effortendedwell before Nevada Democrats held their caucus. Then, Williamson cast her campaign as a rejection of the traditional party orthodoxy, a rejection of fear and anembrace of loveas a political principle that she memorably took to the debate stage in 2019. Fast forward, and now Williamson has continued to seek a niche among the Democratic Party’s disaffected fringes, looking to capture progressives unhappy with the Biden administration. Her campaign  slogans are “Smash the Machine” and “Disrupt the Corrupt,” whiletweetingPhotoshopped images of herself as Wonder Woman, the “W” turned upside down to “M.” In her speeches and in routine appearances on TikTok and videos posted to X, formerly Twitter, she has called for a Department of Peace, routinely criticizing the Biden administration as militaristic, especially amid rising tensions in the Middle East. She toldThe Nevada Independentshe was the “lone progressive in this race,” and backed “Medicare for All,” tuition-free college and technical school and what she called a “Marshall Plan” for 10 million new “social housing” units nationwide in the next decade. On top of that message, she has chafed against her treatment by the Democratic National Committee, calling the primary a “game that is impossible, a game that is rigged.” “In 2020, they were satisfied simply to make fun of me,” she said. “This time, they came after me.” In 2020, Nevada caucus-goers broke decisively for the progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) over more moderate candidates including former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttiegieg and Biden. Williamson acknowledged that her campaign “did not ignite the passions of the Bernie crowd,” and that she did not know why. Still, she cast herself as the successor to Sanders on the 2024 trail — “the lone candidate talking about the fundamental economic reform necessary to restore America's middle class.” “President Biden offers incremental change and incremental change will not keep the rabble from the gates of the Bastille,” she said. “And the rabble is closer than the establishment elite has any idea.” Williamson’s campaign has spent the last few weeks in turmoil. A staff Zoom call in which she openly contemplated ending her campaign after a disappointing result in New Hampshire was leaked online. In the aftermath, she committed to staying in the race in apost on X— butcanceled a series of campaign eventsscheduled in Nevada just days later.  (After this story was published, Williamson's campaign disputed the characterization of the Zoom call as either in turmoil or chaotic). Williamson said she canceled those events because she pivoted to a series of online events that “seemed more likely to have an effect.” In Nevada, more than 98,000 Democrats have already voted early or by mail. On Tuesday, the rest will get their say — this time voting in a primary where Phillips won’t appear after he missed the state’s filing deadline last October. But questions as to whether Williamson can capitalize on Phillips’ absence, or whether she believes her campaign can actually reach the young voters of Nevada and disaffected nonpartisans, remains unclear. “I have no idea,” she said. Update: Feb. 4, 2024 at 12:02 p.m. --This story was updated to include characterization from Williamson's campaign regarding the January volunteer Zoom call.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/as-election-year-begins-democrats-wield-financial-advantage-in-congressional-races,True,"While Nevada Republican congressional challengers are locked in tight primaries and fighting to build an edge through fundraising advantages, the state’s Democratic incumbents have continued to pack their war chests with less than a year until the 2024 election. Wednesday marked the deadline for congressional candidates to submit reports to the U.S. Federal Election Commission detailing their campaign finance activity in the fourth quarter of 2023, covering October through December. The state’s top congressional fundraiser during that period was Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), who ended 2023 with arecord$10.6 million in cash on hand as she prepares for a fierce re-election campaign likely to be among the country’s most expensive federal races. ANevada Independentanalysis of the fundraising data in the Senate race shows nearly 5,500 unique donors contributed to the four leading candidates, with about 80 percent supporting Rosen and many from California and Nevada. Though somewhat overshadowed by the presidential race, Rosen and Nevada’s three House Democrats have continued to raise money at a similar pace to the 2022 election cycle — arecord-setting midtermin Nevada for election spending. Their Republican opponents, meanwhile, have largely lagged behind on fundraising totals, failing to bring in the same level of cash in races that Republicans hope can be competitive after Democrats swept the state’s competitive congressional races in 2022. Still across the aisle, some primary battles are taking shape, including in the Senate race, where establishment-backed Republican Sam Brown outraised his closest GOP opponent by a margin of more than 8-to-1. In multiple other contests, Republican challengers are propping up their campaigns through self-funding, while trailing far behind in contributions from individual donors. Read below for takeaways from key campaign finance reports. Democrats still dominate the fundraising battle In most of the state’s competitive federal races, Nevada Democrats have taken large leads in fundraising,continuing their trendof significantly outraising opponents. The discrepancy was most apparent for Rosen, who significantly bested Republican frontrunner Sam Brown’s fourth quarter fundraising total by bringing in more than $3.2 million and lifting her cash on hand to more than $10.6 million. Brown raised $1.85 million this quarter and had $1.7 million in his account headed into 2024, while no other Senate challenger had more than $60,000 in the bank. Rosen — who had over 4,000 unique donors outside of Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue — was the beneficiary of over $1.4 million in ActBlue donations. She also received contributions from a number of PACs, including pro-choice group EMILY’s List and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), as well as interest groups in Nevada such as the League of Conservation Voters and the American Gaming Association. That strength of Democrats’ small-dollar Act Blue digital fundraising platform and interest groups apparatus carried over to Reps. Steven Horsford (D-NV) and Susie Lee (D-NV) — both of whom ended 2023 with hundreds of thousands of dollars more in cash on hand than their closest GOP challengers. The exception to Democrats’ dominance was Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), the longest-serving member of the state’s congressional delegation. She raised $237,000 this quarter and has $638,000 on hand. Titus’ haul, while an improvement on her $122,300 third quarter, is still far behind Horsford’s $600,000 quarter and Lee’s $694,000. Formerly in a safe Democratic seat, Titus’ district was redrawn and made more competitive ahead of the 2022 cycle in an attempt to shore up Horsford’s and Lee’s districts. Her fundraising still lagged her congressional neighbors — her fourth quarter 2021 haul was $273,000 — but she won her 2022 race by over 5 points. Like Lee and Horsford, Titus also benefited heavily from spending from outside groups dedicated to protecting Democrats in battleground House seats. Titus’ spending also lags Horsford’s and Lee’s. Titus only spent about $40,000 in the fourth quarter, while Horsford spent nearly $285,000 and Lee spent $239,000, primarily on campaign travel, events and consulting. GOP House contenders are leveling the field with their own money One of Titus’ GOP opponents — Flemming Larsen — is using substantial amounts of his own money to even the fundraising playing field in Congressional District 1. Larsen —a Henderson restaurateur — reported raising more than $77,000 in the fourth quarter, well above the $7,000 raised by fellow Republican hopeful Mark Robertson, who lost to Titus in 2022. But Larsen augmented that total with $400,000 in personal loans to his campaign, a sum that brings his total loans so far to $1.25 million. Most of that money is still sitting in Larsen’s $1.3 million war chest, after he only reported spending about $113,000 in the fourth quarter, primarily to a pair of consulting firms. Opposite Horsford in Congressional District 4, Republican David Flippo led the GOP primary field with nearly $407,000 raised. But nearly all of that money — $400,500 — came from donations Flippo, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, made to his own campaign. Flippo’s Republican competition, former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, brought in more than $122,000 in the fourth quarter. That included support from a handful of business interests and familiar names in GOP politics — Ahern Rentals President Don Ahern and his wife (nearly $10,000), car dealership owner Jim Marsh ($1,500) and Roger Primm, son of casino developer Gary Primm ($6,600). GOP fundraising was muddier in District 3, where top Republican recruit Heidi Kasamadropped out in early Januaryin order to defend her Las Vegas-area Assembly seat. She ended her congressional foray with $143,000 raised and $397,000 on hand. Lee’s newest high-profile GOP challenger, former state Treasurer Dan Schwartz, launched his bid after the fundraising reporting deadline but haspledged to support his campaignwith $1 million of his own funds. That amount from Schwartz, historically self-funded, would still put him well behind Lee in total cash on hand. Former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien (R-Las Vegas) led the remaining field with roughly $50,000 raised — substantially behind Kasama, but well above the $13,700 raised by her last remaining GOP rival, Drew Johnson. His campaign said Johnson loaned himself $200,000 in January, after the close of the reporting period. Brown stands atop the GOP Senate field While Brown’s fundraising still significantly lags Rosen, his campaign operation brought in more than $1.5 million more this quarter than his next closest opponent in the crowded GOP Senate primary field. Brown, a U.S. Army veteran who was severely burned while serving in Afghanistan,is backedby several national Republicans. Brown also received funding from a number of PACs affiliated with Senate Republicans — Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) among them. In total, he raised $1.85 million this quarter, including $473,000 in small-dollar donations from Republicans’ WinRed digital fundraising platform. His spending — $1.06 million this quarter — also reflects an active campaign operation with expenses for direct mail and in-state travel. However, Brown’s campaign is also nearly $600,000 in debt with obligations owed to several political consulting groups. Brown’s top primary challengers reported fundraising totals closer to amounts raised by House candidates. Former Trump-appointed Ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter raised only $215,000. Among itemized donors (those who contributed at least $200), only seven live in Nevada, with far more of his support coming from California and Texas (Gunter is a dermatologist with practices in California and Nevada). He also filed an updated version of his third quarter report that reduced his fundraising total for that period from $416,000 to $191,000 because of the removal of a $225,000 candidate loan. In a note attached to the amended report, his campaign wrote that Gunter “believes the loan to be lost in the mail,” and that he “intends to send a new loan which will be reflected on future reports.” Gunter also reported spending more than he took in this quarter, leaving his campaign with just $29,000 in the bank. Nearly all of the spending went to consultants and digital services. Gunter himself has also fronted $178,000 to his campaign that it now owes him, and he owes an additional $47,000 to multiple consulting groups (about $35,000 of which his campaign isdisputing). Former assemblyman and prominent election denier Jim Marchant, who ran for secretary of state last cycle, reported raising about $160,000 in the quarter. Like Gunter, the vast majority of that money came from out of state — mostly from Florida, where Marchant is from. He spent $138,000 this quarter — almost half of which ($67,000) was spent at Mar-a-Lago, former President Donald Trump’s Florida resort, on fundraisers, including a Dec. 21 event featuring Joe Pizza, who, with his wife, contributed $6,600 to Marchant. Candidates Tony Grady and Stephanie Phillips raised about $36,000 and $11,000, respectively. Where’s the money coming from in the Senate race? Donors for Brown and Rosen came from across the country. Rosen received donations from all 50 states, with Californians and Nevadans the most likely to contribute. Her campaign saw 896 unique California donors in the reporting period (contributing nearly $530,000 total) and 650 unique donors from Nevada that together contributed more than $460,000. Twelve states had at least 100 unique donors giving to Rosen’s re-election campaign in the reporting period. Meanwhile, Brown received donations from 47 states but most of the donations were concentrated in just a few states, as only four states had more than 30 unique donors. He received money from 207 unique Nevadans — good for more than $225,000 — and 101 unique Texans, who contributed close to $90,000 total. Brown previously lived in Texas. These numbers do not include donations from popular fundraising platforms ActBlue or WinRed, and are based only on itemized donations — generally those of $200 or more. Donors for Gunter and Marchant, who posted the third and fourth highest fundraising hauls in the Senate race, were more geographically concentrated. Only seven Nevadans donated to Gunter, who had more donors in six other states. Marchant only received donations from 23 states, and nearly one-third of donors were from Florida. He received donations from six Nevadans. The super PACs are coming! Continuing a common trend in modern politics, the top races appear likely to be dominated by spending from outside groups — and not the candidates themselves. Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 decision inCitizens United v. Federal Election Commissionpaved the wayfor the rise of super PACs that can raise and spend unlimited amounts, these groups have wielded immense influence over federal elections. In 2022, outside groups spent more than $123 million in the Nevada Senate race and nearly $25 million in the Congressional District 3 race, making both contests among the most expensive races in the country, according todata from research firm OpenSecrets. A similar dynamic is already playing out in this year’s elections. Though it came after the end of the fourth quarter fundraising period, the Democratic Senate Majority PAC has planned a $36 million ad buy in Nevada to support Rosen,according toPolitico. Already the group has begun placing those television reservations through a newly created super PAC called WinSenate, which is registered to longtime Nevada Democratic operative Rebecca Lambe. Across the aisle, pro-Brown super PAC Duty First Nevada has already reported spending about $543,000 on television ads and text communications to support Brown. That’s far behind the reservations pledged to support Rosen — and evidence of her financial edge in this race — but in one of a few battleground Senate races in the country, Brown is likely to rely on support from other key Republican super PACs, such as the Senate Leadership Fund, a group aligned with McConnell, the Senate Republican Leader.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-primary-turnout-more-than-90000-votes-cast-mostly-by-mail,True,"Read more here about Joe Biden’s win in theDemocratic primary, and Nikki Haley’s second-place finish in theRepublican primaryto “none of these candidates.” THURSDAY AT 12:20 PM The Democratic presidential primary saw record high turnout, with more than 133,000 votes cast,according to datafrom the secretary of state’s office updated Thursday morning. The previous record high turnout for a Democratic presidential nominating contest was 118,000, set in the 2008 caucus when Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Barack Obama before he would go on to win the nomination and the presidency. Turnout in the Republican primary, more than 79,000 as of Thursday morning, also surpassed the previous record-high GOP caucus turnout of 75,000 set in 2016. It is far off from the GOP presidential primary record, however. In 1996, under a law that allowed for a primary in place of a caucus, Nevada Republicans participated in an all-mail presidential primary that saw more than 140,000 votes cast,more than half for Bob Dole. Though this year’s contest lacked the same level of competitiveness as some past caucuses, expanded methods of voting this cycle helped drive record turnout. That included universal mail voting — more than 1.1 million ballots were mailed to Democratic and Republican voters in the state. Though the vast majority of those ballots were not cast, mail ballots were the main driver behind record turnout, making up 80 percent of turnout in the Democratic primary and 75 percent of turnout in the Republican primary. This year’s primary also included a week of early voting, which was only previously used in the 2020 Democratic caucus. WEDNESDAY AT 12:03 PM Turnout in the Democratic and Republican primaries is approaching, but may not surpass, the record highs for past party caucuses. Turnout in the Democratic primary has surpassed 111,000 votes, according todatafrom the secretary of state’s office last updated Wednesday morning. That includes about 84,000 ballots cast by mail (76 percent), more than 14,000 in-person early votes (13 percent) and nearly 13,000 votes cast in person on Election Day (11 percent). With additional mail ballots from populous Clark County not yet reported in the latest turnout data, that number is set to rise even higher, though it may not be enough to reach the 2008 record for turnout in a Democratic caucus of 118,000. In the Republican primary, reported turnout has reached nearly 72,000 — almost at the GOP caucus record of 75,000 set in 2016, with additional mail ballots left still trickling in. The turnout in the GOP primary includes 52,000 mail ballots accepted for counting (72 percent), more than 9,000 early votes (13 percent) and more than 10,000 votes in person on Election Day (15 percent). Those totals do not include more than 1,500 mail ballots across both primaries returned but rejected for various reasons, such as a missing envelope or stray identifying marks. It also does not include the nearly 2,600 ballots needing asignature cureby the Monday, Feb. 12 deadline. It also does not include mail ballots that have not been received by election officials yet but that can still be counted. Mail ballots postmarked on or before Election Day can be counted if they are received by 5 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 10. TUESDAY AT 3:49 PM Nearly 12,000 Nevada voters have cast their ballots in person on Election Day as of 2 p.m., according to turnoutdatareleased by the secretary of state’s office. That includes more than 6,100 Democratic voters and about 5,700 Republican voters. Though the two primaries have seen similar levels of in-person turnout on Election Day, the cumulative number of ballots cast in the Democratic primary is far ahead of the Republican primary, with significantly more Democratic voters casting votes via mail and early voting. According to the latest available data from the secretary of state’s office, which was last updated Monday morning for mail ballot returns, about 100,000 votes have been cast in the Democratic primary, and about 64,000 in the Republican primary. Turnout in the Democratic primary is approaching the record of 118,000 set in the 2008 caucus, while in the Republican primary, turnout is approaching the GOP caucus record of 75,000 set in 2016. TUESDAY AT 12:58 PM As of 10 a.m. — three hours after the polls opened on Election Day — more than 2,000 voters had cast their ballots in person in the Democratic presidential primary and 1,800 in the Republican primary, according todatafrom the secretary of state’s office published after noon on Tuesday. Combined with previously reported mail and early vote turnout data, about 96,000 votes have been cast in the Democratic primary and 60,000 in the Republican primary. Those numbers will continue to rise as Election Day voting proceeds across the state, with polls open until 7 p.m. and more mail ballots likely to arrive in the coming days. Mail ballots can be accepted and counted as long as they are postmarked by Election Day and received by 5 p.m. on Saturday. In Clark County, whereturnout numbersare updated in real time, nearly 5,900 people have voted in person on Election Day as of 12:30 p.m., though those numbers are not broken down by party. In Washoe County, nearly 1,000 voters have cast ballots in person, according to county data updatedas of noon on Tuesday. That includes 531 Democratic and 462 Republican voters. The in-person voting numbers thus far pale in comparison to other recent elections, such as the 2022 June primary election, which saw more than 101,000 voters turn out in person, and the 2020 November general election, which saw Election Day turnout top 158,000. Those elections featured significantly more races, however; the presidential primaries Tuesday have been predominantly characterized by a lack of competition between candidates on the ballot. SATURDAY AT 2:30 PM After a week of early voting in Nevada’s presidential primaries ended Friday, nearly 94,000 voters have cast their ballots in the Democratic primary, compared with about 58,000 in the Republican primary, according todatafrom the secretary of state’s office updated Saturday morning. Those turnout numbers have been driven primarily by mail ballots, with about 84 percent of the ballots cast and accepted for counting in each primary coming via mail. Friday saw the highest in-person turnout of any day of the early voting period, which began Saturday, Jan. 27. Nearly 2,900 Democratic voters and more than 1,800 Republican voters cast their ballots in person Friday, the last day to do so before Election Day on Tuesday, Feb. 6. Across the full week of early voting, more than 14,000 voters cast ballots in person in the Democratic primary, with about 78 percent of those votes cast in urban Clark County. Out of more than 9,000 ballots cast in the Republican primary during early voting, less than 62 percent came from Clark County. FRIDAY AT 11:17 AM Even ahead of the final day of early voting on Friday, reported turnout in Nevada’s Democratic presidential primary has surpassed that of the 2016 Democratic caucus, reaching nearly 85,000 across mail ballots accepted for counting (87 percent of the vote) and in-person early voting (13 percent) as of Friday morning. The two contests are significantly different. Although the 2016 caucus, which saw84,000 votersparticipate, was a competitive battle between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), this year’s primary has seen President Joe Biden face only long-shot challengers, such as self-help author Marianne Williamson. The state-run primary, a first in decades, also provides voters with the ability to vote early or by mail — a change that has boosted turnout compared with past contests that typically draw only the most motivated partisans, even with less competition in this year’s contest. In the Republican primary, the absence of former President Donald Trump on the ballot has dampened turnout in comparison with the Democratic primary. About 53,000 Republican voters have cast ballots in the GOP primary, including nearly 87 percent by mail. Still, the expanded forms of voting have similarly boosted turnout compared with past GOP caucuses. Republican primary turnout has already surpassed the 2012 caucus (33,000) and 2008 caucus (44,000). THURSDAY AT 10:56 AM Through five days of early voting, Democratic turnout is steadily approaching turnout numbers reached in the past two Democratic presidential caucuses (105,000 in 2020 and 84,000 in 2016). Driven largely by mail ballots (87 percent of the vote) — which are being used for the first time in a Democratic presidential nominating contest in Nevada — nearly 75,000 ballots have been cast in the state’s Democratic primary. Thursday and Friday mark the final two days of early voting, while voters have until the close of polls on Election Day, Tuesday, Feb. 6, to submit their mail ballots. In the Republican primary, more than 48,000 voters have cast their ballots, with the vast majority, 87 percent, being mail ballots. During early voting Wednesday, more than 1,200 Republican voters and more than 1,900 Democratic voters cast ballots in person. WEDNESDAY AT 10:58 AM The latest returns from early and mail voting show that Democratic voters continue to turn out at a higher rate than Republican voters, who still are more than a week away from being able to cast their ballots for former President Donald Trump or Texas pastor and businessman Ryan Binkley in the party-run GOP caucus. Through Tuesday, nearly 68,000 Democratic voters have cast ballots that have been accepted for counting, according toturnout datafrom the secretary of state’s office updated Wednesday morning. About 60,000 of those ballots, or 89 percent, have come via mail, with only 1,900 Democrats voting in person on average each day during early voting. Fewer than 45,000 Republican voters have cast a ballot in the GOP primary, with rural voters turning out in higher numbers than urban voters. Though Republicans outside of urban Clark and Washoe counties make up just 19 percent of registered Republicans, they have accounted for more than 27 percent of the votes cast in the GOP primary. Similarly to Democratic turnout, about 89 percent of votes cast in the Republican primary have come via mail ballot. TUESDAY AT 11:40 AM More than 3,600 Nevadans turned out to vote early on Monday, a majority of whom were Democrats who continue to turn out in greater numbers than Republicans through mail and early voting. So far, nearly 60,000 Democratic voters have cast their ballots — about 90 percent of them by mail — according to thelatest data availableTuesday morning from the secretary of state’s office. Nearly 41,000 Republican voters have cast their ballot in a primary that does not include their party’s presumptive nominee, as former President Donald Trump is only running in the Feb. 8 GOP caucus. That amount does not include about 1,600 ballots from Republican voters — and more than 2,000 ballots from Democratic voters — that have been rejected for various reasons, such as stray identifying marks or a wrong envelope, or are still in need ofsignature curing. Clark County Republicans also continue to lag in turnout. Though 62 percent of registered Republican voters in Nevada are based in Clark County, they have accounted for less than 45 percent of ballots cast so far in the Republican primary. MONDAY AT 4:40 PM After two days of early voting, more than 54,000 Democrats and nearly 38,000 Republicans have cast their ballots in the state’s presidential primaries, according to data from the secretary of state’s office last updated Monday morning. While the party-run Republican caucus is still a week and a half away, nearly all voters registered with either major party have been mailed a ballot for the primaries, and most of the votes cast so far have come via mail ballots. Fewer than 4,000 Democrats and about 1,500 Republicans voted in-person this past weekend, with the vast majority of them in populous Clark County. Turnout still remains low. The returned mail ballots accepted for counting represent only about 7.5 percent of the 1.15 million ballots mailed to major party voters. Here are some other takeaways on turnout through Sunday: Voters in the state’s most populous county, home to Las Vegas and Henderson, typically make up upwards of two-thirds of the electorate in each Nevada election. But so far, only about half of ballots cast have come from Clark County. Just under a third have come from Washoe County, with the rest from rural counties. Primaries arerun differentlyfrom caucuses. In these elections, voters can use mail ballots, unlike past caucuses or the GOP caucus being held this year on Feb. 8. Democrats onlyfirst usedearly voting in a caucus in 2020. So bear that in mind when seeing any turnout comparisons to caucuses of years past. But with that, here are turnout numbers from recent caucuses. Unlike some recent past contests, including the 2020 Democratic caucus and 2016 Republican primary, this year’s presidential primaries feature less competition. In the Democratic primary, President Joe Biden faces self help author Marianne Williamson and several longshot candidates. In the Republican primary, Nikki Haley is the lone major candidate remaining on the ballot because former President Donald Trump is participating in the Feb. 8 caucus run by the Nevada GOP. Only the caucus will be used to award delegates. Reminder for anyone who received a mail ballot: Nevadans can track the status of their ballothere.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/as-primary-voting-begins-vp-harris-sets-sights-on-november-likely-trump-rematch,True,"Vice President Kamala Harris visited Las Vegas on Saturday, ostensibly to mark the first day of early voting in the presidential primary. But with both major parties’ presidential nominating contests all but decided, Harris instead focused on the general election — painting President Joe Biden’s upcoming rematch with former President Donald Trump as an existential battle for American democracy. “T​he former president has told us who he is,” Harris said. “And we must recognize the profound threat he poses to our freedoms and our democracy.” In a roughly 15-minute speech that reflected the Biden campaign’sfocus on the general election, Harris was forceful and direct in her criticism of Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination whoheld his own Las Vegas rallyfewer than two miles away on Saturday. She cast Trump as someone who doesn't care about protecting people’s freedoms and only looking out for his own self-interest. Referencing his interest in using federal law enforcement agencies toindict political opponentsand December comment that he would be a dictator “only on day one,” Harris admonished the former president as anti-freedom. “In his comments today, as always, he made clear his fight is not for the people. It is for himself,” Harris said. In speeches preceding the vice president, Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) also framed Republicans as a threat to the progress Democrats have made. “Don’t let [Republicans] sell you the same old shit and call it sugar,” Titus said. The campaign rally — held in front of hundreds at a branch of the International Brotherhood of Electoral Workers — was one of two events that Harris held Saturday. Earlier in the day and in her White House capacity, she joined Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) at a forum focused on the administration’s efforts to help small businesses. On an afternoon where Trump, from his rally in East Las Vegas where a majority of residents are Hispanic, deliberately pitched himself to Hispanic voters, Harris — noting the Latina small business owner she met at the forum — discussed the administration’s efforts to boostsmall business lendingto Latinos. While Trump’s speech focused largely on border security, Harris did not mention the topic. “President Biden and I have lowered costs, created opportunity and are building a future where every person has the security, the opportunity and the dignity that all people deserve,” Harris said. Titus and Cortez Masto also listed several accomplishments of the Biden administration, including the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,clean energy investments,lowering prescription drug costsfor seniors and bolstering funding for thehigh-speed rail projectbetween Las Vegas and Southern California. Cortez Masto and Harris dedicated significant time in their speeches to abortion, eliciting cheers from the crowd when they declared that Democrats support the right to choose. Bolstered by a crowd of enthusiastic Democrats, Harris laid out Nevada’s importance to the Biden campaign’s presidential strategy. She credited Democratic organizers for winning the state in 2020 and urged them to repeat their performance in 2024. “As the late great Harry Reid reminded us, if you can win in Nevada, you can win anywhere,” she said. “Harry, President Biden and I are going to prove you right once again.” To win, the Biden-Harris ticket will need to rely on the political machine Reid built — a machine that has outlived him on the strength of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, the powerful labor group whose famed door-knocking operation delivered Nevada to Democrats in 2020 and 2022. Long a battleground, Nevada clearly factors in the Biden campaign’s plans; Harrisvisitedthe Culinary Union earlier this month, while the president isplanning a visitin early February. Voter enthusiasm, apathy Attendees of both of Harris’ events had different enthusiasm levels about this year’s elections. Attendees said before Saturday’s rally that the election was the most important one of their lifetimes, casting Biden as a smart leader who has delivered on campaign promises, and Trump as someone who did not care about democracy and would do whatever it takes to punish his opponents. Erin Youngberg, 49, works at a Las Vegas bank and previously volunteered with former President Barack Obama’s campaigns. But since the 2012 race, she has mostly stayed away from political campaigns — until now. She admitted that she does not support all of Biden’s policies — especially his response to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict — but said the election is too important to sit on the sidelines. “I'm not going to lose democracy because I don't support 100 percent of some of the candidate’s policies,” Youngberg said. Brittany Bowling, 40, said she was skeptical of a Biden presidency four years ago, but today she is as strong of a Biden supporter as she has ever been. “I was surprised to get as excited as I am about Biden,” Bowling said. “I didn't think he would be as progressive in the way of women’s rights and numerous different things.” However, at Harris’ small business event, where she met with youth participating in the Chef Jeff Project —  a North Las Vegas program focused on helping disadvantaged people overcome barriers — some of the young people were generally apathetic about modern politics. Kam Winslow, 25, a culinary assistant at the Chef Jeff Project, said he often steers clear of politics and thought elected officials could do more to engage and support young people. “I wouldn’t say I’m engaged — like at all,” Winslow said about politics. Anya, 19, who only shared her first name, said she will not vote this election cycle, adding that there needs to be more youth outreach. “I feel like [leaders] should put more support behind programs that are already here,” she said, “because there are a lot [of opportunities] that nobody knows about.” The apathy reflects a challenge that Biden and Harris must confront this election cycle. AHarvard Institute of Politics surveyfrom last month found that just 49 percent of people aged 18-29 definitely plan to vote in the 2024 election, down from 57 percent in the same survey four years ago. Young votershelped carryBiden to victory in 2020. Devin Womack, 18, was the only young person interviewed at Harris’ official event who was enthusiastic about this year’s election. He said he is particularly passionate about ending the Israel-Palestine conflict, combating global warming and upholding democracy. “The only thing that is going to keep us together as a country is our ability to vote and advocate for the things we believe in,” he said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-east-las-vegas-trump-rails-against-biden-on-immigration-courts-hispanic-voters,True,"Just 12 days before Donald Trump is set to cruise to victory in the Nevada Republican presidential caucus, the former president appeared in Las Vegas for a rally that reflected his attempt to shift focus to the general election. Trump’s 75-minute speech focused heavily on immigration, attacking President Joe Biden’s border policies as extremist and overtly pitching himself to Hispanic voters — all while Vice President Kamala Harris was making official and campaign stops around Las Vegas and getting ready to host a get-out-the-vote event at a union hall less than two miles away. “The so-called border security deal Biden is gushing out and pushing out is not designed to stop illegal immigration. It's designed to continue the invasion of America while sending billions of dollars to Ukraine and other countries,” Trump said,continuing effortsto blow up a bipartisan deal that could grant Biden’s administration the authority toshut down the borderif a certain number of border encounters happen in a day. Trump also pledged toamp up his effortsto repel and expel immigrants from the country if elected this year, saying “within moments of my inauguration, we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation.” Though thousands filled an intramural soccer field-turned-stage in East Las Vegas Saturday, many among the crowd of fervent supporters — still largely white in a neighborhood wheremore than half of residentsare Hispanic — came from far and wide, creating a sea of red “Make America Great Again” hats in the audience. The park where Trump spoke was in aprecinctwhere nearly 74 percent of voters voted for Biden in 2020. Nevada’s Latinos have formed akey voting blocfor each party, as Democrats try to shore upsupport from their traditional basein the battleground state and as Republicans pitch the party to a group of voters who have slowlydrifted awayfrom the Democratic Party in recent years. But as Republicans in Texas and Florida have seized on Latinos as a new key constituency, Hispanic voters in Nevada have still largely continued toback Democrats. Jesus Marquez, a Las Vegas-based political consultant and Trump surrogate, toldThe Nevada Independenton Saturday that incremental gains — winninga third of Hispanic voters in 2020— were gains nonetheless. “That's still much better than what Mitt Romney did,” Marquez said. Romneywon 25 percentof the Hispanic vote in Nevada. Trump said during his speech that “we're doing better now” than Democrats “with the Hispanic vote” — a reference torecent pollsshowing him outperforming Biden among those voters despite Biden’s strength with Latino voters in 2020 — while describing unauthorized immigration as detrimental specifically to Hispanic and African American citizens. He also accused the Biden administration of persecuting Catholics, a religion that includesa plurality of U.S. Latinosand Bidenhimself. “Did you see the poll today? I'm leading in the Hispanic community,” he said. “It’s the first time in the history of the poll, this particular one, where a Republican is leading with Hispanics.” The dueling visits are evidence of Trump’s apparent collision course with Biden, as the two are on track to once again be their party’s nominees. During his speech, Trump repeated attacks on Biden on key motivating issues for his GOP base, including immigration and border security, as the Democratic National Committee looked toattack Trump on abortion, a keyissuefor Democratic voters, by flying a plane banner over Las Vegas that read “Donald Trump: Ban Abortion, Punish Women.” Though Trump still faces one other major challenger in former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, she is running in the state’s primary, not the party-run caucus, in which Trump will face Texas pastor and banking CEORyan Binkleyas the two competing in the only contest used to allocate delegates for the Republican National Convention. Trump opponents have sharply criticized the dueling primary and caucus — former operatives for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the caucus“rigged”last year, while Haleytold reportersin New Hampshire this week that she would skirt Nevada to focus on “states that are fair.” But in Nevada, where Trump has never won the popular vote and where few Republicans have won statewide races since 2014, the state’s remaining GOP establishment has all fallen in behind Trump. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardoendorsed Trump last week, tellingThe Nevada Independenthe would caucus for the former president and vote “none of the above” in the primary — a rejection of Haley’s candidacy in all but name. Lombardo was not at Saturday’s rally, though Republican Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony made an appearance, telling the crowd the pair were seeking to “make Nevada great again.” Other Trump allies in Nevada have also intensified their criticism of Haley, who has pledged to continue battling Trump’s campaign in South Carolina ahead of that state’s GOP primary on Feb. 24. OnX, formerly Twitter, Sigal Chattah — a national GOP committeewoman representing Nevada who was among the pre-Trump speakers Saturday — called Haley a “recalcitrant obstructionist” who needed to “switch teams.” Trump, speaking Saturday, said Haley’s New Hampshire support came from non-Republicans, and warned Nevadans against “wasting your time” on the state-run primary. Trump added that Haley has avoided Nevada because of her lack of support in the Silver State. “She didn't come to Nevada because they looked at the polls. I was at 97 percent. She said, ‘I think we're not going to win Nevada,’” he said, thoughno public pollshave shown such figures. Harris, meanwhile, was in Southern Nevada to drum up support for the Biden-Harris ticket on the first day of early voting for the state’s presidential primaries. Find a list of primary voting locations by countyhere. To learn more about the primaries and caucus, readhere. Trump’s planned rally also came just one day after a New Yorkjury ruledthat Trump must pay journalist and author E. Jean Carroll more than $83 million in damages for defamation. He hadpreviouslybeen found liable for defaming Carroll by mocking her allegation that he'd sexually abused her. He only vaguely referenced the decision, saying ""look at yesterday, look at all this crap going on.” Immigration takes center stage As anaccelerating disputebetween Texas’ Republican governor and the Biden administration has put a spotlight on border issues, Trump spent much of his speech telling freewheeling stories about his negotiations with Mexico during his time in office, interspersed with attacks on Biden and a border that was an “open wound.” It was a welcome stump for some of the attendees waiting in line, for whom immigration remains a key issue, despitepollingshowing that Nevadans typically rank immigrationwithin the top six. In his speech, Trump said that thousands of terrorists, rapists and criminals are “flowing in” through the southern border and pledged to send financial and military support to finish the border wall and protect it. He also focused parts of his speech on support for Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who Lombardo and other Republican governorshave backedfor Texas’ use of razor wire barriers along the border, despite the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Border Patrol agents can cut the wire. Severalmigrants have diedattempting to cross that section of the border. “It has never been worse than it is now,” Trump said. “So now Biden is trying to gaslight the American public by claiming his border disaster is Republicans' fault.” Trump added that he would implement a “catch and release in Mexico” policy. For Dorothy Caperonis, who was holding an “Asian Pacific’s for Trump” sign, growing up in San Diego near where thousands of people cross to and from Mexico every day shaped the views she has today. “We need a border wall. We need something. And it's always been like that since I was little,” Caperonis said, adding it took her Japanese mother 10 years to become naturalized. Susan Russell, a 60-year-old Las Vegas real estate agent also standing in line, added that legal immigration is not the problem. “Trump also wants a path to citizenship. And I think that's very important. There are people that have been in this country 25 years, paying taxes, contributing to society, and they need a path to citizenship,” Russell said. “And I believe that if he gets elected back into office, he's not gonna let anybody get in his way.” Russell pointed out her shirt that said, “Dictator for a day, close the border and drill.” “I just hope that the American senators stay out of his way because Trump knows what the American people want,” she said. Some argue that unauthorized immigrants divert government resources that could otherwise benefit veterans, the unhoused population and low-income families. “How are we supporting [illegal immigration] if we can't even support our homeless people — driving here we see homeless on the street — or the veterans?” said attendee Jim Cleary. “There’s people who are still waiting to be registered citizens who have been waiting years. They are more than welcome to come here and participate and join the economy and pay taxes, all those things, but they have to follow a process. It shouldn't be allowed without that.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/unions-casinos-and-utilities-power-southern-nevada-local-government-campaigns,True,"Casino companies and groups affiliated with labor unions are among the heavy-hitter donors for candidates in Southern Nevada’s local government races, including those for the mayor of Nevada’s largest city, seats on the powerful Clark County Commission and a competitive race to fill an open Las Vegas City Council seat. In most of the major council and commission seats, the incumbent is seeking re-election in 2024. And almost without fail, the incumbent outraised any challengers last calendar year. Although their candidacy does not become official until the filing period that begins March 4, candidates for local government offices have already begun fundraising and faced a Jan. 15 deadline to file campaign finance reports with the Nevada secretary of state’s office for any donations and expenditures they had in 2023. An incumbent or person seeking public office must file a campaign finance report if they have filed for candidacy or if they have received more than$100 in contributions, regardless of if they have filed for candidacy or not. Though some candidates for the Las Vegas mayor’s race have been fundraising since 2021, other local race hopefuls announced their candidacy as late as last week. This means that while some candidates have hundreds of thousands in campaign funds, others haven’t brought in enough to trigger a requirement to file a finance report. Below, see which local candidates have the funds — and which don’t — and where they got their money from: Las Vegas Mayor: Berkley, Seaman and Crear post big fundraising numbers Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman terms out in 2024 after holding the nonpartisan position since 2011, leaving the seat open and attracting a spirited competition. Former Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV) outraised other candidates last year andbrought in $1.1 million. Berkley, who had a long career in politics before losing a high-profile U.S. Senate race in 2012, has $1 million cash on hand and received a considerable amount of donations from residents in Southern California cities such as Calabasas, Encino and Beverly Hills. Berkley received 16 maximum donations of $10,000, including those from prominent political influencers and wealthy local families such as Caesars Entertainment executive Jan Jones, real estate developer and international resorts executive Stephen Cloobeck, retired judge Miriam Shearing, high-end real estate developer Beth Molasky and former Boyd Gaming executive Bob Boughner. Las Vegas City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman, a former Republican assemblywoman, raised the second-highest amount in the mayor’s race,reporting $758,000 from all contributionslast year. She headed into 2024 with $791,000 cash on hand. Seaman received donations exceeding the maximum contribution allowed from real estate investment firm Ernest A.

Clark County Commission: PACs spend big on candidates Four of the seven Clark County Commission seats, all of which are currently held by Democrats, are on the ballot this year. Commissioners Michael Naft, Marilyn Kirkpatrick and William McCurdy II are running for re-election, while Ross Miller announcedlast month that he will notseek to retain his seat. Commissioners are elected from geographic districts on apartisan basisfor staggered four-year terms. District C Republican April Becker raised more than$329,000, of which a third — $110,000 — came from 22 individual entities that are connected to the Becker family business,Becker Enterprises, a development company created by the late real estate mogul Ernie Becker. No known candidates have joined her yet in the race for Miller'sDistrict Cseat — a victory would make her the first Republican Clark County commissionersince 2008. Becker, an attorney, previously challenged Democrat Rep. Susie Lee in the Congressional District 3 race in 2022, which she lost by 4 percentage points, and state Sen. Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) in 2020, losing by just 1 percentage point. Becker also received $55,000 total in donations from political action committees (PACs), including 6PAC, 420PAC and Laborers For Solid State Leadership PAC, that are run by Tommy White, a leader for Laborers’ International Union of North AmericaLocal 872. Commissioners approve land usage anddevelopment plansand contracts, which the union and its members — who work in construction, including highways, buildings and public services — could benefit from. Becker has more than $293,000 cash on hand. District A Naft, who has been in office since 2019, raised about$1.15 millionin 2023 for his re-election campaign. Among contributors giving the maximum $10,000 donation were the Athletics Investment Group LLC (which owns and operates the Oakland Athletics), state Treasurer Zach Conine’sLet’s Get to Work Nevada PACand MGM Resorts International. Naft finished the year with nearly $1.3 million cash on hand. Naft is facing a challenge from Republican Ryan Hamilton, former director of government relations for the nonprofit Vegas Stronger, an organization that aims to reduce homelessness and address substance use disorders and mental illness. Hamilton has previously worked as a lobbyist for the Las Vegas Sands when the company was owned by GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. Hamilton, who announced his candidacy Jan. 4, did not file a campaign finance report. Updated at 2:51 p.m. on 1/30/24 to reflect that Ryan Hamilton ended employment at Vegas Stronger effective Jan. 5, 2024, and is self-employed. District B Kirkpatrick, who has yet to attract a challenger, raised$279,500last year. She first assumed office in 2015 after a lengthy tenure in the Legislature. Kirkpatrick received monetary support from several hotel and casino entities, including $10,000 each from Horseshoe, Derek Stevens Trust and Station Casinos, and $30,000 combined from MGM Resorts International, MGM Grand and Aria. Kirkpatrick also received support from 11 PACs led by, or associated with, White, totaling $30,000. The commissioner had more than $333,000 cash on hand at the end of the year. District D McCurdy was elected with 77 percent of the vote in 2020 after serving in the state Assembly. In 2023, he raised more than$297,000for his run for re-election. Donations included $10,000 from the company that owns and operates the Oakland Athletics and $30,000 total from MGM Resorts International and its casino-resorts New York New York and Excalibur. McCurdy also reported receivingticketsto the Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix valued at $10,900 — the event was categorized as educational.

Henderson City Council: Incumbents keep solid fundraising for re-election Henderson City Council members Dan Shaw, Dan Stewart and Jim Seebock are facing re-election this year. The Henderson council seats are nonpartisan, and the three incumbents do not have challengers yet. Ward II Shaw, who was appointed to the seat in June 2017, raised nearly$306,000last year. Many of his donors also supported his colleagues Stewart and Seebock. The councilman also spent nearly $20,000 to support Seebock and Stewart’s campaigns as well as Henderson Mayor Michelle Romero and Gov. Joe Lombardo. Shaw has $297,000 cash on hand. Ward I Seebock is the newest member of the council after being elected in April during aspecial election, filling the seat that was left vacant after Romero, a former councilmember, became mayor in January 2023. Last year, he raised nearly$378,000, including $15,000 combined from Republic Services through three different accounts. He has $362,000 cash on hand.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/biden-to-campaign-in-las-vegas-ahead-of-february-primary,True,"President Joe Biden will arrive in Las Vegas on Feb. 4, a Biden campaign source confirmed toThe Nevada Independenton Wednesday, in what will be his first visit to the Silver State tied explicitly to his 2024 re-election bid. Biden’s visit will be two days before the Feb. 6 primary, which he is expected to win handily, and come on the heels of Vice President Kamala Harris’ Jan. 27 visit to gin up excitement for the ticket at the onset of early voting. Nevada is the second presidential contest in which Biden’s name will appear on the ballot — he won New Hampshire on Jan. 23 as a write-in candidate after adisputebetween the state and the Democratic Party over the nominating calendar order. His visit will come just a day after the South Carolina primary — the first Democratic presidential nominating contest to award delegates — on Feb. 3. Although Nevada is the second contest, it is the first in a battleground state — one of several Biden won in 2020 that he hopes to keep in his win column as he gears up for a likely rematch against former President Donald Trump. Biden won Nevada in 2020 by just over 2 percentage points. Biden last came to Nevadain December, when he visited Las Vegas in his official capacity to tout a federal grant for a high-speed rail project connecting Southern Nevada with Southern California. He alsovisitedLas Vegas in March 2023 to discuss prescription drug reform and host a fundraiser.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/ryan-binkley-is-the-only-candidate-still-running-against-trump-in-nevadas-gop-caucus-why,True,"For months, the Nevada Republican presidential caucus has been viewed as Donald Trump’s to lose. The former president’s campaignlobbied intenselyto influence the final rules of the Feb. 8 caucus, a party-run affair that cost $55,000 for candidates to enter, and one that purposefully excluded super PACs just as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis began relying on a super PAC of his own to boost his campaign. In all, six candidates filed to run in the caucus, and seven others filed for the state-run primary, which will not award delegates. But in the three months since filing closed, the presidential primary field has collapsed, and the number of candidates appearing on Nevada’s caucus ballot has continually winnowed. All are off the ballot except for Trump — and Ryan Binkley. Binkley is a longtime Texas businessman, the president and CEO of an investment bank, Generational Group, in Richardson, Texas. He’s also a pastor, the founder — alongside wife Ellie — of the nondenominational Create Church, also in Richardson. He’s also running for the Republican nomination for president of the United States. Though he launched his campaign last April, Binkley’s quixotic long shot bid has been largely on the campaign fringe. Already having spent$8 millionof his own money to fund his campaign, he received just 0.7 percent of the vote in Iowa — 774 votes — good enough for fifth place. In a Monday statement, he touted the result as being four times as much support as former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (though it was also about 11 times fewer votes than fourth-place finisher, Vivek Ramaswamy). Speaking to reporters in New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday’s primary —easily wonby Trump — Binkley said anything north of that wouldqualify as a success. In an interview withThe Nevada IndependentTuesday, Binkley again committed to coming to Nevada to campaign ahead of next month’s caucus. In doing so, he said he wanted to ask voters what they wanted — “Do you see something missing in America?” Even as other candidateshave dropped out, Binkley has remained a nonfactor in most states. In whatfew national pollsthat have included his name, he’s received somewhere between 0 percent and 2 percent support (well within the margin of error). A Nevada poll from Jan. 5 fromEmerson Collegesplit the difference at 1 percent. With still little to no national name recognition, how does Binkley plan on beating Trump in Nevada — much less the delegate race to the Republican National Convention? “We’ve known from the beginning that this would take a series of miracles,” Binkley said. His message largely hews to GOP orthodoxy: The nation’s debt has ballooned unsustainably, the health care system has failed and the U.S.-Mexico border needs at least $30 billion for a border wall staffed by the military, National Guard and a revamped Department of Homeland Security. “We've only balanced the budget one time in 30 years,” Binkley said. “And you did not hear a Republican presidential candidate in the debate, nor President Trump himself say this, ‘I'm gonna pay back the debt.’ And so if we're not gonna pay it back, we're gonna bankrupt it.” However, pressed on a handful of Nevada-specific issues, Binkley said he was still “honing in on these issues” as he planned a pre-caucus visit next week. Pronouncing it “nuh-VAH-duh,” he demurred on whether the federal government ought to be more involved in regulating the Colorado River, as California hasclashed with other lower basin statesas lake levels in key reservoirs, including Lake Mead, have plummeted in the last few years. “I'll have to look into details about what needs to be done because there is a role for [the federal government] to play and we need to make sure that people of Nevada have access to fundamental energy and water needs,” he said. And though he backed the expansion of U.S. nuclear energy resources, he also had “no interest” in re-opening the mothballed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Opposed to abortion, Binkley said the issue should still be left to the states and said a federal ban “is not even realistic to talk about.” In a handful of ways, Binkley has also rejected the GOP mold. He lamented a minimum wage that “hasn’t changed nationally in 14 years,” though did not specify precisely how it should increase. “Now that’s not a Republican topic, but at the end of the day, shouldn’t we care?” he said. He also called for bipartisan solutions to policy problems, including immigration and the federal budget. Asked how he would accomplish those bipartisan goals in an environment where Congress has struggled to agree on anything more than short-term spending bills and where an immigration compromise has, again, been left on the ropes — Binkley said he would “have to just sit there and do what Trump did with Twitter,” telling Americans that “this is what’s causing the problem” through the lens of a camera. Binkley also frequently criticized the health care system and pharmaceutical companies. He said the Affordable Care Act was likely to collapse, to “get undone automatically,” by undoing state-by-state insurance monopolies but not necessarily requiring a repeal. He called for the U.S. to begin buying drugs from other countries to lower costs, end pharmaceutical patent extensions and did not oppose a move by Democrats to leverage Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. His path to the nomination, he argued, would be through a message of unity. He lamented that no Republican has transcended the party since Ronald Reagan, that Trump has abrogated any discussion of substantive policy issues on health care reform or the cuts to major government programs or policy aimed at helping the “working poor.” Quoting Jesus by way of Abraham Lincoln, he said the house of the U.S. divided would not stand; that, in the words of Lincoln, “if destruction or danger ever comes our way, it’s going to be from us, ourselves, within.” “The division in our country is going to continue,” Binkley said. “And that's something that President Trump is not speaking to.” As for whether voters would actually respond to that message — a handful of Nevada polls from before DeSantis’ exit showed Trump with over 70 percent support — Binkley said he had been “banging on this wall in Iowa for a long time, and it was hard for them to receive it.” New Hampshire, he said, has been “a little bit more” receptive. Nevada, he hopes, “even more so.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-oks-revised-ballot-petition-to-protect-abortion-access-in-constitution,True,"Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom announced Tuesday that a Carson City judge determined that a proposed ballot measure seeking to protect access to abortion in the state constitution meets statutory requirements and can go before voters for signature-gathering. Theproposed constitutional amendmentseeks to protect the right to an abortion until fetal viability, about 23 or 24 weeks, or as needed to protect the life or health of a pregnant patient. If the amendment qualifies and passes in subsequent elections, abortion protections would be more difficult to overturn than they are under existing state law, which protects abortion up to 24 weeks. The law wasapproved by voters in 1990and couldonly be overturnedby a majority vote of state residents. Donna Washington, a Reno pastor’s wife, initiated the legal complaint against the ballot petition, arguing the proposed amendment contained an unfunded mandate. Thejudge’s orderindicates that the petition is “legally adequate” and said that the plaintiffs did not provide any evidence that the petition would incur unfunded costs. Washington’s attorney, Jason Guinasso, said in an email that his clients were “disappointed that the District Court did not find the abortion petition deceptive and misleading,” and said they intend to appeal the decision.“Nevada voters deserve to know what the proposed Constitutional amendment is intended to do to change Nevada law protecting a women's right to abortion and how it will negate or modify existing statutes protecting the abortion rights of women in Nevada and how Nevada taxpayers will pay for their proposed change in the law,” Guinasso wrote. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s overturning ofRoe v. Wadein June 2022, efforts to restore abortion protections are taking place across the country. The goals are two-fold:increase Democratic turnoutin a presidential election year to elect abortion rights supporters and address attempts by lawmakers in red states torestrict access to abortion. Petitioners proposed the constitutional amendment after a more expansive amendment lost an initial alegal challengeand ispendingan appeal in the state Supreme Court. That amendment seeks to strengthen protections for reproductive care in a broader sense, including guaranteeing individuals the right to make decisions about “all matters relating to pregnancy,” from prenatal and postpartum care to vasectomy and abortion. A Carson City courtruledthe first proposed measure dealt with too many different issues for a single ballot measure, which bystate lawmust “embrace one subject.” Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom filed the narrower constitutional amendment almost a month after it lost the case. Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom President Lindsey Harmon, who is also the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, celebrated the ruling in a press release Tuesday, saying that it will ensure voters will have a way to establish a permanent constitutional right to abortion. Harmon said that other vital reproductive health care services are intertwined with abortion access, and the group is still waiting on the state Supreme Court to rule on the more expansive proposed constitutional amendment. “We remain confident that the Nevada Supreme Court will recognize that our initial petition meets all requirements under Nevada law and will quickly issue a favorable ruling on our pending appeal,” she said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-a-narrowing-gop-presidential-field-will-affect-nevadas-caucus-primaries,True,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis scuttled his presidential bid Sunday. He did it just six days after losing the Iowa caucus — a contest in which heoutspentformer President Donald Trump nearly two-to-one — by nearly 30 points. His exit — 18 days from the Nevada Republican caucus — now leaves just two names on that caucus ballot: Trump and long-shot Texas pastor Ryan Binkley. In what has long been viewed as a contest winnable only by Trump, the caucus is now little more than a delegate rubber stamp. Binkley, by Iowa comparison, received just0.7 percent of the vote. In a statement, Binkley toldThe Indythat his momentum was growing — he touted “receiving four times more votes than Asa Hutchinson” in Iowa — and still saw Nevada as a chance to win delegates for the national convention. But by consequence, DeSantis’ campaign collapse could further crater expected turnout, beyond low levels already expected for a caucus process famed for being obtuse for rank-and-file voters. “Why bother?” Amy Tarkanian, a former state GOP party chair, toldThe Nevada Independent.“Who are you going to debate for?” Still, the caucus is set to continue with only Trump and Binkley. State party Chair Michael McDonald said in a phone interview that he still felt “pretty good” about expected turnout, even with a whittled-down field (though he did not provide precise estimates). More than that, he said the caucus would go forward “no matter what.” “Even if everyone drops out, we’re already paid for, already moving forward,” McDonald said. Trump’s lone remaining major opponent, Nikki Haley, is running on the state’s primary ballot. It is a primary that will award no delegates and, held two full days before the caucus, will not pit the former U.N. ambassador against Trump. Haley’s strategy is intentional. Asked about the decision to snub the party-run Nevada caucus, shetold reportersin New Hampshire that “we’re going to focus on the states that are fair.” Add that to the list of long-runningintra-party gripesabout the party-run caucus. For weeks (months?) we have toyed with the once-unthinkable notion that Nevada no longer mattered to either presidential nominating contest. That has borne out in the data: an analysis from political ad tracking firmAdImpact, for instance, showed $1 million in total Nevada GOP spending compared to $75.6 million in New Hampshire. If a caucus falls in a forest, and no one is around to hear it — does it even make a sound? What is left is a race between two candidates, both running as incumbents, now coming to Nevada in a dress rehearsal for November. Trump, to his base, as the president who never left. Biden, to disaffected moderates and disgruntled Democrats, as the one man who can beat Trump. By Saturday, the general election hypothetical will be on full display. Vice PresidentKamala Harriswill open early voting festivities in East Las Vegas, just asTrump is set to rallyat an East Las Vegas baseball park, both ostensibly rallies for a pair of primary elections with neither suspense nor stakes — so long as we’re not yet counting six electoral votes.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/local-government-incumbents-seeking-re-election-in-reno-sparks-and-washoe-lead-in-fundraising,True,"In most of the major council and commission seats in the Reno-Sparks area, the incumbent is seeking re-election in 2024. And almost without fail, the incumbent outraised any challengers last calendar year. Though official candidate filings do not occur until March, candidates for local government offices have already begun fundraising. On Jan. 15, candidates who started fundraising in 2023 were required to file a campaign finance report with the secretary of state’s office to reflect donations and expenditures throughout last year. Candidates must file a campaign finance report if they have filed for candidacy or if they have received more than$100 in contributions, regardless if they have filed for candidacy or not. City councils in Northern Nevada are not partisan races, while candidates for the Washoe County Commission can run as Republicans or Democrats. Local casinos, development companies, politicians and prominent Northern Nevada residents are among the top donors to local candidates. Though some local government hopefuls have more than $100,000 going into the election, others haven’t raised enough to file a campaign finance report yet. Here’s a look at what funds candidates have going into the election and who made these funds possible: State officials donate to Reno City Council hopefuls Afterredistricting, Reno City Council has four nonpartisan seats up for election in 2024: Ward 1, 3, 5 and 6. Ward 6 has not had any high-profile candidates announce a campaign yet. Ward 1 Three people have announced their candidacy for the Ward 1 seat to represent the district that includes downtown and UNR, including incumbent Kathleen Taylor, Frank Perez and Lily Baran. Taylor — who has been the Ward 5 representative since being appointed in 2022 but now resides in Ward 1 after district boundaries were redrawn — has the most cash on hand of the three candidates, withmore than $76,000. As the Reno-Sparks region faced a2 percent increasein population from 2020 to 2022 and could seesignificant developmentin the future, real estate, construction and civil engineering companies are among the largest sources of funding for local candidates. Taylor’s largest donors — at $5,000 each — are Panatonni Development, a real estate development company; Wood Rogers Inc., a civil engineering consultant company based in Sacramento; the Dolan Trust, a trust from the Dolan family that operates various car dealerships in Reno; and the Grand Sierra Resort’s holding company. Taylor — the owner of management consulting company Taylor Made Solutions and former at-large member on the Reno Planning Commission — also has smaller donations from various local construction companies, realty groups, casinos and local politicians, including Washoe County Commissioner Clara Andriola. Perez — who recently stepped down as the chair of the Washoe County Library Board and is acode compliance officerfor the city — hasmore than $26,000on hand going into the election, with his largest donations, at $10,000 each, coming from groups associated with state lawmakers Sen. Edgar Flores (D-Las Vegas) and Assemblyman Reuben D’Silva (D-Las Vegas). According to hisLinkedIn, Perez was Flores’ attache during the 2017 and 2019 legislative sessions. He was also D’Silva’s campaign manager when the assemblymanran for Congressin 2016. Baran, a community engagement manager for Planned Parenthood, who announced her candidacy the same day as the mid-January finance report deadline, did not file a campaign finance report. Ward 3 Two candidates have thrown their hat in the ring to become the next representative of Reno Ward 3, the district that includes the Reno-Tahoe International Airport and surrounding areas. However, only Miguel Martinez — who was appointed to the Reno City Council in 2022 — has filed a campaign finance report for 2023. Martinez raised more than $65,000 in 2023 and is going into the new year withmore than $45,000in cash on hand. His largest donations, at $5,000 each, come from developer Dandini Spectrum Holdings LLC, Grand Sierra Resort’s holding company and the Dolan Trust. Similar to Perez, Martinez received donations from Flores and D’Silva but at $1,000 each. Martinez also received donations from Bonnie Weber — a former city councilwoman who also donated to Taylor’s campaign — and Taylor, as well as from Washoe County Commissioner Mariluz Garcia. Ward 5 Brian Cassidy, Devon Reese and Sheila Peuchaud are all running for the Ward 5 seat — held by Taylor until redistricting put her address in Ward 1 — which includes northwest Reno and runs to the city limits near Verdi. Only Reese — who has served on the Reno City Council since 2019 as the at-large representative, a seat that was dissolved with the ward change — submitted a campaign finance report. Reese is going into the election withmore than $140,000. Robert Fitzgerald —  the manager ofNorthern Nevada Homes, the company that built the Cottages at Comstock near UNR — is Reese’s largest donor, contributing a total of $6,000 over the course of 2023. Some of his top donors, at $5,000 each, include Panatonni Development Company, Dandini Spectrum Holdings LLC, Wood Rogers Inc., Grand Sierra Resort’s holding company and Dolan Trust. He also received $5,000 from land and real estate developers Dermody Properties, Greenstreet Development Inc. and Heinz Ranch Land Company LLC. Thesubsidiaryof Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc., which owns and operates the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa and Gold Road Motor Inn, Inc., also donated $5,000 to Reese. The Griffin Company, a local lobbying and public affairs firm, and the Reno Firefighters Association each gave $5,000 to Reese. He also received funding from state and local Democratic politicians including Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar, Attorney General Aaron Ford, Reno Councilwoman Naomi Duerr and Las Vegas City Councilman Brian Knudsen. Taylor and Martinez also donated to Reese. Sparks incumbents funded by casinos, new competitor backed by unions Sparks City Council hasthree nonpartisan seatsup for election in 2024 with each incumbent — Donald Abbott, Paul Anderson and Kristopher Dahir — running for re-election. Ward 1 Ward 1 Councilman Donald Abbott is going into the 2024 election withmore than $20,000. His top donors are the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino, the Nugget Casino and S3 Development Company LLC, a business that specializes in modern housing and business developments. Each business donated $2,500 to Abbott. Abbott also received donations from lobbyist Nick Vander Poel and 2022 Assembly District 30 Republican hopeful Ricci Rodriguez-Elkins. Taylor, Sparks Councilwoman Dian VanderWell and Sparks Mayor Ed Lawson also donated to Abbott’s campaign. Former Clark County School District Trustee Chris Garvey — who lost the Sparks mayor’s race in 2022 to Ed Lawson — does not have a campaign finance report published on the secretary of state’s website. Ward 1 is made up of the southwestern corner of Sparks where the city limits meet Reno. Ward 3 Ward 3 Councilman Paul Anderson has no high-profile opponents yet and has almost$11,000cash on hand, mostly from his own money. Before he was a city councilman, Anderson was appointed by Gov. Jim Gibbons to the Nevada Board of Agriculture after working inthe petroleum industry. Ward 3 is located at Sparks’ southeast corner and includes Outlets at Legends. Ward 5 Ward 5 Councilman Kristopher Dahir is facing Washoe County School Board Trustee Joe Rodriguez in the race for the seat, which represents the northwest area of Sparks. The incumbent has$6,000 morethan Rodriguez as of January for a total of $16,000 on hand. The Nugget Casino, the Legends Bay Casino, the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino and5 Ridges Development Co.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-to-visit-las-vegas-saturday-as-competition-in-gop-caucus-dwindles,True,"Former President Donald Trump will hold a rally in Las Vegas on Saturday, Jan. 27 — just 12 days before he’ll participate in the Nevada Republican Party caucus that will not feature any other major presidential contenders after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis exited the race Sunday. In his first visit to Nevada this year, Trump will appear at a “commit to caucus” rally at Big League Dreams Las Vegas, a sports complex that hosts Little League games in East Las Vegas. Vice President Kamala Harris announced plans over the weekendto visit East Las Vegason Saturday, which also marks the first day of early voting for the state'spresidential primary. The dueling visits mark a shifting focus to the general election, as Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden remain the overwhelming favorites to be their party’s presidential nominees. DeSantis’ decision leaves Trump and former South Carolina governor and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley as the only major candidates left in the Republican primary race. However, the two are not competing head-to-head in Nevada. In the Feb. 8 caucus, Trump will face Texas-based pastor Ryan Binkley. Haley is participating in the state-run primary, which culminates Feb. 6, and she faces several long-shot candidates. The Nevada GOP is using only the results of the caucus to allocate Nevada’s 26 delegates.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/could-biden-and-trump-drag-down-nevada-senate-contenders-heres-what-history-tells-us,True,"In 2012, Dean Heller played the presidential race exactly right. Internal campaign polling showed Heller, a Republican running for his first full Senate term, up 7 percentage points over Democratic opponent Rep. Shelley Berkley heading into the fall, with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney locked in a dead heat with President Barack Obama. But everything changed afterMother Jonespublished the now-infamous video of Romney telling donors that47 percent of Americanswould vote for Obama no matter what because of their dependence on the government and victim mentality. Heller quicklydistanced himselffrom Romney’s comments — saying he had a “very different view of the world” — but the damage was done. The campaign’s next internal poll showed Romney had fallen 7 percentage points, threatening to drag Heller down as well. So, heavoidedRomney on the trail and focused instead on split-ticket voters in Washoe County. It paid off — Hellerwonby just over a point, also benefiting from acongressional ethics inquiryinto his Democratic opponent, while Obama won by nearly 7 — making Nevada the only Obama state in 2012 to elect a Republican senator. “You see somebody like Shelley Berkley, who kept her distance from Barack Obama, and then all of a sudden, oh my gosh, Barack Obama's up, we have to bear hug him,” Heller’s then-political director Jeremy Hughes recalled in a recent interview. “Whereas Heller … ran his own race.” But six years later in 2018, it was the opposite. Heller — who once said heopposedDonald Trump “99 percent” andreturned his campaign donationsto charity — had to quickly pivot and embrace Trump,campaigning with the presidentand running on a message focused on Trump’s tax cuts and judicial appointments. Just weeks before Election Day, Heller told Trump, “everything you touch turns to gold,”at a rally in Elko, Nevada. But in a strong year for Democrats, Heller couldn’t hang on. Then-Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) beat him by 5 percentage points, riding ablue waveof anti-Trump backlash. Now running for her own re-election, Rosen finds herself in a similar position — deciding how to treat an unpopular sitting president whose path to electoral victory likely includes her state. And the Republican nominee will have to contend with the dilemma that Nevada Senate candidates have been dealing with since 2016 — how close do you align with Trump, a presidential candidate beloved by the GOP base but repeatedly rejected by the independent voters who power general election wins? Both likely nominees remain unpopular in Nevada, according torecentpolls, but with months to play out on the campaign trail, Biden and Trump appearheadedfor a rematch in 2024 — and the approach of Senate contenders on either side of the aisle is already taking shape. So far, the common choice among the GOP field is simple: embrace Trump. Even primary front-runner retired U.S. Army Capt. Sam Brownendorsed Trump last weekafter avoiding questions on the presidential race over the early period of his campaign and amid myriadattacksfrom primary rivals who said he didn’t sufficiently support the former president. On the Democratic side, Rosen is seeking re-election with a message focused on her bipartisan bonafides. Still, she’s been unafraid to appear with Biden at events — including ahigh-speed rail funding announcement— and share the stage at a Culinary Workers Unionrallywith Vice President Kamala Harris. Democrats familiar with her campaign said Rosen, unlike incumbent Democratic senators in redder Montana and Ohio, is running in a purple state — and where it makes sense to campaign with Biden, she will. The history of the president-Senate candidate relationship in the Silver State is checkered with good, bad and ugly — from the hot and cold relationship between Trump and Heller to the close bond between Obama and longtime Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). What lessons can each side take from the history of those relationships? When it all clicks The Nevada electoral outlook hasn’t changed much since 2016 —  a battleground on thepresidentialandSenatemaps and abellwetherfor the national political climate. In 2016, each of the eventual presidential nominees won in Nevada. In late February, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton narrowlywonthe Democratic caucus, and days later Trump’s landslide caucusvictoryin Nevada cemented his front-runner status. In the same cycle, Nevada’s Senate race was defined by Reid’sretirement announcementin March 2015. That set up an open, andcostly, Senate race ultimately pitting former Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, against then-Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) — a pair of candidates who took drastically different approaches to their relationship with the person at the top of the ticket. Cortez Masto — quicklybackedby Reid as his successor —endorsedClinton a week before the Nevada caucus andstuck by heramid controversy over her private email server. The two made apairofappearancesalongside each other, and throughout her campaign, she benefited from high-profile visits fromsurrogatesthat ranged from Obama-ledralliesandadsto eventsfeaturingSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and then-Vice President Biden. A source close to Cortez Masto’s 2016 campaign, who was granted anonymity to speak freely about Democratic campaign strategy, said there was a focus on consolidating Democratic support from the top of the ticket on down the ballot — a key takeaway for Democrats after the 2012 election, which saw Berkley lose the Senate race by more than a point even as Obama won the state by nearly 7 percentage points. On the Republican side, Heck, like most swing state Senate candidates,kept Trump at arm's length, endorsing but not explicitly running or appearing with Trump. But the most critical moment between Heck and Trump came just a month before the election, when, after the release of the notorious“Access Hollywood” tapethat featured Trump speaking in vulgar and sexist terms about women, Heck publiclywithdrew his supportfor Trump — a move met withboos and hecklesfrom supporters at a rally in Southern Nevada. Heck continued to muddy the waters in the following weeks, telling supporters in a closed-door fundraiser that hewanted to support Trumpand calling him “qualified” to be president. Heck ultimately received 17,000 fewer votes than Trump when both of them lost in Nevada in 2016. Meanwhile, Clinton and Cortez Masto secured victories in the Silver State with nearly identical margins — Clinton over Trump by 2.4 percentage points and Cortez Masto over Heck by 2.4 percentage points. Past Democratic alliances have proven to be similarly fruitful. Despite somefraughtmomentsin their history, Obama and Reid were oftenunitedon the campaign trail,includingin Reid’sfinal electoral victory, when heovercamelowapproval ratingsto defeat tea party favoriteSharron Anglein 2010. In contrast to the current face of each party, Obama was often a boon for Nevada Democrats. In 2008 and 2012, he recorded the two largest presidential margins of victory in the state over the past 30 years. Since leaving office in 2016, Obama has often served as one of the most popular surrogates to boost down-ballot Democrats running in Nevada, including aLas Vegas rallywith Cortez Masto and other Democrats days before the 2022 election. Some key elements of Cortez Masto’s 2016 victory remain in place heading into 2024, including the vaunted“Reid machine”that has also helped power Democratic Senate victories in 2018 and 2022. David Damore, a political science professor at UNLV, said in an interview that the ground game will become particularly important as ads and additional outside spending flood the airwaves with attacks tying Senate candidates to the presidential ones. “At some point, I think it just becomes so saturated,” he said. “And that's where I think the door-to-door, the canvassing … really makes a difference.” An unwelcome reception backfires Looking at the past decade of electoral outcomes in Nevada, the Silver State may appear more blue than purple. Even amid a spate of razor-thin victories, the last time a Republican candidate won a U.S. Senate race in Nevada was 2012. George W. Bushwas the lastRepublican presidential candidate to win the state, doing so in 2004. Though many of the recent high-profile losses by GOP candidates in Nevada have come at a time when the party has been defined by Trump, candidates who rejected Trump have suffered with the GOP base. In 2016, a strong year for Republicans nationwide, the only two Senate toss-ups they lost were Nevada andNew Hampshire— both states where the Republican candidates vocally opposed Trump. Similar to hiscriticism of Hellerfollowing the 2018 election, Trump mocked Heck for unendorsing him prior to the 2016 election,telling theNew York Times“he went down like a lead balloon.” Heck’s attitude toward Trump may prove to be a valuable lesson for Brown, who enters 2024 in a position with key similarities to Heck’s position entering 2016. Though Brown lacks Heck’s standing as a congressman, he too sits as a front-runner backed by the national party establishment facing challenges frommore conservative opponents. Hughes said the 2016 election may prove the most analogous to 2024, in that both presidential candidates are unpopular and the Senate candidates must decide how much to involve themselves with their party leaders. Hughes said the best thing the candidates can do is avoid nationalizing their race. They should show up to their party leaders’ high-profile events in the state to avoid the appearance of snubbing them, but for the most part, Rosen and Brown would do best to stay focused on Nevada. “You campaign with them when you can, but you're running your own race,” he said. Both the Rosen and Brown campaigns are already painting their prospective opponents as enablers of their unpopular leaders, a “rubber stamp” in the case of Rosen and an anti-abortion election denier for Brown. Still, Damore pointed to one recent example of a Nevada candidate finding success while navigating questions about how close to stick to Trump: Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who won a tight race in 2022 by appealing to independents, even while making several appearances atrallies alongside Trumpand offeringconflicting viewson his presidency. A senator’s distancing goes right Alongside Heller’s 2012 success, Cortez Masto’s re-election in the 2022 midterms may provide the best example for Rosen to follow. While Trump mademultiplevisitsto the Silver State in 2022 to boost Republican candidate and former Attorney General Adam Laxalt, Biden kept a comparativelylower profileon the trail,avoidingNevada. That space — along with arecordamount of cash — allowed Cortez Masto to define her own image in the campaign,overcomingRepublican efforts to tie her to Biden, while recordingendorsementsfrom some Republicans and makingvisits to deep red parts of rural Nevada. In the end, she won in thetightest Senate race in the countrywhile earning more votes in every county than Democrat Steve Sisolak did in the governor’s race. Trump-backed candidates across the country also notablyperformed poorly in 2022. “The playbook is there [for Rosen],” Damore said. But he added that winning the same type of support may be more difficult for Rosen “because she's unknown.” Since her last time appearing on a ballot in November 2018, the number of registered voters in the state has grown from fewer than 1.6 million to more than 1.9 million, with manyautomatically registeredat the DMV. That growth has included significant churn, too, with many voters leaving the state and new residents joining the rolls.The New York Timesreportedin 2022 that “almost half the voters on Nevada’s rolls have registered” since 2016, according to an analysis from Democratic data firm TargetSmart. “How many people really even know who she is?” Damore asked. A February 2023Nevada Independent/ OH Predictive Insights pollfound that 22 percent of registered voters surveyed had no opinion of or had never heard of Rosen — nearly double the amount with the same lack of opinion of Cortez Masto — though as the incumbent, she still holds a distinct name recognition advantage over any of her challengers. But being better known does not always translate to success. In his 2012 campaign, Heller had only held his Senate seat for a few months as he entered his election fight against Berkley. A former secretary of state and a Northern Nevada congressman since 2007, Heller was appointed to the Senate seat in May 2011. Berkley, meanwhile, had establisheda base in populous Clark Countyas the congresswoman representing central Las Vegas since 1999. Heller ultimatelyeked out a victoryof fewer than 12,000 votes — a win that his political advisers said came from targeting independent voters, who now make up thelargest shareof the Nevada electorate, and a relentless ground game. Both Rosen and her eventual Republican challenger will have to contend with their unpopular party leaders coming to Nevada. On the Republican side, Brown has only recently embraced Trump, but in a party dominated by the former president, his challengers are hoping their “Never Trump”attackswill stick against Brown, even as he has shown clearsupportfor the former president. Damore described Trump as a “double-edged sword,” noting that when he’s on the ballot, he brings out his highly motivated base of GOP followers. But a candidate’s decision to tie themselves more closely to Trump to win in a Republican primary may ultimately hurt them in the general election — where they’ll need to rely on moderate independents to win. For Rosen, Democratic strategists, who were granted anonymity to speak freely about campaign strategy, said whether or not she appears with Biden, voters know they’re both Democrats, but that Rosen should tout notable breaks with the president or the majority of her party to establish her record as a moderate. Critically, she has the resources to do so — a war chest of over $10 million going into 2024 and the backing of well-funded interest groups who will spend in the state. Still, on either side, the candidates may face a risk of not winning the same level of support as their counterpart on the top of the ticket. In three of the past five Nevada Senate elections, voters have elected a member of the opposite party in the state’s other major race, whether for governor or president. “We do have a fairly strong history of split outcomes in this state, so … there's some notion of voters differentiating [their choices],” Damore said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/exclusive-harris-to-visit-east-las-vegas-to-kick-off-nevada-early-voting,True,"Vice President Kamala Harris will come to East Las Vegas on Jan. 27 for the first day of early voting for the state's presidential primary, marking the Biden-Harris campaign’s first major campaign event in the battleground state in 2024. BothHarrisand President JoeBidenhave made visits to Southern Nevada in recent months  — Harris as recently as early January, to speak to the Culinary Union — in their official capacity. But Harris’ visit this January will be a campaign event, signifying the importance of the Silver State, and its diverse electorate, to their re-election ambitions. Biden for Nevada campaign manager Shelby Wiltz said in a statement that “we know Nevada will once again be a critical state for Democrats in November.” With early voting beginning Jan. 27, Nevada is the second state — behind South Carolina — in which voters will be able to vote for Biden and Harris in the primary. (Biden is not on the ballot in New Hampshire for its Jan. 23 primary because of the national party’scalendar disputewith the state.) Though Biden should cruise to victory — facing a plethora of longshot candidates, wellness guru and 2020 candidate Marianne Williamson and the “None of these candidates” optionmandated by state law— Harris’ visit is nonetheless intended to gin up enthusiasm for the incumbent. Early voting will run from Jan. 27 to Feb. 2, andElection Dayis Feb. 6. Though it only has six electoral votes, Nevada has proven to be a critical part of both parties’ electoral maps in recent elections and the site of narrow victories. Biden won the state in 2020 by just over two percentage points, a nearly identical margin to Hillary Clinton’s victory in 2016. In 2022, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-NV) Senate re-election was the closest race in the country, with the Democrat eking out a victory byless than one percentage point. With Biden’s approval rating continually underwater in Nevada — an OctoberNew York Times/ Siena College pollfound him at 36 percent approval in the state — the campaign is banking on ablitzofpaidmedia, experienced campaign staff in the state and early engagement through visits like Harris’ to keep Nevada in the Democrats’ win column.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-senate-gop-hopefuls-attack-brown-pan-rosen-land-bill,True,"Republican U.S. Senate candidates gathered in Reno Thursday night to debate who among them would be the best challenger to take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in November — and took shots at the elephant not in the room, front-runner and retired Army Capt. Sam Brown. The debate, hosted by conservative group RedMove at the Atlantis Casino, included seven candidates competing to be the Republican nominee after the June 11 primary. Both Brown and former ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter skipped out on the debate, leaving it as more of an undercard in which contenders (many of whom are perennial candidates) mostly agreed on conservative policy principles, including closing the border to new migrants, ending military aid to Ukraine and sharply curbing government spending. Real estate agent Stephanie Phillips, former assemblyman and secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant, former deputy mayor of Modesto, California Bill Conrad, retired Air Force Lt. Col. and former lieutenant governor candidate Tony Grady, lawyer Ronda Kennedy, businessman Barry Lindemann and retired doctor Fred Simon participated in a question-and-answer period about border security, the debt and abortion. Read five takeaways from the debate below: Brown, who was recruited and endorsed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and boasts endorsements fromseveral sitting senators, chose not to attend Thursday’s debate, adhering to a strategy in which he has mostly focused his fire on Rosen and largely ignored other Republicans. That didn’t sit well with his challengers, nearly all of whom attacked his support from Senate Minority LeaderMitch McConnell(R-KY) and relatively short residence in Nevada. Brown moved to Reno from Texas in 2018. “Stop giving a Texas interloper money and ad space and everything that is going to … try and mess up our election,” Lindemann said in a closing statement addressed to McConnell. “We need real Nevadans.” He took a shot at Gunter as well, saying the dermatologist, who has practices in both California and Nevada, was “probably in one of his places in California.” “It’s either kiss the ring of the establishment, the carpetbaggers, the opportunists in this race, or put your faith in the true Nevadan,” Phillips said. “I hope you remember the one that’s not here,” Kennedy said to attendees. “The one asking for your money and support, but didn’t even have enough respect to show up here and face us and answer those tough questions.” The chorus of criticism was reminiscent of issues raised by Brown himself in 2022, when he was the underdog upstart in the GOP Senate primary against the establishment-backed former Attorney General Adam Laxalt. Laxalt and Brown only had one pre-recorded debate, and BrownhammeredLaxalt for avoiding debates and being “a career politician — cowardly hiding from voters.” But Brown, who held a13-point leadover the next closest challenger, Marchant, in a November poll commissioned by the NRSC, is now pursuing a similar political calculus, at least when it comes to debating. It’s a strategy mirroring that of former President Donald Trump, who has skipped presidential debates — and whom Brownrecently endorsed. In a statement toThe Nevada Independent, Brown’s campaign said he “is the only candidate in this race with the resources, support and grassroots energy to take on Jacky Rosen.” Unsurprisingly, all seven candidates described themselves as personally against abortion. The issue has taken on massive political significance since the Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wadein 2022, advantaging Democrats, whose abortion messaging helped candidates like Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV)hang onto their seats. As Republicans all over the countrygrapple with how to message on abortion, and Nevada Democrats continually hammer Brownover the issue, most of the Republicans onstage Thursday were content to reiterate traditional Republican talking points. Marchant told a story about an anti-abortion protester standing his ground in front of a church that wanted him to move along. Lindemann suggested a standard requiring clinics that receive federal funding to show patients a sonogram. Conrad said abortion will not be as significant an issue this cycle, adding that Republicans should stand their moral ground and refer to Democrats as the “party of death.” But two candidates — Phillips and Grady — reminded voters thatNevada law, via a 1990referendum, protects abortion up to 24 weeks, and can only be undone in the state via another statewide vote. A national ban, like the oneproposedby Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), would override Nevada law. “I’m not going to tell a woman what to do with her body,” Phillips said. “That is not my place. The law is what it is.” Several candidates agreed that the challenge this cycle will be convincing voters that Democrats are scaremongering on the issue, and that contrary to Democratic messaging, abortion is not on the ballot. While the national abortion ban has not received a vote, Senate Democrats have argued that between court cases challenging the use ofabortion pills, and their efforts to codifyRoeand the right tointerstate travelfor an abortion, abortion remains relevant in Congress. At several points in the debate, Marchant, likely the best-known among the attendees for his prior statewide run and strongelection denialism, took a gold bill out of his suit jacket and encouraged attendees to purchase them. The former assemblyman, who is selling these goldbacks under a “Marchant Gold” brand at $4.20 per bill, said the currency would serve holders after the U.S. dollar collapses, an event he predicted several times. “These are the dagger in the heart of the Federal Reserve,” Marchant said during a segment on monetary policy. “Everybody needs to get these. That way you’ll be able to buy and barter … when our dollar does collapse.” Marchant advocated for a return to the gold standard, a fringe position supported byfar-rightRepublicans such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). The U.S.disallowedcreditors from demanding gold payments in 1933 and fully abandoned the gold standard in 1971. Rosen’s recently introduced Washoe County Lands Bill hasbroad buy-infrom local municipalities and conservation groups. But you wouldn’t know that from the Republican debate, in which nearly every candidate said they opposed the bill. The bill would designate nearly 16,000 acres of public land to be sold at auction to interested companies, developers or individuals, and place conservation protections on nearly 950,000 acres of public land in the county, making those areas ineligible for development. Some candidates opposed the lands bill on the grounds that it permits expansion without a water plan, while others argued against any government management of land. Only Conrad suggested the bill was a “start in the right direction.” “I don’t agree with the government coming in, controlling and managing anything,” Kennedy said. “We need to look at this land to entice businesses to come to Nevada.” While candidates were united in wanting to slash government spending and penalize people who enter the U.S. illegally, candidates had a few differences on how to handle national security priorities. Several said they wanted to cut all military assistance to Ukraine in its war against Russia, with Simon providing justification for Russia’s incursion into its neighbor based on Ukraine’s sizable Russian population and Phillips saying the war is a money laundering scheme for the Biden family. Those positions reflect an increasinganti-Ukraine attitudeamong rank-and-file Republican members of the House. In the Senate, however, Republicans are more supportive of Ukraine, though they haveinsistedit be paired with migration policy changes. Grady and Lindemann argued that the U.S. has some obligation to Ukraine, with Grady saying it revolves around the grand U.S. strategy to keep potential wars far away from its borders and that disengagement could prove damaging. “Not all Ukraine spending bills are sending money [there],” Grady said. “Some of them are replenishing our own arsenals.” But for the most part, the Senate hopefuls slammed Ukraine funding. “(Ukraine) is a money laundering, drug trafficking [scheme] set up by Obama,” Marchant said, referencing the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution in which pro-Western forces ousted a president sympathetic to Russia. “That’s how they’ve been getting all of their money to campaign against us.”",Error: Connection error.

Joe Lombardo toldThe Nevada Independenton Thursday that he plans to caucus for former President Donald Trump and will vote “none of the above” in the state-run primary. Lombardo made the comments in an 8-minute interview less than a month before Nevada’s Republican presidential primary and a separate Republican caucus two days later, saying that he planned to participate in both contests to maintain his voting record with the state, and so he could caucus for Trump. “I believe [under President Donald Trump] the economic picture was better, more predictable, more stable. And then if you look at foreign affairs, [it was] more predictable and more stable,” Lombardo said. “I think he has the ability to move us out of the doldrums associated with President [Joe] Biden.” Trump hadendorsed Lombardoin his 2022 bid for governor, giving the former Clark County sheriff a leg up ahead of the state’s Republican primary. But Lombardo had opted to stay out of the 2024 presidential race, saying multiple times in the last year that he was “not getting engaged” in the race. Asked why he was publicizing who he is voting for now, Lombardo said that for “all practical purposes … the race is over,” and out of the pool of available candidates, he believes that Trump is the best one. Though Lombardo in Septemberexpressed some hesitationin voting for Trump amidfour criminal indictments, including two in federal court, he said that since those indictments, the public has “learned a lot more” about the pending cases associated with Trump. “I feel comfortable, and my belief [is] you're innocent until proven guilty,” Lombardo said. “And I think he is well situated to be successful moving forward on that case.” Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony, a Republican, alsoissued a statementThursday endorsing Trump, saying he would caucus for the former president and vote “none of these” in the state-run primary. “I encourage all voters to do the same and take the next step to returning our great country to stability and prosperity,” he said. In October, Lombardo called the concurrent state-run primary and caucus “confusing” and “unacceptable.” He said Thursday that he stands by that statement and wishes there was just one option for voters. The Nevada Republican Partyadopted rulesprohibiting candidates from filing for both the primary and caucus, leading tosome confusionamong Republican voters who have received mail ballots that do not list the former president or other top Republican contenders. “I'm receiving phone calls from people that I respect in the community and have an understanding of the political world and news in general,” Lombardo said. “They're still confused that Trump and [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis are not [included in] the primary ballot …it's a convolution of information that has been brought forward in a short period of time.” Lombardo said he is still determining where he will caucus.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/republican-former-treasurer-dan-schwartz-to-challenge-susie-lee-in-district-3,True,"Former Nevada Treasurer Dan Schwartz on Wednesday announced a campaign for Southern Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, joining the race weeks after presumed Republican front-runner Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas)dropped outin early January. Schwartz, who served as state treasurer from 2015 to 2019, pledged to contribute $1 million of his personal funds to his campaign, according to his announcement. His platform includes enacting term limits for members of Congress, creating new incentives to spur military and public service recruitment and “clos[ing] the border.” Schwartz joins a Republican primary field that includes former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien (R-Las Vegas) and tax analyst Drew Johnson. The winner will face Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) in a competitive district that she has won in three straight cycles. Schwartz has run in nearly every election cycle in Nevada since 2012, losing multiple congressional bids. He previously ran in the Republican primary for the 3rd District in 2020, finishing second to Dan Rodimer. He also finished fourth in the Republican primary for District 4 in 2012, second in the Republican primary for governor in 2018 and fourth in the Republican primary for lieutenant governor in 2022. As state treasurer, Schwartz made headlines forpublicly opposingthen-Gov.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nv-supreme-court-seats-uncontested-in-2024-judicial-filing-brings-expanded-info-on-candidates,True,"Often overlooked amid the high-profile races for president, U.S. Senate and governor that dominate airwaves and voters’ mailboxes every election season, local and statewide judicial races are critical for shaping Nevada’s criminal justice system — from local justices of the peace to the state Supreme Court. At the close of the state’s judicial filing period Friday, more than 100 candidates had officially registered to run for office, from tiny townships in rural Nevada to major urban district courts. The candidate filing period for other seats up for election in 2024 will come in March. Three of the Nevada Supreme Court’s seven members are up for re-election this year, though all are running unopposed, essentially guaranteeing they will return to the court for six-year terms. The incumbents are: The Nevada Supreme Court typically has a final say on lawsuits involving the Nevada Constitution and ballot questions, as well as high-profile criminal and civil cases (few cases decided by this court will land before the U.S. Supreme Court). For example, in December 2020,the court dismissedan appeal from then-President Donald Trump’s campaign seeking to overturn the state’s presidential election results. The Nevada Supreme Court also has other broad powers, including setting rules forlegal practicesand forcriminal procedures, completingstate-level canvassesof election results, serving on the Board of Pardons Commissioners and generally administering the state’s judicial system. Despite their importance, these elections are often marked by lower turnout. In 2022 — another year that saw no contested state Supreme Court races — about 140,000 people who voted for a gubernatorial candidate did not vote in a state Supreme Court race. Roughly a quarter of those who didvote in the Supreme Court racesselected “none of these candidates” rather than the only candidate in the race. Supreme Court racesvarysignificantlyby state. Other states, for example, have partisan races for seats on their highest court. Some states haveretention elections, in which voters decide whether they want to keep a justice in place. In some states, justices are chosen by the governor or legislature, or a combination of the two. Direct elections in Nevada and elsewhere give greater power to voters over choosing candidates, but can be influenced by outside interests that intervene in campaigning. Supporters of other methodsarguethey can protect the independence of the judiciary. Because the candidates in Nevada’s judicial races are identified as nonpartisan and face campaign restrictions — such as not being allowed to placeparty affiliation on campaign materials— races for judicial seats are often defined by a lack of information and awareness about the candidates. But a new requirement in place for this election is aimed at providing voters with more information about the candidates for these critical judicial seats. Last year, the Legislature passedSB418, which requires all non-incumbent judicial candidates to complete a publicly available questionnaire that includes their education, qualifications and work history. The requirement is similar to guidelines set by the Commission on Judicial Selection for filling any vacancies. “Voting for judges can be difficult or confusing because we don’t know them very well,” Sen. Melanie Scheible (D-Las Vegas), who sponsored the bill, said at a legislative hearing last year. “They can’t stand up on a podium and tell us how they feel about different provisions of the Constitution, or different U.S. Supreme Court decisions or policy matters.” The bill, which passed with bipartisan support and was signed into law by Gov. Joe Lombardo, wasamendedlate in the legislative process to exclude incumbent judges from having to fill out the questionnaire. Local jurisdictions are maintaining lists of these questionnaires online, which can be foundhere. Similar dynamics play out in other down-ballot judicial races. Of the more than 100 candidates who filed, more than 80 percent are running for justice of the peace positions. These are positions in jurisdictions ranging from Las Vegas to Eureka County who typically handle misdemeanors, evictions, traffic matters and disputes over property valued up to $10,000. The judges also are the first stop in the justice system to determine if there is probable cause to charge a defendant and move the case up to district court. Among the local races, former Republican assemblywoman and Las Vegas City Councilwoman Michele Fiore is seeking a full term as a justice of the peace in Pahrump. Nye County commissionersappointed herto the role in December 2022 shortly after she lost a statewide race for treasurer, despite her lack of legal experience andquestions about her residency. Fiore now faces three challengers in her bid to stay in the position. The list of judicial elections this year also includes a few local municipal court seats, where judges typically handle low-level traffic and misdemeanor cases. There are also a slew of candidates running for district court positions, including one vacant seat in department 27 of the Clark County District Court that has two candidates. These judges have jurisdiction over all legal disputes in a county and oversee jury trials, mediation and arbitration hearings. They can also hear appeals from lower courts. For serious crimes, a judge in this role could determine the sentence for a defendant convicted of murder and whether someone could be sentenced to death. At the Clark County District Court, some candidates are seeking seats in the family division, where a judge could rule on a case to approve or deny a parent custody over a child. Some of these seats are also pivotal for reviewing more notable political cases, such as in the Carson City District Court, where lawsuits challenging state laws and ballot initiatives are required to be filed. This court has already been pivotal in shaping the 2024 election, with one judge in this court ruling against a pair of different proposed ballot initiatives seeking toprotect reproductive rightsin the Nevada Constitution and tooverturn a 2023 state lawestablishing public funding for a Major League Baseball stadium in Las Vegas. In a race for a Carson City District Court seat, the incumbent judge Kristin Luis is seeking a full term after stepping into the role earlier this month following herappointmentby Gov. Joe Lombardo. Luis faces a challenge from Mark Krueger, a chief deputy attorney general who also applied for the vacant seat Luis filled.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/as-give-to-lawmakers-democrats-hold-cash-advantage-campaign-finance-reports-show,True,"A Democratic fundraising machine keeps pumping. The Oakland A’s deliver campaign funds. And cash flows into the Las Vegas mayoral race. Those are just a few takeaways from a year's worth of campaign finance activity reported on the secretary of state’s website ahead of Tuesday’s reporting deadline. The reports include details of campaign fundraising and spending throughout 2023 for many Nevada politicians, from state lawmakers and local city council candidates to candidate PACs and ballot initiative groups. Federal candidates, such as members of Congress, report their fundraising activity to the U.S. Federal Election Commission and will have their next reports published at the end of January. As of Tuesday afternoon — with some reports still yet to be filed ahead of the midnight deadline — the state’s most prolific fundraiser in 2023 was Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who brought in nearly $1.5 million for himself and another $432,000 for his legal defense fund in his first year as the state’s top-ranking official. Lombardo hasused the fund to pay legal feesrelated to a failed lawsuit from an opponent who challenged his 2022 primary election win and tofight a censure and finefrom the Nevada Ethics Commission. A group tied to the governor called the Nevada Way PAC also raised $928,000, while making contributions to a slew of legislative candidates endorsed by Lombardo, as he works to prevent Democrats from securing veto-proof supermajorities in the Legislature ahead of the next session in 2025. Other top fundraisers included a pair of local government candidates in high-profile Southern Nevada races: Clark County Commissioner Michael Naft, who is running for re-election, and former Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV), who is running for Las Vegas mayor. Each raised more than $1.1 million last year. But one of the biggest fundraising hauls came from Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, a PAC seeking to enshrine abortion access in the Nevada Constitution via ballot initiative. The group recorded raising $1.8 million, driven primarily by $1 million from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Think Big America. Another $525,000 came from Nevada Alliance, a pro-Democratdark moneygroup. The Nevada Independentwill have additional coverage and analysis of campaign finance activity in the coming days as additional reports are made available online, but for now, here are takeaways from the early reports. A’s spread wealth to ‘yes’ (and ‘no’) votes on stadium bill The Nevada Independentobtained a reportindicating that Major League Baseball’s Oakland A’s collectively donated $88,000 to state lawmakers after legislators approved a $380 million public financing package to help build a proposed Las Vegas stadium in a special session last year. Top recipients were Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) and Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas), who each received a maximum contribution of $10,000 from the team. Budget committee chair Sen. Marilyn Dondero Loop (D-Las Vegas), Minority Leader P.K. O’Neill (R-Carson City) and Majority Floor Leader Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) each received $5,000. Historically, members of the political leadership — who drive decision-making and are typically among each party’s best fundraisers — tend toget bigger donationsthan rank-and-file members, but legislative leaders were not the only ones to receive donations from the team. The A’s donated to lawmakers who were not term-limited or decided not to run for re-election, giving 31 Assembly members $1,000 each in contributions and 11 members of the Senate $2,000 each — 11 of the recipients were “no” votes on the public financing package, 35 were “yes” votes on the deal, and one was marked excused from the vote. Some of the donations were made before a candidate decided to run for re-election or a separate office. Notably absent from the list of recipients were the handful of senators and Assembly members outwardly hostile to the deal. The partisan gap In recent history, Nevada Democrats have dominated Republicans in the fundraising competition — including a comparison between state parties. The Nevada State Democratic Partyreportedraising $800,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 — including $500,000 from a pair of groups tied to the country’s largest carpenters union and $100,000 from The Venetian Las Vegas, previously  owned by GOP megadonor family, the Adelsons. By comparison, the Nevada Republican Party Central Committee reported raising $15,000 across all of 2023 — an amount that does not include the $55,000 each candidate for the Republican presidential caucus paid to the state GOP. Leading the way in the Legislature, Cannizzaro reported raising $380,000, and enters the year with nearly $714,000 in cash on hand (and as of now no declared challenger). She was followed by Yeager, perennially a top legislative fundraiser even before he was elected to leadership, who netted more than $297,000 in 2023 and enters 2024 with more than $452,000 in cash on hand. No other legislative candidates reported fundraising totals approaching those numbers. Challengers rev up the fundraising machine Many of the biggest fundraising efforts in 2023 came from candidates in key Las Vegas-based races of 2024 — from the hefty warchests of incumbents on the Las Vegas City Council to Republican April Becker raising $329,000 in her bid to break up Democratic uniformity on the Clark County Commission. But across a spate of legislative races, Republican challengers seeking to prevent Democratic supermajorities in 2025 also posted large fundraising totals. David Brog, a Republican former congressional candidate who is running for Assembly District 37 and has been endorsed by Lombardo, reported raising $152,000. That puts him far ahead of the district’s incumbent, Assemblywoman Shea Backus (D-Las Vegas), who raised $68,000 and won her 2022 race by about 800 votes out of 31,000 cast. Backus also reportedraising $50,000via her Our Best Nevada PAC, all from a Clark County Education Association PAC. Lori Rogich, a Lombardo-endorsed challenger running in Senate District 11, reported raising $166,000, a sizable haul as she looks to challenge Sen. Dallas Harris (D-Las Vegas). And John Steinbeck, a Lombardo-endorsed candidate and Clark County fire chief seeking to fill the Senate District 18 seat left open by the exit of Sen. Scott Hammond (R-Las Vegas), reported raising more than $101,000. Executive officers aren’t on the ballot. So why are their fundraising hauls so big? 2026 is when the current terms for Nevada’s six constitutional officers will expire. For two of them who are prohibited from running again because of term limits — Attorney General Aaron Ford and Treasurer Zach Conine — fundraising continued unabated as each considers their political future. Ford reported raising $391,000 and has nearly $200,000 in cash on hand, while Conine reported raising $248,000. Conine had previously announced a $750,000 fundraising year for himself and his PAC, Let’s Get to Work Nevada, though that money raised by the PAC included $500,000 from Blockchains CEO Jeffrey Berns. For the other four, including Lombardo, 2026 will likely mean re-election, and some are building their war chests ahead of time. Democratic Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar reported raising $220,000 in 2023 — a big step up from the less than $25,000 that Republican Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony and Republican Controller Andy Matthews collectively reported raising. Anthony, for his part, was hampered by a fundraising blackout that affected his position, the governor and lawmakers, limiting them from raising any money for 30 days before a regular legislative session through 30 days afterward. But under a2023 law, the other statewide officers will now be subject to the same restriction.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/senate-candidate-sam-brown-endorses-trump-for-president,True,"Republican U.S. Senate candidate Sam Brown endorsed Donald Trump’s presidential bid Friday, choosing to embrace the likely Republican presidential candidate amid attacks from primary opponents. “It’s time for Nevada Republicans to unite our ticket to defeat Joe Biden and Jacky Rosen in November,” Browntold Breitbart News. “I am endorsing Donald J. Trump for President in 2024 because he has proven he can deliver on the results Nevada needs, and I believe he will deliver on them again.” Brown, an Army veteranbackedby the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), had threaded the needle on Trump up to this point, embracing “America First” language whiledeclining to endorsethe embattled party leader in a July interview after his campaign launch. Fellow Republican candidatesJim MarchantandJeff Gunterhad already endorsed Trump, and frequently hammered Brown on his lack of support. Gunter, in particular, has been active online in criticizing Brown,calling hima “Never Trumper” and “RINO,” or Republican in Name Only. Both have sought to portray themselves as the true Make America Great Again candidate in the race, referring to Brown as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s “handpicked” establishment candidate. The primary winner will go on to face first-term Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in the general election. Brown’s Trump endorsement fits within the political persona he cultivated as a challenger to eventual candidate Adam Laxalt in the 2022 Senate Republican primary. Brown volunteered on Trump’s 2020 campaign in Nevada. In 2022, he accused Laxalt of failing Republicans as Trump’s campaign co-chair, saying Laxalt’s efforts to aid Trump’s legal challenges to the 2020 election fell short. All of Trump’s legal challenges to the 2020 election in Nevada, a state he lost, failed, and there wasno evidence of widespread fraudin the state. As the frontrunner with national backing this time around, Brown had been more muted on Trump and the 2020 election, saying it did not need to be “relitigated.” Brown’s Trump endorsement attempts to shut down the “Never Trump” line of criticism Gunter had been pursuing and paves the way for a potential endorsement from the party’s kingmaker, should he choose to weigh in. But Brown’s stance will also open him up to further criticism from Nevada Democrats eager to tie him to a candidate who has twice lost Nevada. In 2022, Trump-backed Senate candidates — from Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania to Herschel Walker in Georgia — frequently won primaries only to lose in the general election. But with a 2024 electorate shaped by a Republican base still passionate about the former president, candidates across the country’s political calculus appear to favor endorsing. In Montana, where Republicans want to knock off vulnerable Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), NRSC-backed Tim Sheehy and Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT) haveendorsedTrump. The same situation is occurring in Ohio, where Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) is a top target. Two of the state’s top three candidates haveendorsedTrump — and he responded in kind by endorsing businessman Bernie Moreno. In the race for Michigan’s open Senate seat, favored recruit Mike Rogers, a former Trump critic,endorsedthe presidential frontrunner Tuesday. With all major Nevada candidates aboard the Trump train, the most critical endorsement in the Nevada Senate primary now belongs to the former president himself. The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. Each candidate has a plausible reason to suspect he might receive it. Brown, as the NRSC’s choice, will have Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), who heads the campaign arm, lobbying for him — and Daines, a Trump endorser himself,toldThe New York Timeshe’s working closely with the former president on the Senate map. Marchant, meanwhile, was previously endorsed by Trump in his 2022 run for secretary of state and has alreadyhosted a fundraiserat Mar-a-Lago this cycle. And Gunter, who served in the Trump administration as his ambassador to Iceland,told supportersto “stay tuned” when discussing how a Trump endorsement was worth more than the $1.85 million Brown raised in the fourth quarter.",Error: Connection error.

His announcement came just days after the Sparks City Council unanimously approved a $381,000 settlement to Lawson. This settlement ended a monthslong legal battle between Lawson and the city that was a result of the former fire chief pushing back against what he called an unfair firing. The city said Lawson resigned after Sparks staff learned he was facing “serious criminal charges,”according to KRNV. Lawson’s criminal case, which involved four felony steroid charges, was dismissed without prejudice (meaning prosecutors can file it again) in early February.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-counties-looking-to-hire-more-poll-workers-as-election-nears,True,"Less than one month before Nevada’s presidential primaries, poll worker positions in some counties remain unfilled, according to the secretary of state’s office. Clark County has about 100 unfilled poll worker jobs out of the roughly 3,000 total positions. In Douglas County, about half of the poll worker positions are unfilled, which amounts to roughly 60 jobs. The shortage comes after anexodus of election workersdue to the unprecedented rise in threats against workers in the aftermath of the 2020 election. The threats were fueled by false claims of widespread voter fraud. In a Wednesday morning press conference, Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar and Attorney General Aaron Ford, both Democrats, outlined how the state is hoping to bring on more poll workers and address complaints of electoral misconduct. Aguilar said he has spoken with several board members of the State Bar of Nevada to allow licensed attorneys to become poll workers as part of their continuing legal education requirements. The board is scheduled to meet next week. Such initiatives are already in place in states including Ohio and Kentucky. “If Nevada incentivizes lawyers to volunteer as poll workers, they can bring with them their expertise and the authority of the law,” Aguilar told reporters. Aguilar also said his office is working with counties to fill poll worker gaps, but he did not disclose specifics. ASeptember reportfrom Issue One, a “crosspartisan” group that pushes for political and electoral reforms, found that 96 percent of Nevadans will see the 2024 election administered by someone different than the official who oversaw the 2020 vote. Across 11 Western states analyzed in the report, election officials who departed had more than 1,800 years of combined experience. Deanna Spikula, who was the Washoe County registrar during the 2020 election, resigned in part because of death threats she faced after the election. Her replacement, Jamie Rodriguez,resignedlast week to pursue “opportunities outside elections,” and the new registrar will be appointed at the county commission meeting next week. At Wednesday’s press conference, Aguilar and Ford also discussed how their offices are handling election security ahead of the three statewide elections this year. For this year’s elections, the secretary of state’s office has two civil investigators and one criminal investigator who will focus on reports of election law violations. After cases are investigated, they will be sent to the attorney general’s office for possible prosecution. The state will also release quarterly reports on the status of elections investigations, and state law enforcement officials will be on the ground during this year’s elections to investigate complaints of election integrity violations, Ford said. The office found no evidence of wrongdoing in 84 percent of those reports, and some cases are still being investigated. Since 2020, 14 election integrity violations have been referred to the attorney general’s office for potential prosecution. “The 2024 elections will be free, fair and safe,” Ford said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/suit-to-bar-trump-from-nevada-ballot-over-role-in-jan-6-dismissed-for-lack-of-standing,True,"A Nevada-based federal judge on Mondaydismisseda lawsuit that sought to bar former President Donald Trump from the ballot in Nevada over Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021 uprising after the judge found the Texas man who filed the case lacked standing to do so. U.S. District Court Judge Gloria Navarro cited other federal district court decisions, including those in New Hampshire and Southern Florida, to reject similar casesfiled by John Anthony Castro, a 40-year-old longshot Republican presidential candidate who has sought lawsuits to remove Trump from the ballot in multiple states under the argument that Trump is ineligible under the “insurrection” clause of the 14th Amendment. “In rejecting his political competitor standing argument, courts have found that Castro improperly manufactured his standing merely to file this lawsuit,” Navarrowrote, citing evidence that Castro is running for office simply to pursue these lawsuits against Trump. Navarro pointed to a Castro quote in anAssociated Pressarticle, in which he stated, “I’m not going to lie and pretend my candidacy is anything more than trying to enforce the United States Constitution, and that’s what I’m here to do.” Castro filed to run in the state’s presidential primary, while Trump is running in the Nevada GOP’s presidential caucus.Read more about the two contestshere. Navarro declined to rule on the merits of Castro’s argument, though one court has done so as Trump challengers have pursued similar lawsuits indozens of states. Castro's suit appears to be the only one in Nevada making such an argument. Most notably, the Colorado Supreme Courtruled last monththat Trump is disqualified from being president under the14th Amendment, a Civil War-era provision that bars from office any person who “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” after taking the oath of office. Trump has appealed that decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court isset to hear oral argumentsin the case on Feb. 8, the same day as the Nevada GOP caucus. In a statement Tuesday, a Trump campaign spokesman heralded the Nevada court decision as a victory for the former president and Nevada voters and blasted other cases similarly seeking to bar Trump from the ballot under the 14th Amendment.

The $3.2 million figure is Rosen’sbest three-month fundraising total of the cyclethus far, and keeps her campaignon pacewith Sen.

Cortez Masto raised $3.3 million in the final quarter of 2021 and had $10.4 million on hand at this point in 2022. In a statement, Rosen’s campaign said it received donations from more than 19,000 first-time donors in the quarter, and that the average donation size was $27. Details on Rosen’s specific donors and campaign spending will be released by Jan. 31, the Federal Election Commission’s campaign finance deadline for the fourth quarter. Though Rosen’s haul thus far is record-setting, the majority of spending on Nevada’s Senate race will come from outside groups.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/ballot-initiative-filed-to-cap-nevada-payday-loan-interest-rates,True,"A recently formednonprofitfocused on ending high-interest lending in the state has filed paperwork to begin circulating a petition focused on capping interest rates on certain loans. The initiative —filed last weekwith the secretary of state’s office — is the latest effort to crack down on payday loans, typically defined as short-term loans where individuals receive immediate cash and agree to pay back the loan (typically with a high rate of interest) within a short period of time. High-interest loan businesses — such as Dollar Loan Center or MoneyTree — are regulated by the state’s Financial Institutions Division, but state law places no maximum cap on the interest rates that can be attached to a loan. The initiative was filed by a recently created nonprofit called Stop Predatory Lending NV and seeks to place a 36 percent annual cap on the interest rates for certain categories of loans, includingpayday loansandtitle loans. For the measure to go up for a vote in the Legislature next year, petition supporters must gather and submit at least 102,362 signatures by Nov. 20, with at least 25,591 signatures coming from each of the state’s four congressional districts. If the Legislature does not pass the initiative when it meets in 2025, the question would be placed on the 2026 general election ballot. “With no interest rate limit on these loans, Nevada is currently one of the worst states in the country for predatory lending practices. Nevadans deserve better. This initiative will provide meaningful protections for Nevada families by capping rates on short-term loans and better protecting assets from unscrupulous debt collectors,” Peter Koltak, a longtime Democratic campaign consultant and the spokesperson for Stop Predatory Lending NV, said in a statement. AJune reportfrom The Center for Responsible Lending — a nonprofit that opposes high-interest lending — found that the average interest rate for Nevada payday loans was 548 percent, the fifth-highest rate in the country. The initiative would also protect up to $5,000 in a person’s bank account from seizure for an unpaid debt, an increase from the current maximum of $400. It would also raise the amount of weekly wages exempt from any kind of garnishment or seizure to up to $850, a rise from the current rate of $369. These values would increase periodically along with inflation. The strategy of placing a question on the ballot to cap interest rates has had success in other states. InSouth Dakota, for example, a 2016 ballot question to cap interest rates at 36 percent received 76 percent of voters’ support. The high-interest lending industry has drawn some scrutiny from state legislators, but nothing has been done to cap interest rates, which were repealed in 1984 through aspecial legislative sessionto incentivize Citicorp to open a credit-card processing center in the state. A 2017billthat would have capped interest rates at the same rate as the ballot proposal stalled in committee. A 2019 law (SB201)created a databasethat tracks high-interest loans and their compliance with state law. Similar legislation failed in the 2017 legislative session. The state’s payday lending industry fiercely opposed theregulationssurrounding the legislation as overly broad, while proponents heralded the effort as a much-needed accountability measure. A state audit in 2018foundthat nearly a third of payday lenders had received a less than satisfactory rating from regulators over the previous five years. From February 2022 to January 2023, around 150,000 payday loans were made in the state, about 15 percent of which were paid after the due date, according to areportby the state’s Financial Institutions Division.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-gop-drops-lawsuit-aimed-at-blocking-presidential-primary,True,"The Nevada State Republican Party on Friday agreed to drop a lawsuit against the state that had sought to stop next month’s presidential preference primary — ending a monthslong legal battle and ensuring that both the state-run primary and the party-run caucus will be held in early February. Nevada lawmakers created the new primary system in 2021, but the state GOP argued in aninitial filing last Maythat the law would prevent party leaders from opting for the state’s existing caucus model in 2024. A Carson City District Court judge sided against the partyin July, ruling that both a primary and caucus could move forward under the law. State party Chair Michael McDonaldsaidin July that the lawsuit was intended to avoid confusing voters and wasting taxpayer dollars on a primary election that would not count toward Nevada’s delegate count for the Republican nomination. The party filed an appeal to the Nevada Supreme Courtin August, but it was never heard. Attorneys representing the state and Nevada Republican Party filed the joint stipulation to dismiss the appeal last week. Reached by phone Monday, attorney and Republican National Committeewoman Sigal Chattah — who represented the state GOP on the case — argued the district court ruling was not a loss, because it still allowed the party to decide to bind its delegates through the caucus, rather than the primary. Last year, the party decided to continue its case, Chattah said, because “first and foremost, the [presidential primary] is a waste of money.” “Why is the Nevada taxpayer going to be on the hook for a primary that is completely irrelevant?” Chattah said. However, she declined to explain the timing of the party’s decision to drop the lawsuit last week, just one month before the scheduled primary, citing confidential settlement discussions. A spokesperson for Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. The state-run primary willcontinueas scheduled on Feb. 6, while the party-run caucus will occur Feb. 8. The proximity of the two contests has created ongoing confusion within the party rank and file, as voters receiving primary ballots have questioned why major candidates — including former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, both caucus participants — are not included. Separately, the competing caucus and primary processes have drawn intraparty criticism, amid charges from Trump opponents that the rules surrounding the caucus were designed to favor the former president. That criticism has largely centered on a rule barring super PACs from participating in the caucus itself — a blow that would have an outsized effect on DeSantis, who hasrelied heavilyon a pair ofoutside super PACsto buoy his campaign in early primary states. The caucus also came under fire from Gov. Joe Lombardo (R), whocalledthe confusion over the dueling contests, and their separate pools of candidates, “unacceptable.” In addition to Trump and DeSantis, other caucus candidates include former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and pastor Ryan Binkley. On the state-run primary ballot, which will not count for delegates, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is the only major candidate remaining who has not suspended their campaign. She will appear alongside former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), as well four, little-known long-shot candidates (John Anthony Castro, Heath Fulkerson, Hirsh Singh and Donald Kjornes).",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sen-jacky-rosens-speech-in-las-vegas-crashed-by-pro-palestine-protesters,True,"A group of pro-Palestine protesters interrupted a Friday event in Las Vegas where Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) was speaking and the senator had to be escorted out a back door. Near the end of the meeting, hosted by the nonpartisan group Hispanics in Politics at a Mexican restaurant, three women who appeared to be in their 20s or 30s and had sat through Rosen’s speech stood up and confronted her, asking why she “supports genocide” and continues to supportbillionsof dollars in aid to Israel, referring to the war between Hamas and Israel that has resulted in thousands of deaths in the Gaza Strip after the terrorist group attacked and killed around 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7. The meeting swiftly ended and attendees made their way out as one of the protesters continued yelling about the deaths the war has resulted in. Before the disruption in the meeting, chants from about 10 protesters outside the building could be heard and the lights of a police vehicle could be seen through a window where the meeting was held in downtown Las Vegas. Rosen has been vocal aboutsupportingIsrael. She is Jewish and previously served as president of the Ner Tamid congregation, Nevada's largest synagogue. Rosen is running for re-election in one of the most closely watched Senate races in the country. Asked for comment about the disruption, her office sent a statement noting that Rosen “believes the United States must support Israel as it eliminates Hamas while allowing for more humanitarian aid for innocent civilians in Gaza.” Fernando Romero, president of Hispanics in Politics, said afterward that the meeting “was not ruined” by the protesters as it was closing up but that the yelling “frightened” the attendees. “They antagonized people so much that they frightened people, to the point that they were not hearing what they were protesting about,” he said. “Maybe next time hold down the tone and maybe people listen.” Updated at 4:15 p.m. on 1/8/2024 to clarify the death toll of the Oct. 7 attack.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-lawmaker-heidi-kasama-drops-out-of-congressional-race-against-susie-lee,True,"Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas) — an establishment-backed Republican challenging Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) in Congressional District 3 — announced Thursday that she will drop out of the race in order to run for re-election to her Assembly seat. The surprise move comes as a blow for House Republicans, who have long targeted Lee’s seat as one of the top pickup opportunities among Nevada’s three competitive congressional districts. “A victory in CD3 would be hollow if the governor was left without his veto ability, and we know how critical that is for our state,” Kasama said in a phone interview Thursday. Sinceannouncingher candidacy in August, Kasama said D.C. leadership has been very supportive but after speaking with her family, constituents and Gov. Joe Lombardo, she realized she is needed in the Legislature. Kasama’s exit is a boon to Lee, who has won by narrow margins in three successive elections. Kasama is a proven fundraiser from her time in the Legislature with the backing of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Lombardo. A national source familiar with the race who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Republicans are not concerned that flipping the district is out of reach, but rather that Kasama was unable to make the leap from fundraising for a state legislative race to a congressional one. (Federal races have lower maximum donation limits than state races). Federal campaign finance reports for the last three months of 2023 will be released on Jan. 31. Other announced GOP candidates in Congressional District 3 include former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien and policy analyst Drew Johnson. Kasama hadraisedover $300,000 through the third quarter of 2023, while Helgelien and Johnson had about $50,000 and $100,000 in cash on hand, respectively. Kasama said she does not plan to endorse a candidate in the primary. In a statement, Johnson said Kasama’s exit indicates that his campaign is “on the right track” but still expects the primary to be competitive. Kasama’s exit leaves Republican leadership in Nevada and in Washington without a handpicked candidate and positions Lee, with more than $1 million in cash on hand, as by far the best-funded candidate in the race. Had she won the primary, she would have been Lee’s first opponent with political experience. National Republican Campaign Committee spokesperson Ben Petersen said the party still expects Lee to lose and that “Republicans are full speed ahead to flip this seat as the political environment continues to worsen for extreme Democrat Susie Lee.” A Democratic source familiar with the race said while they believe the district is still in play, a strong candidate — which the race now lacks — would have made Lee’s re-election effort more expensive and challenging. Kasama said keeping control of Assembly District 2 is a “critical seat” in Republican efforts to avoid a Democratic supermajority heading into the next legislative session. The district has a fairly even split among major party groups, with 30 percent of voters registered as Democrats, 31 percent registered as Republicans and 32 percent registered as nonpartisan. Democrats hold a 28-seat supermajority in the 42-member Assembly and a 13-seat majority in the 21-member Senate — just one seat shy of another supermajority. Flipping one Senate seat and maintaining a hold on existing Assembly seats would hand Democrats the power to override Lombardo’s vetoes in next year’s legislative session, just two years after the governor set therecord for vetoesin 2023. However — even after legislative Democratsredrew district maps in their favorin 2021 — Democratic margins in the Assembly remain in flux, amid an exodus of sitting lawmakers who have bowed out ofre-election bids. That includes five Assembly Democrats who have announced they will leave the Legislature altogether, and another four who have announced campaigns for other seats. So far, only one other Republican has announced a bid for Kasama’s Assembly District 2: Clark County Republican Chair Jesse Law, a fixture of the county GOP and one of six so-called“fake electors”criminally charged by Nevada’s Democratic attorney general over the 2020 scheme to keep former President Donald Trump in power. The Democratic source said Kasama’s decision indicates Lombardo must be increasingly concerned about the potential for a Democratic supermajority in both chambers rendering his governorship irrelevant — and that he was worried about holding Assembly District 2 if Law is the candidate. Asked whether she plans to run for Congress in the future, Kasama demurred, saying she is focused on her legislative election. This is a developing story and will be updated.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-vegas-kamala-harris-visit-to-culinary-union-spotlights-labor-role-in-2024-election,True,"Officially, Vice President Kamala Harris swung through Las Vegas Wednesday on a victory lap for organized labor, meeting with Culinary Workers Union Local 226 members at the union’s downtown headquarters to celebrate theirrecently negotiated contractswith major Las Vegas Strip casino properties. Flanked by acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, the Democrats of Nevada’s congressional delegation and Culinary leadership, Harris congratulated the union members on their new contracts and mounted a defense of organized labor as the “backbone of the strength of our nation.” Unofficially, Harris’ visit is the latest in a run of campaign-esque events taking place in Nevada with an official White House veneer as she and President Joe Biden gear up for re-election. And while she did not discuss the election or Biden’s likely opponent Donald Trump by name, Harris animatedly drew a distinction between the two candidates’ leadership styles — and which are union-esque. “They're pushing this stuff that suggests that the measure of the strength of the leader is based on who you beat down, instead of what we know,” Harris said. “The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.” Harris — making her ninth trip to the Silver State since taking office in 2021— last came to Nevada in October, where a Q&A event at the College of Southern Nevadaplayed out like a rally. Biden, meanwhile, turned last month’s announcement offederal dollars for a high speed rail linebetween Southern Nevada and Southern California into an invective that just as often bashed the Trump administration and the country’s largest corporations. Undergirding both visits: Organized labor as a key pillar of Democratic electoral success. Biden’s speech was delivered from a sprawling Las Vegas training facility for the local carpenters union. Harris’ visit celebrated Culinary’s recent successful contract negotiations withmajor hospitality employersincluding Caesars, Wynn and MGM International that landed workers a 32 percent raise over five years. On a drab and drizzly Vegas afternoon, a crowd of about 250 people, many of them red-shirted Culinary members, filled the union’s headquarters for Harris’ speech — an event that opened with a mariachi band that had much of the crowd singing along in Spanish. Harris was introduced by Elena Newman, a guest room attendant at Mandalay Bay and member of the Culinary executive board who recounted Harris’ support in her prior visit. “She told us that [if] we were going to strike, she will be here to walk the picket line with us,” Newman said. “And that was a very powerful message.” The message also resonated for Culinary members still negotiating contracts with downtown casinos and other union properties in Las Vegas. Satoria Partridge, a Culinary member and employee at Circa in downtown Las Vegas, credited the Culinary contracts with the three biggest casino companies at least in part on White House backing, and said Harris' visit Wednesday “means that we have people that have our back.” Partridge, a registered Democrat, said she fully backed Biden’s re-election bid and wasn’t overly worried that the 81-year-old incumbent remainswidely unpopularheading into 2024. “I believe that the working class and the younger people are going to come in and they're going to vote,” Partridge said. “And we're going to get them again.” Though the parties narrowly avoided a strike, Culinary’s negotiations in Nevada were part of a larger simmering labor movement around the country last year, with notable strikes in the auto and entertainment industries. The Biden administration wants to cast the “Hot Labor Summer” — andrecent increasesin union organizing — as a downstream effect of both the policies and rhetoric of a pro-labor leader who became the first sitting president towalk a picket line. It’s an argument Biden will need to pull off to win swing state Nevada, where elections are routinely decided by fewer votes than the number of members in Culinary. “The president has never been shy about saying that unions built the middle class,” said Yvanna Cancela, a former Culinary political director who now serves as a senior adviser at The White House, in an interview before the speech. “And I think his commitment has created an environment where workers are organizing and winning.” Cancela cited figures of job growth and investment in the Silver State as proof positive of Biden’s support for workers —  the White Houseestimatesthat 239,000 jobs have been added in Nevada and over $8 billion has been committed by private companies since January 2021. Harris did not discuss policy specifics. But the campaign is banking on a symbiotic relationship with unions like Culinary, which it will rely on to tout their labor principles. The Biden administration’s major legislative accomplishments — the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act — all aim to spur domestic manufacturing and job creation via federal investments thatfavor projectswith project-labor agreements and pre-hire bargaining agreements. And his Department of Laborrestoredthe prevailing wage standard for workers on federal construction projects including the plannedhigh-speed rail linefrom Las Vegas to Southern California. Those moves have earned Biden the endorsement of several major unions,includingCulinary and its mightydoor-knocking operation. In 2022, Culinary canvassers decked out in union-red shirts took credit for knocking on 1 million doors, a number that they said at the time “delivered” the Senate race for incumbent Democrat Cortez Masto. When the top-of-the-ticket Senate race was too close to call,Culinary volunteers racedto ensure Democratic voters were curing ballot signatures, fixing errant ballots in time for them to be counted ahead of legal deadlines. On theRepublican side, Trump has made more of a play for the union rank-and-file, arguing his administrationnegotiatedbetter trade deals after making the decline of Rust Belt manufacturing a critical theme in his 2016 campaign. He has promised to continue the protectionist policies he enacted as president, includingmajor new tariffs. Harris’ speech comes as the Trump campaign’s top brasscirculated a memosaying the former president will be explicitly targeting Democratic constituencies including union members — a group heoverperformedwith in 2016, with rank-and-file members in the Midwest helping flip the traditional blue wall. While in office, Trump’sNational Labor Relations Boardsupported employers in their efforts to categorize workers as independent contractors and relaxed the standard for employers to dismantle existing worker unions — earning the ire of union leaders. The two frontrunners clashed on the labor battlefield in September, when each visited Michigan amidst the United Auto Workers strike — Trump to a non-unionized auto shop toslamBiden on his embrace of electric vehicles, Biden to the UAW picket line urging workers to stand firm in their demands. Nevadaexit pollsfrom the 2020 election show union households breaking sharply in favor of Biden over Trump — 58 percent to 39 percent. However, only 19 percent of voters reported being in a union household.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-reno-trump-looks-to-stake-claim-on-nevada-gop-ahead-of-february-caucus,True,"Former President Donald Trump looked to cement his base during a Reno rally on Sunday, repeating much of his regular stump speech for a Northern Nevada audience in his second major Silver State rally ahead of the Feb. 8 Republican caucus. That caucus has for months created confusion among the Nevada Republican rank and file, as party leaders have sought to differentiate the party-run process from the state-run primary election set for Feb. 6. But in the waning weeks and months before the first presidential contests in 2024, Trump has emerged as the only Republican to repeatedly campaign in the Silver State. That comes in no small part because of an intraparty rift over the caucus rules, which some of Trump’s opponents — especiallya super PAC linked to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis— have criticized as designed to help the former president. Speaking to a crowd of roughly 1,000 at the Reno Convention Center — taking the stage after a near-90 minute delay — Trump’s speech largely echoed remarks he gave in New Hampshire on Saturday, in which he railed against President Joe Biden’s policies on the economy, the environment, immigration and health care. Sunday’s rally marks the first Trump visit to Nevada since six Republicans wereindicted by a Clark County grand juryearlier this month over a 2020 scheme from his campaign to submit “alternative” slates of electors in key swing states. Among those fake electors is Nevada Republican Party Chair Michael McDonald, who introduced Trump and whose party apparatus has come under criticism from other GOP campaigns over caucus rules they argue were designed to favor Trump. In bringing Trump to the stage, McDonald told the crowd openly: “You come out to your location, you walk in with your neighbors, you sit with your neighbors and tell them how great it is. And then you cast your ballot for Donald Trump.” “They're willing to violate the U.S. Constitution at levels never seen before,” Trump said, referencing Nevada’sfake elector charges. “In order to win, they’re dirty players, they played dirty. They weaponize justice … Look at what they're doing right here to Michael [McDonald].” Attendees traveled from across state lines to the communities on the outskirts of town to rally for the former president and Republican candidate. Betty Moyer, 65, woke up at 4 a.m. to drive from Spanish Springs  — about a half hour drive from the convention center — to wait in line for the 2 p.m. event. She said she has been a Trump supporter since 2016 especially because of his support for veterans. Moyer added that she had been supporting Ted Cruz and was on the fence about voting at all, until she prayed about the decision. She said a total peace came over her body and she had made her decision. “I went down there and I voted for Trump,” she said. “And I don't regret one minute of it. I will vote for him. I will crawl over glass for him.” That fervor was on full display in Reno — even four hours before the entry to his rally opened. Among those who were in the VIP line was Sharon Anderson, 63, from Virginia City. She said she and her husband have been Trump supporters since he announced his candidacy for president in 2015. ""There's not much I don't like about him,"" Anderson said. ""He's hard working. I believe he's honest, he's a businessman. He just has incredible energy."" When asked about the criminal charges Trump is facing, Anderson said: ""I think it's a mess. I don't think it's fair."" During his speech, Trump again pledged to reenact a travel ban from “terror-plagued countries"" and repeated a promise to implement “ideological screening” for incoming immigrants. Trump also read “The Snake,” ananti-immigration poemhe has referenced on the campaign trail for years, and touted himself as the only candidate who could prevent a nuclear world war, referencing his negotiations with foreign leaders, without specifying how such a war would begin or how he would prevent it. Trump also repeated promises to launch federal investigations of “radical, out-of-control prosecutors” and to “indemnify” police officers who were being constrained and “destroyed by the radical left for taking strong action on crime.” Trump did not specify what those actions were. Trump will be among five names to appear on the caucus ballot, alongside DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (who ended his campaign this month) and long-shot candidate and businessman Ryan Binkley. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is the only major GOP candidate on Nevada’s Republican primary ballot with an active campaign, following the exits of former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) (both will remain on the primary ballot, however, after missing the deadline to withdraw in October). Benjamin Eden, 18, of Spanish Springs, said he is excited to cast a ballot for Trump in the first election he's allowed to vote in. Eden, who arrived at 7:30 a.m., said Trump’s efforts to improve the job market and increase border security while he was president were among the reasons he supports the former president. “I haven't seen him in person yet … just great to come out and see what it's all about,” he said. Eden also noted he agreed with Trump “putting in all the judges to overturn abortion.” Trump appointedthree federal judgeswho locked the six-member conservative majority in the Supreme Court that voted to overturnRoe v. Wade. Polling averagesshow the GOP front-runner issubstantially more popularthan his rivals among the Republican primary electorate despite facing91 felonycounts in three criminal cases, including two stemming from Trump’s effort to interfere with the results of the 2020 election (charges Trump called “bullsh*t” during his Reno speech Sunday).

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/reproductive-rights-group-seeks-second-initiative-to-protect-abortion-in-nv-constitution,True,"A reproductive rights group is pursuing a new ballot initiative to protect abortion access in the Nevada Constitution, after the group’sinitial effortto place a similar question on the 2024 ballotstalled amid legal challenges. The newerproposed constitutional amendment— filed last week by Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom — would protect the right to an abortion until fetal viability, generally considered about 23 or 24 weeks, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient. Placing those protections in the state Constitution would make them more difficult to overturn than the same protections already in place in state law. The existing protections wereapproved by Nevada voters in 1990, and can only be overturned by a majority vote. Pro abortion groups have sought similar ballot initiativesacross the countrytojuice Democratic turnoutand give voters a say on abortion access in red states where lawmakers have largelyrestricted the practicesince the U.S. Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wadelast year. The protections in the latest Nevada petition are not as expansive as the ones originally sought by Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom in a petition filed three months ago. The group’s first proposed constitutional amendment would strengthen protections for reproductive care, including guaranteeing individuals the right to make decisions about “all matters relating to pregnancy,” from prenatal and postpartum care to vasectomy and abortion. But last month, a Carson City District Court judge struck down that initiative, agreeing withopponentsthat it violated the single subject rule — a requirement understate lawthat ballot initiatives “embrace one subject.” The group’s efforts to get that initiative back on track are stillpendingin the Nevada Supreme Court. Caroline Mello Roberson, director of state campaigns for the national group Reproductive Freedom for All, said in an interview Thursday the group remains committed to the pending appeal for its first initiative, but is working to ensure reproductive rights are on the ballot in 2024 “one way or the other.” “We're leaving nothing to chance,” Roberson said. “We looked at this and said, OK, well, what's the thing that is the greatest need for us to focus on?’ And that is abortion rights.” Still, she said it was “a little shocking” that the district court judge found topics in the first petition, including birth control and pregnancy options, to not fall under one subject. “We're also waiting to see if anyone files a legal challenge to the alternative measure,” Roberson said. The first petition also contains the same language asSJR7, a constitutional amendmentproposed by Democratic lawmakersthat would guarantee “a fundamental right to reproductive freedom.” That amendment is likely to pass in the Legislature again in 2025 before heading to the 2026 general election ballot, while either initiative sought by Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom would need to pass in the 2024 and 2026 general elections to take effect. If the broader petition is successful, Roberson said, “we would advise the Legislature ‘pull back on SJR7 in 2025,’ so we won't have a duplicative effort.” To qualify either petition for the ballot, the group must obtain signatures from at least 102,362 people (equal to 10 percent of the voters in the previous general election), with at least 25,591 signatures from each of the state’s four congressional districts. The group cannot gather signatures on the first petition, however, while it remains challenged in court.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/clark-county-commissioner-ross-miller-will-not-seek-re-election-in-2024,True," With a year left in his first term, Clark County Commissioner Ross Miller says he is not seeking re-election in 2024 because he wants to pursue opportunities in the private sector. Miller, a Democrat, beat Republican Stavros Anthony by just10 votesduring the 2020 general election to win the seat representingDistrict C, which includes the northwestern neighborhoods of the Las Vegas Valley. A recount sought by Anthony, who is now lieutenant governor, widened Miller’s margin to 30 votes. “There's certainly no shortage of issues that come across your desk as county commissioner,” Miller said in an interview withThe Nevada Independenton Tuesday. “I enjoyed it … But I’ll step aside to let somebody else take on what really turns out to be more than a full-time job.” Miller is a former Clark County deputy district attorney and was ​Nevada secretary of state from 2006 to 2014; he becamethe youngest person to hold the positionat age 30. He’s also the son of former Nevada Gov. Bob Miller. In 2014, he lost a close race for attorney general to Republican Adam Laxalt. Miller said he believes that Las Vegas is en route to becoming an international city on par with well-established metropolises such as Detroit and Chicago. That means more people moving in while the region faces awater crisisandhousing crunch. Miller said leaders have to be cautious while moving the city forward and should ensure they can diversify the economy as well as improve education, expand job opportunities and “try to redevelop the community.” “I think anybody that lives here is excited, proud to be in Las Vegas because of the emergence of [Formula One] and the Super Bowl,” he said. “Vegas is a very hot place to live right now.” He said while holding the role, he’s been “fortunate” to weigh in on plans “during an exciting time for Las Vegas when we're in our adolescence as a city” —  making decisions about regional issues such as economic development, land scarcity, water insecurity and Yucca Mountain. “We're not babies anymore,” he said. “We’re having to deal with real issues … So we're going to make tough decisions about who we want to become and how we're gonna get there.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/independent-redistricting-commission-ballot-questions-challenged-by-democrats,True,"A pair of law firms known for representing Democratic officials and causes filed two lawsuits last week aimed at blocking proposed ballot questions that would take redistricting out of the Legislature’s control. The lawsuits — both filed Thursday in Carson City District Court byBravo SchragerandElias Law Groupon behalf of Las Vegas-based Democratic voter Eric Jeng —arguethat the ballot questions violate the Nevada Constitution because they would create a new state body (an independent redistricting commission) without raising revenue necessary to pay for the expenses of the commission and because the descriptions on signature-gathering forms accompanying the initiatives fail to mention the cost. Fair Maps Nevada, a political action committee led by College of Southern Nevada professor Sondra Cosgrove,filed the pair of initiatives in mid-November. Though the petitions differ in terms of timing, both contain identical language seeking to establish an independent, seven-member commission to draw congressional and legislative district maps, thereby removing state lawmakers’ role in the redistricting process. One petitionwould require new maps be drawn by the end of 2027 (the first possible year the commission would be in place if the measure were to pass in the 2024 and 2026 elections). Theother petitionwould keep the existing district maps in place until the next redistricting cycle, which would likely occur in 2031 after the next decennial U.S. census. Nevada Democrats stand to benefit from keeping power over redistricting with the Legislature. Since 2009, Democrats have controlled both chambers of the Legislature in all but two years (2015-2016), and under maps they drew and approved in 2021, Democrats last year won a supermajority in the Assembly and near-supermajority in the Senate. The party also maintained control over three of the state’s four congressional districts with a map thatspread out Democratic advantagesacross the three Democrat-held districts. ThePrinceton Gerrymandering Projectgave that congressional map an “F” grade for partisan fairness. In one of the complaints filed last week, attorneys representing Jeng, who works for the Asian Community Development Council, wrote that the petition “imposes an unfunded mandate” in violation of the state Constitution, whichprohibitsinitiatives that require the expenditure of funds without a sufficient tax to fund them. Attorneys also wrote that the petition’s description of effect (a 200-word summary of the measure included on signature-gathering forms) is “legally deficient” because it does not state that the petition will result in the expenditure of state funds by the commission. Legal challenges aimed at defeating proposed ballot initiatives often target the description of effect, one of the key requirements for ballot initiativesunder state law. Bradley Schrager, an attorney representing Jeng in the lawsuits, declined to comment on Monday. Financial statementsfor each petition prepared by the Legislative Counsel Bureau’s fiscal analysis division state that “the provisions contained within the initiative … will result in an increase of expenditures for the state government,” though the division “cannot estimate the resultant impact … with any reasonable degree of certainty.” To qualify either petition for the ballot, Fair Maps Nevada must obtain signatures from at least 10 percent of the voters in the previous general election — meaning at least 102,362 signatures are needed to qualify a measure for the 2024 ballot, with at least 25,591 signatures from each of the state’s four congressional districts. Because the petitions propose constitutional amendments, they must pass in two consecutive elections to take effect. In a statement released last week, Fair Maps Nevada criticized Elias Law Group’s support for establishing an independent redistricting commission in Ohio. That support has includedarticles from Democracy Docket, a progressive news site founded by Marc Elias. Cosgrove, who also serves as executive director of the civic engagement nonprofit Vote Nevada, hascriticizedthe state’s current political maps as “gerrymandered.” Cosgrove spearheaded efforts in 2020 and 2022 to change Nevada’s redistricting process, though neither effort made it onto the general election ballot. For the past initiatives, Fair Maps Nevadaraisednearly $18,000 in 2020 (including $10,000 from the Nevada Realtors and $5,000 from the Nevada Auto Dealers, two groups that tend to support conservative candidates), but in 2022, the groupreportedno contributions in excess of $1,000. Like the current petitions, the 2020 petition waschallenged in court— a process that saw the district court approve language added to the petititon’s description of effect stating it would result in the expenditure of state funds. The2022 petitionalso reflected this by including language that the proposed constitutional amendment would “result in the expenditure of state funds to fund the commission.” That specific language related to cost is not present on either petition filed this year. Cosgrove said in an interview Monday that Fair Maps Nevada did not include information about the expenditures because of the 200-word limit on the description of the effect — also arguing that with the petition that launches the independent redistricting process after the 2030 census, the state could rely on the same funding source already used to fund the Legislature’s redistricting process. Though attorneys challenging the petitions citeda Nevada Supreme Court case from 2022dealing with ballot initiatives and funding sources, Cosgrove suggested that requiring ballot initiatives to identify a specific source of funding could run afoul of constitutional rights to file ballot questions — an argument the group may make in court. The lawsuits mark the latest effort in a long line of voting-related lawsuits filed by Schrager and his firm and the Elias Law Group on behalf of Nevada Democratic voters. The two law firms alsofiled a challenge last weekto block a proposed voter ID initiative. In February 2022, the groupsfiled a lawsuit again on behalf of Jengthat challenged a proposed rollback of parts of the state’s vote-by-mail law.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/democrat-linked-attorneys-sue-to-stop-voter-id-ballot-measure,True,"A member of an immigrant advocacy group represented by well-known Democratic attorneys is suing to stop a question aimed at requiring Nevadans to provide photo identification before voting from appearing on next year’s general election ballot. Thelawsuit, filed last Monday in Carson City District Court, argues that the ballot initiative is unconstitutional because its description of effect (a 200-word summary of the measure included on signature forms) does not reflect all of the question’s implications and would expend taxpayer funds as it does not have an identified funding source. Challenging the description of effect is a common tactic in Nevada to persuade judges to reject proposed ballot questions. The suit was filed by a group of Nevada and Washington, D.C.-based attorneys, who are well known for representing Democratic Party causes, on behalf of Jennifer Fleischmann, the development director for Make the Road Nevada, an immigrant advocacy group. Repair the Vote, a political action committee led by former Nevada Republican Club President and former Clark County GOP Chair David Gibbs, filed thepetition for the ballot questionlast month. The initiative aims to amend Nevada’s constitution by requiring in-person voters to provide valid photo identification, and those voting by mail to provide a personally identifiable number — such as part of a driver’s license number or Social Security number — alongside their signature. Nevada does not require voters to provide any type of identification before voting, but voters are required to provide a signature that must match the state’s files. Understate law, petition supporters must gather and submit at least 102,362 signatures by July 8, 2024, to qualify for the 2024 ballot, with at least 25,591 signatures coming from each of the state’s four congressional districts. As a constitutional initiative, it would need to pass twice in subsequent elections (2024 and 2026) to take effect. It marks Repair the Vote’s second attempt at putting a voter ID proposal directly in front of voters, following a failed attempt with a similar ballot measure last year. At the time, ajudge orderedthe group to rewrite its “description of effect” because it was argumentative. The effort ultimately did not receive enough signatures and did not make it on the ballot. ANevada Independentpoll earlier this yearfound a majority of Nevada voters strongly supported voter ID laws, which have been a key aspect of Republicans’ electoral reform efforts. Abillpushed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo this year to enact voter ID lawsstalledin the Democratic-controlled Legislature. In an interview Thursday, Gibbs said the group had addressed the legal issues raised last year, and he derided Democrats for their opposition to voter ID laws. “Why are the Democrats so afraid of voter ID?” Gibbs said in an interview. “You’ve got to show an ID to do a lot of different things nowadays, and yet when it comes to the fundamental right of our democracy and our republic, which is voting, they’re insistent that nobody should have to prove who they are.” Bradley Schrager, one of the lawyers who brought the lawsuit, declined to comment. The secretary of state’s office, which oversees ballot petitions and was named as a defendant in the suit, also declined to comment. Last week's lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the initiative by claiming it would implicitly require a funding source. Nevada law prohibits ballot initiatives from costing money unless the measure also includes a sufficient tax or funding source to make up for the costs. The suit argues that the state would have to provide and pay for free identification cards for all Nevada voters, because requiring voters to pay for identification would be considered an implicit poll tax, which the U.S. Supreme Court hasdeemed unconstitutionalacross all American elections. Most of the identification options outlined in the initiative require some kind of payment, and those that do not are only available for certain populations. The lawsuit also said the initiative’s description of effect fails to outline the full implications of the ballot question. The 47-word description also fails to outline differing identification requirements depending on a voter’s age. Under the petition, identification for voters who are at least 70 years old could be expired for any period of time and still be accepted as valid, while other voters’ identification must not be expired by more than four years. “Independently and collectively, these omissions and misleading statements render the Petition’s description of effect legally deficient,” the lawsuit said. The lawsuit marks another legal challenge to a proposed 2024 ballot initiative. Last month, a Carson City judgetossed outan initiative filed by reproductive rights groups that aimed to place an abortion rights question on the ballot next year. The judge ruled the petition was too broad for a ballot question, would expend state funds and had a misleading description of effect.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-vegas-biden-highlights-3-billion-for-high-speed-rail-line-to-sell-nevadans-on-economy,True,"President Joe Biden in Las Vegas on Friday heralded his efforts to secure funding for themuch-anticipated commuter rail projectfrom Southern Nevada to Southern California, again emphasizing his administration’s economic policies less than one year out from the 2024 election. Biden — who met with UNLV students and administrators still reeling from a mass shooting on campus Wednesday — focused his speech on the economy, the same approach he’s taken during his campaign. He particularly highlighted theBipartisan Infrastructure Lawthat helped provide funds for the rail project and his efforts to support unions. Still, most Americansremain unhappywith Biden’s handling of the economy despite favorable job numbers and easing inflation, while other Democrats on the ballot have been more hesitant to lean into the economy. Inside a sprawling carpenter’s union training facility in central Las Vegas, Biden stood on a custom wooden stage emblazoned with “UNION STRONG.” To his left, two dozen union carpenters watched from above, lining a training scaffold; to his right, hundreds of attendees waited for hours to catch a glimpse of the president. Biden’s appearance was meant to highlight the project that had for decades been a boondoggle, along-promised, never-realizedtrain that could supplant the often congested hours-long drive between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. “Harry Reid, I told you 35 years ago I’d get this sucker done,” Biden said. “We're getting it done.” Biden flew into Vegas on Friday afternoon — en route toa fundraiser in Los Angeles— to tout more than $6 billion in federal investments for new high-speed rail projects, namely the $3 billion for the $12 billion Brightline West project aiming to connect Las Vegas to Rancho Cucamonga, outside Los Angeles, with a two-hour transit time (The remainder of the projected cost will beprivately financed). Another $3 billion will go toward fundingpart of a new rail linein California’s Central Valley that could eventually link Los Angeles and San Francisco. It’s a project lauded by the state’s congressional delegation, whose five Democrats — three U.S. House members and both senators — opened Friday’s event. Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) called the money “transformational.” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) cast it as “once-in-a-lifetime,” the culmination of lobbying efforts that stretched back to the 1990s. Even Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo was on the guest list, waiting in line to meet Biden after Air Force One landed. But Biden also came to a city again shaken by gun violence, arriving two days after a gunmankilled three UNLV faculty membersand seriously wounded another in a shooting on campus. Biden spoke just 5 miles away from the scene. Ahead of his remarks, the president met with UNLV administrators, students and families. The state’s congressional Democrats also gave their condolences to UNLV, as well as to the families oftwo state trooperskilled in a hit-and-run last week. Biden called on Congress to “step up,” calling for legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as national red flag laws that allow police or family members to petition a court to temporarily take away someone’s firearms if they are believed to be a threat to themselves or others. “Over 600 mass shootings in America this year alone, plus daily acts of gun violence that don't even make the national news,” Biden said. “This is not normal, and we can never let it become normal.” But any policy fallout after the shooting has, so far, remained muted. Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters this week that the shooter obtained the handgun used in the shooting legally, andNevada lawalready largely bans the possession of weapons on college and university campuses. On Thursday, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) referenced the shooting ina social media postthat also criticizeda maneuver by Senate Republicansto block legislation instituting an assault weapons ban and universal background checks (Nevada lawmakers expanded background checks for private gun salesin 2019). “Enough is enough,” Rosen wrote. “We need common sense gun reform.” Whither Bidenomics? For months, Biden’s campaign has sought to capitalize on economic momentum, in large part by seizing on the message of “Bidenomics” — a catch-all portmanteau that the campaign hoped would tie together high jobs numbers, falling unemployment and easing inflation. But rank-and-file Democratshave souredon the branding. Horsford, head of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus,toldPoliticoin September that the messaging erroneously centers the economy around Biden, rather than voters. On Friday, “Bidenomics” was mentioned just once by the president, as he focused on union jobs — Biden was greeted at the airport by members of the powerful Culinary Workers Union — the latest economic numbers and investments in rail expansion. He also criticized former President Donald Trump and railed against billionaires and the nation’s largest corporations. “The American people are tired of being played for suckers,” Biden said. But more broadly, Biden has yet to see a shift in voter sentiment, even as economic indicators have continued to point toward a potential “soft landing” from last year’s inflation surge. ACNN pollconducted in November found two-thirds of voters disapproved of Biden’s handling of the economy. ANew York Times/Siena polllast month also showed 59 percent of Nevada voters rating economic conditions as poor. Ahead of his visit, Biden toutedthe latest jobs reporton Friday — another 199,000 jobs added in November, dropping unemployment nationwide to 3.7 percent. Updated state-by-state unemployment rates were not yet available Friday, though Nevada maintained the nation’s highest unemployment ratein Octoberat 5.4 percent. On Friday, the Brightline West announcement became a conduit for all of the above. Biden touted 35,000 jobs expected to be created through the project, among them 10,000 union jobs. “America’s had the strongest growth and now has the lowest inflation of any major economy in the world,” Biden said. “But there's more to do. We know that prices are still too high for too many things.” Swirling around the economic projections are the looming political consequences, both for Biden and for the top-of-the-ticket races. In 2022, Biden’s underwater approval ratings — stymied in large part by souring economic concerns over surging inflation — made the presidentpersona non gratain competitive elections nationwide, among them Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s re-election tilt. Just before the 2022 election, Cortez Mastojoined former president Barack Obamafor a get-out-the-vote rally, rather than Biden. But ahead of Sen. Jacky Rosen’s re-election campaign in 2024, the senator rode with Biden on Air Force One en route to his Las Vegas speech. She (alongside the other delegation members) credited Biden and his cabinet members for securing the high-speed rail funding, calling it “historic.” “President Biden’s infrastructure law made it possible,” Rosen said. But the issue has proven fodder for her potential Republican opponents. That includes leading Republican Senate hopeful Sam Brown, whose campaign cast the federal grant as a “handout” to a “private equity billionaire.” Friday’s visit marked Biden’s second to Las Vegas this year, followinga speech in Marchwhere he trumpeted the prescription drug pricing provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. He is next set to travel to Los Angeles late Friday as part of his two-state West Coast swing, where he will hold a high-priced Hollywood fundraiser.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/what-sam-brown-has-and-hasnt-said-about-abortion-as-democratic-attacks-mount,True,"Last year, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) won re-election in the tightest U.S. Senate race in the country with campaign messaging that focused heavily on her support for abortion access while contrasting her with Republican opponent Adam Laxalt’santi-abortion positions. Now, Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) is hoping to capitalize on the same type of messaging ahead of her 2024 re-election bid. But as Nevada Democrats havetargeted the race’s Republican frontrunner, Sam Brown, over his stance on abortion, they’ve at times misrepresented his views and amplified years-old comments from a candidate who hassaid very little about the issue. That included a pair ofpress conferences across the state last weekthat saw Democratic elected officials and leaders of abortion rights groups blast Brown on abortion while standing next to a sign claiming Brown supports banning abortion, even in cases of rape or incest. Abortion is protected up to 24 weeksunder Nevada law, and is legal beyond that point to protect the life or health of the pregnant person. Though only a majority vote could overturn Nevada’s law, a national ban couldsupersedestate law and restrict access to abortion. Democrats’ attacks underscore not only Brown’s standing atop the crowded GOP primary field, but also Democrats’ belief that abortion will again prove to be a key issue for Nevada voters who strongly favor abortion protections. But what has Brown actually said about abortion? ‘Pro life’ view While Brown’s campaign — both in his 2022 U.S. Senate run that ended with a second-place finish in the primary and ongoing 2024 bid — has focused primarily on the economy and anti-Democrat messaging, he has repeatedly stated he is “pro life.” Ina statement in September, Brown said that his view on abortion was shaped by his experience in Afghanistan, where Brown suffered severe burns in an explosion while deployed as a U.S. Army captain. His campaign materials have provided little more insight into his position on abortion. In 2022, Brown’scampaign websitesaid he opposed federal funding for abortion and would support nominated U.S. Supreme Court justices who “understand the importance of protecting life.” Hiscampaign site nowhas additional information about his opposition to “late term abortion” — whichrarely takes placecompared with abortions at earlier stages of gestation — and to “abortion without parental notification.” The site also highlights Brown’s support for adoption and improving pre- and postnatal care. What about exceptions? Last week, Nevada State Democratic Party Chair and Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-North Las Vegas) claimed Brown would support an abortion ban without exceptions for rape or incest. She pointed to a2022 iVoterGuide surveylisted as filled out by Brown, saying he “stated in his own words that he opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest.” In the survey, Brown is listed as supporting abortion only in cases of “risk of life to the mother.” However, Brown’s campaign refuted that position, tellingThe Nevada Independenton Thursday that he had “no involvement with the questionnaire” and “disavows it,” adding that a junior staffer working on his prior run for office had partially filled out the survey without authorization. Brown toldThe Nevada Independentearlier this year that he supports exceptions in cases of rape, incest and a threat to the life of a mother. In astatement to KTVNlast week, Brown’s campaign described Democrats’ recent attacks as “outright lies.” Would he support a national abortion ban? Brown has notably avoided the question. In aninterviewthis summer after announcing his candidacy, Brown declined to say whether he would support or oppose a national abortion ban. He said he would not “deliberate on hypothetical legislation.” But that has not stopped Democrats from claiming that he will support such a ban. State Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) said at a press conference last week that national Republicans are “all in on Sam Brown” as a way to get “the votes that they need to bring a nationwide abortion ban to the floor of the U.S. Senate.” Backing up their statements, Nevada Democrats point to Brown’s 2014support for Texas’ then 20-week ban on abortion. At the time a state legislative candidate, Brown described the issue as “nonnegotiable” in a candidate forum. Still, Brown has largely avoided answering questions about a national abortion ban ininterviews with other media outlets. Why are these attacks happening? In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturnRoe v. Wadelast year, Democratic candidates emphasized their support for protecting abortion and outperformed expectations in the 2022 midterm elections. Voters have approved ballot measures protecting abortion even in conservative states, such asKansasandOhio. Though Nevadans voted in 1990 to protect abortion in state law — a law that can only be overturned by a majority of voters — Democratic lawmakers are pushing for aconstitutional amendment to protect abortionthat is likely to land on the 2026 general election ballot. Separately, a reproductive rights group is pursuing a similar constitutional amendment that could end up on the 2024 general election ballot, though it is currently inlegal limbo. Now as those same groups amplify the issue in the Senate race, even one Republican candidate has attacked Brown on abortion. Jeff Gunter, a dermatologist and former Trump-appointed U.S. ambassador to Iceland, said on social media hedoes not supporta national abortion ban andaccusedBrown of supporting a ban with no exceptions. Brown has done little to rebut the attacks. Abortion remains a lower priority for a candidate more outwardly focused on federal spending and the economy. But if Rosen can follow Cortez Masto’s playbook from the 2022 cycle, the issue could boost Rosen’s re-election chances in a state where voters remainstrongly in favorof abortion protections.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-polls-on-working-class-hispanic-voters-highlight-2024-battlefield,True,"In 2016, Donald Trump’s presidential victory waspoweredby the support of a constituency historically aligned with the Democratic Party — the working class. In 2020, Joe Biden defeated Trump through an electoral coalition that despite attempted Republican inroads relied heavily on Latino support — particularly in Nevada, where hewon 60 percentof the Latino vote. Since that election, winning back whiteworking class votershas remained a consistent focus for Democrats, while attracting Latino voters (outside of Florida) has becomekeyto the Republican Party’s electoral strategy. A pair of two polls recently conducted in Nevada — one focused on working class voters and the other on Hispanic voters — provides a snapshot of where these voter blocs stand this fall and outlines strategies for how to  make durable gains among these key populations ahead of a 2024 electionthat has both major parties eying Nevada. And despite the partisan leanings of the pollsters, the results indicate that Hispanic voters in Nevada continue to favor Biden and Democrats, while the working class (or voters without a college degree) as a whole continues to trust Republicans more on economic issues. NV working class voters say GOP better on economic issues The Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) commissioned aYouGovpoll that was conducted between Oct. 17 and Nov. 6 of 454 voters and has a margin of error of 6.2 percentage points. The poll found that working-class voters —nearly three-quartersof Nevadans — overwhelmingly believe that they as a group are worse off today than they were 40 years ago. Voters polled said they trusted the Republican Party more than Democrats to handle issues such as the economy, immigration, and education, each by a double-digit margin. The only issues Democrats were favored on were combating climate change and managing the clean energy transition, with the parties essentially tied on the issue of respecting democratic institutions and elections. In 2022,exit polling from CNNshowed that Republican Adam Laxalt won 50 percent of voters without a college degree to Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s 46 percent. Pollsters identified some bright spots for Democrats. Though Republicans were favored on economic issues, the poll found that culture war issues and crime do not appear to resonate with voters — strong majorities said they are concerned about politicians’ focus on banning books (59 percent expressed concern) and restricting abortion (59 percent), while issues such as banning gender transition surgeries (24 percent) and increasing police and prison funding (33 percent) garnered little support. And the poll found that Republicans’ hold on the working class is not absolute. Despite shifts to the right, 43 percent of respondents said the Republican Party represents affluent Americans’ interests, while only 29 percent said the same of Democrats. Republicans were functionally tied (40 percent )with Democrats (38 percent) on which party put working class interests first. Hispanic voters still up for grabs in Nevada Meanwhile, GOP-alignedCygnalpolled300 Hispanic voters in Nevada from Nov. 6 to Nov. 12 with a margin of error of 5.57 percentage points. The poll found Democrats maintain advantages, but there are “glimmers of opportunity” for Republicans, particularly among younger Hispanic voters, pollster John Rogers said in a statement. Trump and Biden are underwater with Hispanic voters in Nevada. Biden’s favorability is at 45 percent, while Trump is at 33 percent — though still higher than leading GOP hopefuls Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, both with favorability around 27 percent. In a head-to-head, Biden beats Trump among Hispanic voters 50.3 percent to 36.9 percent, with 12.7 percent undecided — a significant advantage, but also well behind the 60 percent he won in 2020. The poll also suggests that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former Democrat who plans to run as an independent, could be a spoiler. If Kennedy is included, he garners 15.8 percent of the Hispanic vote — and draws much more support from those who would otherwise pick Biden in a two-man race, despitenational pollingsuggesting his presence hurts Trump more. Biden’s percentage of support falls nearly eight points with Kennedy included, while Trump only loses about four points. Hispanic Nevadans listed inflation and the economy as their top concern (36.4 percent) — an issue that Republicans hoped to (butwere unable to) capitalize on in 2022 races. The issue of threats to democracy came in second at 15.6 percent — abigger concernfor Hispanics in Nevada than their counterparts in Arizona, Florida and Texas. The poll found Hispanic voters in Nevada trust Democrats more on every issue but the economy, where the parties are in a dead heat, separated by 0.1 points. Democrats have massive advantages on abortion (a nearly 35-point difference) and education (19.8 points). The poll — like recent election results — throws cold water on the notion that Hispanics will move to the Republican Party on purely social conservative merits. But based on the overlapping importance of the economy to these groups, both pollsters note the need to streamline and present an effective economic message to carry the state.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/advocates-again-push-ballot-measure-to-take-redistricting-out-of-legislatures-hands,True,"Backers of an initiative to create an independent redistricting commission for Nevada are again launching an effort to get a question on the ballot. Two initiatives were filed on Tuesday with the secretary of state’s office on behalf ofFair Maps Nevada, a group led by College of Southern Nevada professor Sondra Cosgrove, who also spearheaded the 2020 and 2022 efforts to change Nevada’s redistricting process. The petitions contain identical language and seek to remove state lawmakers’ role in the redistricting process by establishing an independent, seven-member commission to draw congressional and legislative district maps. The only difference between the two petitions is that one would require new maps to be redrawn in 2027 (the first possible year the proposed law would be in effect assuming the measure were to pass on the 2024 and 2026 ballots) and the other in 2031, which would align with the state’s usual 10-year redistricting cycle. According toBallotpedia, 10 states use commissions for congressional redistricting, and 15 use them for legislative redistricting, with the vast majority of commissions not populated by those in elected office. Advocates say that the model helps suppress partisan gerrymandering and ensures elections are fairer and more competitive. As constitutional amendments, voters will need to vote in favor of the initiatives in the 2024 and 2026 elections before the amendments could become part of the state constitution. “I am being tenacious about this, and I'm going to put it in front of the voters as many times as I possibly can,” Cosgrove said in an interview withThe Nevada IndependentThursday night. Cosgrove said the 2021 redistricting process, when Democrats held control of the Legislature and the governor’s office, resulted in maps thatheavily favoredthe Democratic Party. She cited thePrinceton Gerrymandering Project’s recently released “F” grade for partisan fairness on the state’s new congressional maps as evidence that the system needs to change, especially given the fact that registered nonpartisans are quickly growing in number. “No one in this state can look me in the eye and tell me that the maps are not gerrymandered,” said Cosgrove, who is also the executive director of the civic engagement nonprofit Vote Nevada. In 2020 and 2022, Fair Maps Nevada supported similar, nearly identical initiatives that were unsuccessful. To get an initiative or referendum on the ballot, a petitioner must obtain signatures from at least 10 percent of the voters in the previous general election — meaning that at least 102,586 signatures are needed to qualify a measure for the 2024 ballot, with at least 25,647 signatures coming from each of the state’s four congressional districts. The petitioners must collect and submit signatures by July 8, 2024, to qualify for next year’s election. If a petition receives enough signatures and a simple majority of Nevadans vote in favor of the corresponding ballot question, it would pass and be placed on the ballot again in 2026, where another affirmative vote would add the language to the state constitution. The 2020 petition waschallengedin court almost immediately after it was filed by a Las Vegas pastor with ties to state Democrats. Despitewinning a deadline extensionin federal court, difficulties with collecting signatures during a pandemic meant the groupfell well short of the signaturesneeded to qualify for the initiative. Cosgrove said she’s not worried about lawsuits derailing the measure because the initiative's language has survived past legal challenges. She said the 2022 effort failed because it was challenging to reach nonpartisan voters, and she and other supporters are working on addressing that gap. The petitions stipulate that four of the redistricting commission members would be appointed by legislative leadership and the remaining three chosen by the four appointees. Those three could not have an affiliation with either the Republican Party or Democratic Party, and at least one nonpartisan would need to support the new district maps for them to move forward. Individuals who would not be allowed on the commission include lobbyists, candidates or elected officials. In the past, the initiative received modest financial support from trade groups for real estate agents and franchised auto dealers. She said fundraising for the 2024 measure has not yet begun. Cosgrove estimated it costs about $2 million to successfully qualify a ballot initiative, which she said is “prohibitively expensive” and unfair. But “I'm just gonna keep doing it,” Cosgrove said. “I'm a historian. I know that tenacity sometimes is what you need.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/what-nevada-can-learn-from-2023-election-results-from-abortion-to-youngkin,True,"As Republican candidates across the nation have leaned on criticism of COVID policies, anti-abortion rhetoric and warnings around access to gender-affirming care in campaign messaging, the outcomes of last week's election indicate that so-called ""culture war issues"" may not be resonating with voters. In Kentucky, where President Donald Trump defeated President Joe Biden in 2020 bynearly 26 points, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won re-election. Pennsylvania voterselectedDemocrat Dan McCaffery to the state's Supreme Court after he ran a campaign focused on abortion and other rights, and Virginia Democratstook controlof the statehouse after centering abortion access in their campaigns. Nevadano longerhas off-year elections, but last week’s results may hint at some trends that could affect results in the Silver State come 2024. Here are some takeaways: Abortion remains a winning issue The decision bynearly 57 percentof Ohio voters to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution last week solidifies abortion as a winning issue for Democrats since theDobbsdecisionlast year determined that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to abortion. The win came despite more than$1.7 millionspent by the Catholic Church against the measure. A conservative state that backed Trump in 2016 and 2020, Ohio’s embrace of abortion access also indicates that the issue could spell trouble for Nevada Republican candidates. Republican political strategist Mike Slanker acknowledged the danger the issue presents during IndyFest in October saying, “Republicans who ran from [abortion] suffered from it. Republicans who dug in suffered from it.” In Nevada, legislative Democrats are hoping toharness political momentumsurrounding abortion rights througha measureto enshrine abortion protections in the Nevada constitution that will likely land on the ballot in 2026 (the Legislature passed the measure in 2023 and will need to pass it again in 2025 before it goes before voters the following year). Agroupincluding Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada and the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada is pushing aseparate effortto enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution via a 2024 ballot measure. It awaits a hearing in Carson City’s 1st Judicial District Court following a legal challenge. The ballot measure has already garnered funding from outside groups, including Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s abortion rights nonprofit, which has donated$1 million to the effort. Some have askedwhether the proposed abortion ballot question is just a push for higher turnout in 2024, given that abortions up to 24 weeks in pregnancy arealready legalunder state law. But high-ranking Democratic operative Rebecca Lambe said that isn’t true. “Of course not,” Lambe said during IndyFest. “The reality is that every single Republican who’s running in the U.S. Senate race is an extremist on abortion, on choice. So this is a really important issue. It’s not just an important issue in Nevada.” The Youngkin model doesn’t work — at least in Virginia As our colleague Sean Golonkawrotelast year, then-candidate Joe Lombardo’s focus on education followed the path of Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who rode the parents’ rights, school closures and critical race theory train to the governor’s mansion in Richmond — a theme he highlighted in a 2022rallyfor Lombardo. The “Youngkin West” comparisons don’t end there. Both men flipped governor’s mansions in states that have trended Democratic in presidential elections. Both had their ambitions stifled by the state Legislature — a Democratic supermajority in the Assembly for Lombardo and narrow Democratic control of the state Senate for Youngkin. And Youngkin’s strategy for 2023 —spending$15.1 million through his political action committee and engaging in state legislative races — has been mirrored by Lombardo, who has beenspending big through his Better Nevada PACand endorsing candidates in advance of 2024. But last Tuesday, Youngkin’s plan — seen by some as a resume builder for afuture presidential run— flopped. Virginia Democrats defended the state Senate and took back the House. Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA), who represents the suburbs outside of Washington, D.C., had a simple takeaway for Republican governors such as Lombardo trying to copy the Youngkin model. “It doesn’t always work,” he said in an interview. Beyer said Virginia Democrats successfully tied Youngkin’s supported candidates to unpopular positions, including the governor’s proposed 15-week abortion ban. “There were many things that he tried to do his first few years as governor being stopped by the Senate, which we control,” Beyer said. “So our great fear was that if he got his trifecta, that we would start to look like Florida or Texas.” Biden’s not a drag on down-ballot Dems — for now Biden’s approval rating has remained underwater formore than two yearsnationally. Only 42 percent of Nevada voters said they approved of the job the president has done in an OctoberCNN poll. But 2023 proved to be another triumphant election night for Democrats, adding to a string of successful midterms and special elections in spite of the president’s low support. Democratspicked upstate legislative seats in Virginia and New Jersey. BesheardefeatedTrump-backed Daniel Cameron in deep-red Kentucky, distancing himself from Biden while campaigning on the infrastructure policies the president has brought to the region. The successful election results andlow Biden polling numberspaint a conflicting picture for 2024. How can he be so unpopular when down-ballot candidates in his party keep winning? Will he be a drag on other candidates? At acampaign fundraiser in Chicagolast week, the president said he believes the polls have major flaws. But he previewed his strategy, saying that his policies — from allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of drugs to funding infrastructure — are popular, as proven by Kentucky’s gubernatorial election. “The press and pundits keep being surprised,” Biden said. “They can be surprised as much as they want. But since I came off the sidelines to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump, we haven’t stopped winning and he hasn’t stopped losing.” Editor’s Note: This story appears in Indy Elections, The Nevada Independent’s newsletter dedicated to comprehensive coverage of the 2024 elections.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/what-nevada-republicans-can-learn-from-washington-democrats-awkward-2016-caucus-primary-split,True,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton narrowlywonthe state-run Washington presidential primary, conducted by mail, on May 24, 2016. It didn’t matter. Two months earlier, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) hadwonthe Washington caucus with 73 percent of the vote. The time-consuming caucus had about a third of the turnout of the primary — but the state partydid not awarddelegates based on which contest had greater participation. It maintained a caucus, even though the state had been running a primary since 1989 and even after the state Republican Party transitioned to a primary by 2016. Sanders took the bulk of the state’s 101 delegates, creating anawkward realitythat spilled into the national convention, when Sanders delegatesprotestedand put tape over their mouths at the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The whole episode embarrassed the state party, which had clung to the caucus as a vestige of its power to influence outcomes. Seeing the writing on the wall, Washington Democratsabandonedthe caucus by 2020. The moot 2016 primary, meanwhile, cost the state$9 million. Sound familiar? Like Washington Democrats, Nevada Republicans have resisted a state-run primary. They’re running their own caucus, like Washington, though Nevada's is two days after the primary. But party Chairman Michael McDonald and his allies have taken a step that Washington Democrats never took — only opening the state caucus to candidates that forgo the primary. Washington’s situation in 2016 provides some analogs to the self-inflicted primary-caucus brouhaha facing the Nevada Republican Party  — a situation expected to confuse voters. In 2019, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee signed a law moving the state’s presidential primary up from May to March, hoping to increase the state’s political clout on the national scene — a similar motivation to Nevada’s2021 lawaimed at making the state the then-first primary in the nation. The state partyvoted overwhelminglyin 2019 to use the state-run primary as its nominating contest, abandoning the caucus. “I think we’ve clearly outgrown the caucus, and that is something that rank-and-file Democratic voters made clear to us,” one state committee member told PBS. While the 2016 caucus favored Sanders, the 2020 primary proved a tight fight between Sanders and eventual nominee Joe Biden. Biden won 46 delegates, while Sanders won 43. The Nevada GOP, meanwhile, is taking the opposite tack in creating a narrower contest. Many suspect that the caucus stands to benefit former President Donald Trump, who has the most politically active base among Republicans in the state. Trump has wined and dined McDonald at Mar-a-Lago and maintained a close relationship with his longtime ally, who wasa fake electorfor his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. While McDonald has maintained the contest is not rigged, hecalledTrump “the next president of the United States” at his October rally in Las Vegas. But if Washington is any indication, the ensuing voter confusion and contradictory results between the primary and caucus could lead to an outcome Nevada wanted to avoid when it first moved into the early slate for the 2008 election: irrelevance. Despite Nevada’s position as fourth in the Republican nominating calendar,onlyTrump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy visited the state before theRepublican Jewish Coalition cattle callat the end of October — prompting more headlines about the primary-caucus confusion than actual candidate visits. It mirrors what happened in Washington. With the confusing dueling contests, neither Sanders nor Clinton spent much time there, save for a major Sanders rally in August 2015. It was exactly what inspired Washington Democrats chair Tina Podlowski to shift to a primary and make the contest earlier. “We wanted to be more relevant,” Podlodowski said,accordingtoSeattle Met Magazine. Correction (Nov. 7, 2023 at 11:30 a.m.): A previous version of this article misstated when the 2016 Washington caucus was held.  It was held March 26, not May 26.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/republican-pollster-finds-rosen-with-narrow-lead-over-brown-in-senate-race,True,"A new poll of likely Nevada voters commissioned by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) shows Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) narrowly leading potential Republican challenger Sam Brown ahead of her 2024 re-election bid. In a hypothetical ballot, 45 percent of respondents said they planned to vote for Rosen while 40 percent chose Brown. Ten percent remained undecided, while 5 percent selected none of the above. The poll, which was reviewed byThe Nevada Independent, was conducted by the Tarrance Group, a Republican firm that did polling for Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s 2022 election, from Oct. 23 to 26 and has a margin of error of 4.1 percent. It overrepresented voters with a college degree relative to the population of Nevada, but pollsters said the sample’s demographics fell within the norm of its polling over the last several years, including surveys for Lombardo. Poll respondents were 32 percent registered Democrats, 30 percent registered Republicans, and 33 percent independents; through theend of September, Democrats made up over 31 percent of active voters in the state, Republicans represented nearly 29 percent, and nonpartisans at 32 percent. The poll found Brown — a retired Army captain who was nearly killed and severely burned by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan in 2008 — leads the Republican primary field, though he fell short of majority support.  A significant bloc of primary voters remain undecided, the poll found. The NRSC isbackingBrown in the primary, havingrecruitedhim to run as part of a strategy to field more competitive candidates after they failed to take the Senate in 2022. Brown previously ran for Senate last cycle, but lost in the primary to eventual nominee Adam Laxalt, and made an unsuccessful bidfor a seatin the Texas Legislature in 2014. Among registered Republicans polled, 24 percent indicated they would vote for Brown if the primary was held today. Former assemblyman and secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant, aprominent election denier, was second at 9 percent. Air Force veteranTony Gradywas third at 5 percent, and former ambassador to IcelandJeffrey Gunteronly garnered 1 percent support. But a full 41 percent of respondents remain undecided, with just over seven months until the Senate primary in June. The poll found President Joe Biden’s approval rating sits at just 38 percent, while 53 percent disapprove of his work as president. But in a Biden matchup with former President Donald Trump, the two are tied. Each candidate received 46 percent of the vote in the poll, with 2 percent undecided and 6 percent supporting an alternate candidate or the “none of the above” option that appears on Nevada ballots. A memo to the NRSC by pollsters Dave Sackett and Lauren Hutchison, which was shared withThe Nevada Independent, found a generic Senate ballot (in which respondents are asked if they will vote for a nameless Democrat or a Republican) to be a statistical dead heat, with 42 percent support for a Democrat and 41 percent for a Republican. With a year to go until the election, the memo indicates that Rosen and whichever Republican challenger emerges will need to shore up undecided voter support by boosting their name recognition and defining themselves — and each other — to the electorate. The poll found Rosen has a net positive favorability ratio among voters — 1.3 to 1 — but that 31 percent of respondents had not heard of her, with an additional 13 percent recognizing her name but lacking an impression. The memo also notes that “hard support” for Rosen lags opposition — only 28 percent of respondents said they would vote to re-elect her regardless of opponent, while 43 percent said they were committed to voting against her. Having served a term in the Senate after defeating former Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in 2018, Rosen will have an incumbency advantage despite the low name recognition against a field of Republican challengers who have never held statewide office. In the 2022 Senate election in Nevada, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), similarly a one-term incumbent at the time, defeated Laxalt by 0.8 points. Unlike Cortez Masto, Rosen will share the ballot in 2024 with Biden, meaning his support in Nevada could either be a boost or a drag on her odds to retain her seat. Biden narrowly won Nevada in 2020. His approval rating over the last year hasremainedunderwaterin Nevada, though he is running even with Trump, the likely Republican nominee, in a recentCNN poll.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lombardo-calls-nv-gop-caucus-plan-detrimental-and-unacceptable,True,"Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, criticized rules for the Nevada Republican Party’s Feb. 8 presidentialcaucusbarring candidates from participating both in the caucus and in a state-run presidentialprimarytwo days earlier, saying it is “unacceptable for the voters.” Speaking during aNevada Newsmakersinterview broadcast Tuesday, the Republican governor said thedueling contestswere “detrimental to the candidates,” adding that the situation continues “the chaos that is occurring within the Republican Party,” referring to the selection of a U.S. House speaker. Asked whether the caucus and primary would cause confusion among Republican voters, he said, “I believe it will.” “And I think it will disenfranchise a number of voters,” he added. A2021 state lawtransitioned the state from its traditional party-run caucus system and instead requires the state to hold a statewide presidential preference primary election for each major party if at least two candidates file to run in the party’s primary. But the Nevada GOP has instead opted to hold a caucus two days after the Feb. 6 primary election in Nevada. The party will use the results of the caucus to allocate the state’s presidential delegates, and has adopted rules barring candidates running in the primary from participating in the caucus. Nevada is an early nominating state for both major parties — Democrats have Nevada as the second contest after South Carolina, and the state is third in the nominating order for Republicans after Iowa and New Hampshire. State party chair Michael McDonald and the Nevada GOP havepitched the caucusas a way of implementing the “common-sense election reforms supported by” Lombardo, including requiring voter ID. “The caucus is probably the purest form of anybody who wants to get delegates — you have to put in the time in the state,” McDonald said when he announced the caucus decision. “I can push back and say, ‘Look, put your team together and come out to Nevada and start knocking some doors.'” The rules havedivided presidential contenders. Former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are among the major candidates running in the caucus, while former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) have opted to run in the primary, skipping the opportunity to win delegates in the caucus for the chance to boost their national profile in a Trump-free election. As the plans for both contests havesparked some confusionamong GOP voters, Lombardo said putting the “understanding of the process” onto voters is “unacceptable.” In an interview withThe Nevada IndependentTuesday, McDonald characterized Lombardo’s comments as a “matter of disagreement” and said his job “is to make sure we carry out the governor’s policies.” He pointed to measures such as voter ID proposed by Lombardo throughSB405, his election bill rejected by Democratic lawmakers. He added that presidential candidates running in the caucus have not expressed any issues with the format of the contest, and he said those running in the primary (Haley and Scott) are “not serious candidates,” pointing to theirsingle-digit polling numbers. Lombardo’s criticism of his own party also extended to congressional Republicans, who spent weeks trying tofind a speakerto lead the House of Representatives. “People start to get attitudes … to say, ‘Well, they can't manage themselves, why would I support them when they run as part of that party?’” he said. “So it's unfortunate. I've had numerous conversations, both with the state party and other individuals involved, and it's falling on deaf ears.” Lombardo said he doesn’t support ranked-choice voting — a proposal to allow Nevada voters to rank their top five choices rather than select a single candidate. BallotQuestion 3would implement ranked-choice voting in Nevada if passed again in 2024, and would change Nevada’s primary elections from closed to party members to open to all voters. Lombardo said he worried the process would allow a “fringe candidate” to win an election over more moderate candidates. “There's a lot of registered independents in the state of Nevada now, and they are eclipsing the numbers on the Democratic side and the Republican side,” he said. “We want their voice heard in the primary, but this proverbial jungle primary doesn't solve anything.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-rails-against-political-legal-battles-attacks-primary-rivals-in-las-vegas-rally,True,"Former President Donald Trump continued to decry his ongoing legal battles over attempts to subvert the results of the 2020 election during a freewheeling rally at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip on Saturday, while claiming that a 2024 loss would also be attributed to fraud. Saturday’s event before an estimated 1,000-person crowd at the Stoney’s Rockin’ Country was billed as a way for voters to pledge early support for Trump in Nevada’s February caucus, but Silver State issues were largely left out of Trump’s hourlong speech. Instead, he spent much of the time attacking how elections are run across the country, slamming primary opponents and calling for the end of certain gender-modification procedures. In his many off-the-cuff tangents, Trump mimed President Joe Biden as not knowing where he is, bemoaned how the words “fat pig” cannot be said anymore and saidallegationsthat Trump has enjoyed participating in “golden showers” cannot be true because he’s a germaphobe. The event marked Trump’s first campaign event since four of his co-defendants in a lawsuit brought by Georgia prosecutorspled guiltyover their efforts to overturn the results of the state’s 2020 election. In an apparent reference to their plea bargains, he referred to them as “weak people.” “These animals have been going after them for three years, they said, ‘Oh, well, let me say, let me make up a story about Trump off to do anything, just leave me alone,’” the former president said. It was also the first rally since a New York judgeimposed a $10,000 fineon him for violating a gag order in his ongoing civil fraud trial. He called Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, who is Black, a “racist” and the judge a “Trump hater.” The crowd was most engaged when Trump brought up the 2020 election. “These elections are so rigged, and we're not going to allow it to happen anymore,” Trump said. “You don't have election night anymore, you have election period. Because some of these stupid things go 48, 49 days. What do they do during those 49 [days] — they cheat.” Nevada was among the states that opted to send mail ballots to all voters during the COVID pandemic, a change that resulted in extra days needed to count ballots and call races in the state’s narrow 2020 and 2022 elections. Trump’s campaign filed multiple lawsuits in Nevada in a bid to upend a 2-point victory for Biden, in part through baseless allegations of dead voters appearing to have voted. An investigation by then- Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, foundno “evidentiary support”for such claims. Trump also touted his substantial polling lead — a polling aggregator fromFiveThirtyEightshows Trump leading in the primary polling average by 42.8 points — and in the process took repeated shots at his primary opponents. After crediting himself for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ 2018 gubernatorial victory, Trump called DeSantis “Ron DeSanctimonious.” Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was referred to by Trump as “Bird Brain.” “And I tell you, he’s dropped like a falling bird, badly injured, badly injured from the sky,” Trump said of DeSantis. “He’s gone down, and I don’t even know if he’s in second place anymore. I think somebody said that Bird Brain is now in second place.” The rally was Trump’s second campaign event in Las Vegas this year and his second speech of the day, following his appearance at theRepublican Jewish Coalition’s annual summiton Saturday morning. Before the event, campaign volunteers passed out commit-to-caucus cards for people to fill out with their contact information — a common organizing technique used by campaigns in the caucus process. There will bebotha Republican caucus and primary election in Nevada in February, but only the results of the state party-run caucus will count toward a candidate’s delegate counts. Trump is participating in the caucus, along with DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The primary will include Haley and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC). Former Vice President Mike Pence suspended his presidential campaign on Saturday morning but will still be on the primary ballot after missing the withdrawal deadline. The caucus process has been sharply criticized by some of Trump’s opponents — especially the DeSantis-backing super PAC Never Back Down — for allegedly favoring the former president. Several attendees of the rally toldThe Nevada Independentthey were unaware of the caucus and primary election differences until Saturday. Above all on Saturday, Trump described himself as a victim of a system actively trying to stop the GOP’s leading candidate from holding office. Many of his supporters agreed. “They’re trying to arrest our president,” a man before the event hollered. “Fight back.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-presidential-hopefuls-voice-support-for-israel-pence-drops-out-at-vegas-summit,True,"Las Vegas became the center of the Republican universe Saturday as most of the remaining GOP presidential primary field and top  Republicans descended on the Venetian for the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) leadership summit — an event dominated by the brewing war between Israel and Hamas. Speaking in front of more than 1,000 attendees, eight presidential candidates including former President Donald Trump, took the stage, each affirming full-throated support for Israel and denouncing pro-Palestine protests and antisemitic incidents on U.S. college campuses. Most candidates again found themselves on the fringes of a primary race that has continued to see Republican voters coalesce around Trump. One competitor — his former vice president, Mike Pence, announced the end of his primary bid at the close of his speech on Saturday — a move preceded by writing on the wall, including low polling numbers, but that still elicited audible gasps in the room. As a final message, Pence urged the assembled Republicans to choose a standard-bearer who would not give into the whims of a foreign policy dominated by populism — a warning against the America First isolationism championed by Trump. “Will Republicans continue to be the party of the traditional conservative, that has defined our movement over the last 50 years?” Pence asked. “Or will our party follow the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles?” Having missed the state's Oct. 25 withdrawal deadline, Pence will still appear on the Nevada GOP primary ballot Feb. 6, with several other longshot candidates who have opted not to participate in the party-run caucus on Feb. 8. Pence, who entered the race with a defense of his actions to thwart Trump's attempt to overturn the election, did not take the opportunity to call out the Republican frontrunner by name. Only one candidate who spoke Saturday did so — former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The RJC summit has long been a fixture of the Republican speaking circuit, especially under the sponsorship ofRepublican megadonorand casino magnateSheldon Adelson, who died in 2021. His widow, Miriam Adelson,dramatically cut back contributionsto Republican campaigns and super PACs in the 2022 midterms. Still, Adelson — a staunch Israel advocate — has been courted by top GOP presidential hopefuls includingFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantisandTrump. The aftershocks of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and ensuing preparation for an Israeli invasion of Gaza permeated the Las Vegas summit. Attendees frequently cheered during speeches, holding up pre-printed signs emblazoned with “Beat Biden!” or “I stand with Israel” or “We are not alright.” Still, no candidate made an effort to denounce instances of antisemitism within the Republican Party, including Trump’s association with Holocaust denier and white supremacist Nick Fuentes, with whom he dined last fall, or Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA) embrace of antisemitic conspiracy theories. Several candidates did call out Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), part of a vocal minority of congressional Democrats who criticize U.S. military aid to Israel. It also comes as Republicans nationwide have looked to push the Jewish electorate to the right, especially amid schisms over supporting Palestine. Jewish Americans have consistently been some of the Democratic Party’s most reliable voters — the Democratic nominee has won over two-thirds ofJewish votersin every presidential election since 1988. “There's really only one party left in America that is unabashedly pro-Israel,” Ari Fleischer, an RJC board member and former White House press secretary told reporters Saturday. “Democrats have very uncomfortable splits they are trying to navigate, and they've earned these splits because the grassroots of the Democratic Party walked away from Israel 20 years ago. And the walk has gotten faster and more furious since.” Trump, Haley and DeSantis headline speech marathon Though the RJC summit was ostensibly a platform for the eight candidates to make their case, Trump treated the event more like a rally — thanking individual supporters and looking ahead to the general election, spending no time talking about fellow Republicans and aiming his attacks at President Joe Biden. In a lengthy speech complete with diversions into the use of Jerusalem stone at the U.S. embassy in Israel, election margins in Hungary and even the movie “Silence of the Lambs”, Trump’s maintained throughout his remarks that the world was a dangerous place before and after his presidency, and that he alone can restore security. “For four straight years, I kept America safe, I kept Israel safe, and I kept the world safe,” he said. “If I were president, the attack on Israel would never, ever have happened."" Trump echoed several policy proposals embraced by his challengers, including revoking student visas for international college students involved in anti-Israel protests. He also pledged to go further, including reinstating his travel ban on Muslim countries and imposing an ideological test on immigrants to ensure support for America and Israel. Trump maintained that Jewish Americans were safer during his four years in office, saying, “We didn’t have one incident.” He did not mention that the deadliest massacre of Jews in U.S. historyoccurredin his second year in office, when a gunman murdered 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue. The former president directed the bulk of his vitriol at Hamas and Iran, but had plenty of fire for Biden, whose “weakness caused the attack on Israel.” He criticized the Biden administration for enabling pro-Palestine protests on college campuses, linking aid to Israel with other national security priorities including Ukraine, and appeasing Iran. Iran is a longtime supporter of Hamas, but as of yet there isno direct evidenceit planned or ordered Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Trump did not repeatcriticismof Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or praise for Lebanese terror group Hezbollah’s intelligence capabilities,  two assertions made previously that received pushback from both Democrats and Republicans but were only mentioned by one other candidate on the RJC stage Saturday. Painting a picture of a dangerous world without his leadership, Trump, to cheers, said Biden was bringing the nation to the brink of World War III — a reality only he could stop, if elected, with trademark braggadocio. “I reversed every single disaster Obama and Biden created, and it wasn't easy — but it was easier than I thought,” he said. With many candidates focusing on a topic DeSantis has made his calling card — attacking public education policies related to the supposed rise of ‘woke’ ideology — he doubled down on his actions in Florida to crack down on some diversity initiatives and onchapters of campus groupStudents for Justice in Palestine. “This whole thing of DEI, diversity, equity, and inclusion — that’s anti-Israel, it’s anti-Jewish, if you take that to the logical conclusion,” DeSantis said during his remarks Saturday. He added that under his administration, Florida would refuse to accept any refugees from the Gaza Strip. Hamas’ attack on Israel, he said, underscores the need for harsher policies at the U.S.-Mexico border, a policy arena that DeSantis has taken a hardline position on,promising military actionimmediately upon his election. He predicted a forthcoming terrorist attack on the U.S. would be traced to a border crossing. Haley, who hasleapfrogged other challengers in the pollsbut remains40 to 55 pointsbehind Trump, was the only candidate to call out the frontrunner by name. She criticized him forrecent commentscalling Hezbollah “very smart” and saying Netanyahu had “let us down” during Trump’s administration. She praised Trump’s administration (in which she served) for several notable pro-Israel moves, including moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, but also tried to position herself as the only candidate who could restore order to the international stage. “Eight years ago, it was good to have a leader who broke things,” Haley said. “But right now, we need a leader who also knows how to put things back together. America needs a captain who will steady the ship, not capsize it."" Haley also made a case for continued U.S. support for Ukraine, an increasingly divisive position among Republicans but one that received cheers at the RJC. Trump has said he wouldend that warby forcing the principals to agree to a land settlement, seemingly indicating he would allow Russia to retain illegally seized territory. Haley cautioned against the anti-Ukraine trend, saying Ukraine and Israel’s cases share the responsibility of fighting against a new “unholy alliance” of Russia, China and Iran. “Those who would abandon Ukraine today are at risk of abandoning Israel tomorrow,” she said, to cheers. Republican longshots jostle for attention In a program with little breathing room between the eight candidates amid back-to-back speeches, longshot challengers sought different paths. Several criticized university presidents for what they deemed moral equivocation in statements about the war, promising to cut federal funds to universities. “We have to cut out the rot of antisemitism from our society,” Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) said. “We need cultural chemotherapy to fight this cancer. To any student who is advocating for murder and terrorism, you should be expelled from the campus!” Though many promised continued aid to Israel, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, quoting Israel’s first president David Ben-Gurion, framed Israel’s creation as a tale of the Jewish state necessarily standing on its own without an impulse to rely on foreign help. Ramaswamy came under fire forrecent commentssuggesting the U.S. provide Israel with a “diplomatic Iron Dome” rather than funding, a line he repeated Saturday. Both Ramaswamy and DeSantis threw cold water on the idea of a two-state Israeli-Palestinian solution, an aim that has undergirded American policy in the region for decades. “If Israel at long last wants to abandon the myth of a two state solution, Israel should go ahead,” Ramasawmy said, also supporting a harsher Israeli stance on Qatar, where Hamas leadershipmaintains a presence, including hosting a “Red Wedding” at the Four Seasons in Doha, a “Game of Thrones” reference to a devastating massacre. And as Trump, DeSantis and Haley enjoyed multiple standing ovations, some minor candidates struggled to engage the crowd. Among them were former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a frequent Trump critic who received only scattered booing as he took the stage, and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, whose speech veered away from Israel-related issues and toward more traditional stump speech fare. Some attendees began talking amongst themselves as Burgum was speaking. GOP presidential campaigns sprawl across Las Vegas Earlier in the day at the Treasure Island hotel and casino, less than a mile north of the Venetian on the Las Vegas Strip, DeSantis attended a breakfast event hosted by the Nevada Republican Club and supportive super PAC Never Back Down — groups that have respectively criticized the Nevada Republican Party for holding a caucus even though there will be a primary election and also forchanging the rulesof the party’s Feb. 8 presidential caucus to allegedly benefit the leading candidate, Trump. That includes barring primary candidates from the caucus and prohibiting super PACs from being involved with the caucus. DeSantis ultimatelyfiledto run in the caucus alongside Trump, rather than the state-run primary on Feb. 6, despite his campaign’s similar criticisms. As Trump prepared for his own Saturday evening event in Las Vegas focused on ramping up caucus support, DeSantis implored attendees to sign “commit to caucus” cards and encouraged them to get other voters to do the same before February. In interviews withThe Nevada Independent, several Republican voters who attended the event expressed confusion over the competing elections, with some unaware that there would be both a primary and caucus. One DeSantis supporter, who identified himself only as Fred, described the situation as “ridiculous,” adding that the caucus appeared to be slanted toward Trump. At his morning event, in a conversation with hislongtime friend, former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, DeSantis placed a heavy focus on foreign policy. That included criticizing Biden for his handling of last year’s military withdrawal from Afghanistan, his approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict and his relationship with rival foreign power China. DeSantis particularly emphasizedhis viewthat China is a threat. While also hitting on familiar beats, including railing against “wokeness” and pushing for American energy independence through more natural gas production, DeSantis touted hiseffort to charter flightsfor Americans in Israel who wished to return to the U.S. following the Hamas attack earlier this month.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/dean-phillips-to-skip-nevada-primary-in-challenge-to-biden,True,"Nevada Democrats didn’t waste time Friday in criticizing newly minted presidential candidate Rep. Dean Phillips’ (D-NM) decision to downplay the Silver State’s February presidential primary in his longshot bid to challenge incumbent President Joe Biden. As the third-term congressman filed to run in the New Hampshire primary on Friday, Phillips campaign advisor Steve SchmidttoldPoliticoof Nevada’s Democratic primary: “We cede that race. Doesn’t matter.” Nevada closed its filing period for presidential primary candidates on Oct. 16. Schmidt alsotold reportersthat the campaign would prioritize contests in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan. A spokesperson for the Phillips campaign did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. The snub triggered an immediate outpouring of criticism from some of Nevada’s top Democrats. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV)wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “the path to the White House runs through Nevada — a strong, diverse, pro-union state.” “You shouldn’t run for President if you’re not going to compete for Nevada voters,” Cortez Masto said. The Nevada State Democratic Partyposted on Xthat skipping Nevada’s primary amounted to a “slap in the face to every Nevada voter.” Nevada State Democratic Party Chair and Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-North Las Vegas)wrote on Xthat Phillips was “unserious.” “By skipping out on the first in the west primary AND one of the most diverse early states, he's disregarding our working-class state and the Latino, AAPI, and Black voters who make it up,” she posted on X. That sentiment wasechoedby Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford (“clearly not a serious candidate”) and longtime Nevada Democratic operative Rebecca Lambe — an instrumental member of the state’s vaunted “Reid Machine.” “If you’re not competing in Nevada’s early primary, you’re not serious about running for President,” Lambeposted to X. Biden — whoorchestrated the shift of the Democratic nominating calendarthat prioritized South Carolina and Nevada over longtime early states Iowa and New Hampshire — has saidhe will not filefor the New Hampshire primary after the state moved toplace itself aheadon the calendar regardless. Biden filed for Nevada’s primary on Oct. 11, alongside self-help author Marianne Williamson and 11 other long-shot Democrats.",Error: Connection error.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-challenging-election-worker-protection-bill,True,"A federal district court judge on Fridaydismisseda lawsuit filed by Sigal Chattah, a prominent Republican attorney and Nevada Republican national committeewoman, seeking to blockSB406, a bill passed by the Legislature earlier this year that increased criminal penalties for harassing election workers. Judge Cristina Silva wrote that the plaintiffs — who include former poll observers from Clark and Washoe counties and far-right GOP donor and activistRobert Beadles— failed to demonstrate sufficient evidence that they would personally face a real threat of prosecution under the new law. “Plaintiffs at no point allege that they intend or plan to engage in behavior for the purpose of intimidating or coercing poll workers,” Silva wrote. Silva dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiffs have an opportunity to bring the case forward again with an amended complaint. Chattah said Tuesday she is planning to file an amended complaint, but declined to comment further. Silva granted a motion to dismiss the case from defendants Gov. Joe Lombardo, whosigned the bill into law, and Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, who pursued the legislation after making it a campaign priority to increase protections for election workers. Since the 2020 election, poll workers and election administrators across the country and in Nevada have faced increasing harassment, causing many toquit their jobs. SB406 made it a felony offense to threaten, intimidate or coerce an election worker with the intent to interfere with their performance in carrying out an election or to retaliate against them for performing their duties. Silva also refuted Chattah’s argument that the bill would have a chilling effect on the plaintiffs, who had argued the law would conflict with their ability to observe election operations and that it “may impact” their decision to engage as poll workers or observers in 2024. Silva wrote that the plaintiffs did not “actually allege that even a single one of them definitively will not participate in future elections.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/democrat-c-h-miller-resigning-from-assembly-will-run-for-las-vegas-city-council,True," Democratic Assemblyman Cameron “C.H.” Miller says he’s resigning from the Legislature to seek the Las Vegas City Council seat held by Cedric Crear, who is running for mayor. Miller, 43, shared the news withThe Nevada Independentin an interview Friday, saying his growing family and a plan to move was the motivation behind the decision. He will be the 13th lawmaker so far who is not expected to return to their legislative seat in 2025, either because of term limits, a resignation or a run for another office. The Ward 5 region includes areas of downtown Las Vegas, neighborhoods in the northwestern part of the valley and the Historic Westside, which is the subject of redevelopment through the HUNDRED Plan, also known as the Historic Urban Neighborhood Design Redevelopment plan, after decades of blight, neighborhood shrinkage and lack of investment. Ward 5 has about 113,950 people, and, according to2020 data from the Prison Policy Initiative, the region had the highest number of people in state prison — 786 compared with a low of 149 in Ward 2. Based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the average median household income in the area is $25,000 a year, or half of the city’s overall average. “I think that, uniquely, Ward 5 and the west side is poised for a great renaissance,” Miller said. “And I think the HUNDRED Plan is part of that. Obviously, there needs to be some additional conversation with [the] community on how we continue to step into that renaissance era.” He has worked as a cosmetologist and filmmaker. Hewas appointed CEO of the Urban Chamber last December. Miller — who said he isn’t afraid to go after “big interests” — won the Assembly District 7 seat in 2020 against Republican Anthony Palmer, gaining 68 percent of the vote in the mostly Democratic area. In the 2022 election cycle, Palmer challenged Miller again and lost by 27 percentage points. But he will resign, becoming thethird incumbent to vacate their seat at the statehousebefore their current term ended. He is one of four Democrats who havecome under scrutinyby a Gov. Joe Lombardo-backed PAC over his votes on “Christmas tree” legislation that benefited nonprofits including an organization he works for. “​​It's not uncommon,” he said about lawmakers voting on policy that benefits their employers. “I think that a few people want to make a very targeted attack on the folks on the other side of the aisle.” Miller said during his time at the Legislature, he believes he continuously defied the odds by sponsoring successful bills that had long-standing opposition such asAJR5, a proposed constitutional amendment that couldlegalize a Nevada-based lottery programif it passes another vote of the Legislature in 2025 and then a statewide vote. He said the policy will be in the hands of the Assembly Democratic Caucus and that he trusts they will get it across the finish line. Miller said working at the state level on sensitive issues such as the “historical” passage ofAB230— a bill he sponsored in the 2021 legislative session that requires that juveniles see a juvenile judge for certain crimes as opposed to being automatically charged as adults — prepared him for city leadership. “This was historic when it passed, because people have been trying to do it and it wasn't successful because there were interests aligned that said, ‘This isn't what we're doing,’” he said. Miller also touted his support forAB32, a bill that went after abusive tow truck operations that removed cars from apartment buildings if they weren’t registered. “We put in some consumer protections for folks whose cars were parked properly in their parking stalls,” he said. “Y'all are driving through communities at 3 o'clock in the morning towing people's cars. When you really look at it, people not having their car registered is more of a sign of financial hardship.” Updated at 1:20 p.m. on 11/27/23 to correct that Miller is the third lawmaker to resign mid-term.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/progressive-pundit-cenk-uygur-wont-appear-on-nv-primary-ballot-after-altering-form,True,"Progressive political commentator Cenk Uygur, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Turkey, attempted to file for Nevada’s Democratic presidential primary using analtered formthat crossed out the words “natural born” before “citizen” — a change that caused state officials to reject his application. Uygur’s intention to challenge President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination wasfirst reportedby reporter Ben Jacobs last week. Semafor's David Weigelreportedat the time that the founder and host of progressive news and commentary program “The Young Turks” was preparing “to file for the 2024 Nevada primary.” As of theclose of candidate filing on Monday, Biden will face off against self-help author Marianne Williamson and 12 other largely unknown candidates in the state’s February presidential primary. Uygur, who immigrated from Turkey to the U.S. in 1978, has said he believes theConstitution’s requirementsto qualify for the presidency — that a person be a “natural born Citizen” — would not disqualify him from running. Hesaidhe believed the case would end up being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. That differs from typical legal interpretations of the clause, which havedescribed itas meaning someone who was a U.S. citizen at birth without needing to go through a naturalization process. Uygur filed to run on Oct. 11, but on his declaration of candidacy, crossed out references to the Constitution’s qualifications for the presidency clause and replaced “natural born” citizen with a handwritten “naturalized” citizen. State election officials rejected the application, citingstate lawthat requires candidates to file “a declaration of candidacy in the form prescribed by the Secretary of State.” Though state officials informed Uygur’s campaign of the improper filing the following day, Uygur did not submit his candidacy forms again prior to the close of the presidential primary filing period on Monday, Oct. 16. Asked about Uygur’s candidacy and screening candidates during a call with reporters on Thursday, Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said, “As long as the application in the form that we have available is completed, and they meet all the qualifications of that form, and they fill it out appropriately, they qualify for the ballot."" Uygur, 53, ran for Congress in 2020 in California’s 25th District, finishing in fourth place overall. Uygur plans legal action to secure ballot access In an interview Friday morning, Uygur described the state’s law as “unconstitutional,” but said what happened with his filing is “exactly what we expected and, in a sense, what we want” because he wants to adjudicate the issue of his qualifications through the courts. He pointed to the14th Amendment, which describes all persons “born or naturalized” in the U.S. as citizens and protects the privileges and immunities of citizens, as the reason for his belief that he is qualified for the presidency, despite therequirementslisted in Article II. Uygur also said he was still considering which states to pursue litigation in, and declined to say for certain whether Nevada would be one of them. “Well, good news for Nevada, they were the first, so they're first, they’re batter up. So in a sense, they volunteered to get sued,” he said. Uygur emphasized that his push to qualify was a fight on behalf of the 25 million naturalized citizens in the country, who he described as being treated as “second-class citizens.” The main reason Uygur is running for president, he said, is because he believes Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee, would lose and that former president Donald Trump, who is so far polling ahead of his Republican challengers, is a “fascist.” “My mission is to get the strongest Democratic candidate against Donald Trump,” Uygur said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/at-forum-las-vegas-mayor-hopefuls-discuss-homelessness-priorities-for-first-100-days,True," At a candidate forum this week, four women aiming to win the Las Vegas mayorship in 2024 shined a light on what residents could expect from their administration if elected. For the past 24 years, the seat has been held by the same family —- starting with Oscar Goodman from 1999 to 2011 and ending with his wife, Carolyn Goodman, from 2011 to the present. Their reign mainly focused on revitalizing and expanding downtown Las Vegas. With Mayor Carolyn Goodman termed out, many people are throwing their hats in the ring including former Rep. Shelley Berkley, Nevada Equal Rights Commission Administrator Kara Jenkins, medical transportation expert Donna Miller and Las Vegas Councilwoman Victoria Seaman — who were panelists at a candidate forum inside of the East Las Vegas Library earlier this week. “There's no real ringer or somebody that everybody assumes is going to win,” said Sondra Cosgrove, the executive director of the nonprofit Vote Nevada, who helped organize the Tuesday night candidate forum with the Clark County Chamber of Commerce and Battle Born News. Among those missing from the lineup were four-year resident and political newcomer Dan Chapman, who owns a beauty manufacturing company with his wife in North Las Vegas, and Las Vegas Councilman Cedric Crear, son of the first Black doctor in Las Vegas. Crear has helped bring projects online from the HUNDRED Plan, or the Historic Urban Neighborhood Design Redevelopment Plan, which seeks to revitalize the city’s west side. Crear’s campaign didn’t immediately respond to inquiries Wednesday about his absence. The forum covered topics including economic development, cities sponsoring charter schools, homeless services and expanding the health care industry. Candidates agreed that public safety and keeping police funded was important to run a “world-class city,” and that addressing homelessness is one of the city’s major concerns, with most of the speakers suggesting that people sleeping on sidewalks hurt business and tourism. Kara Jenkins Jenkins said if she gets elected, she would launch a homeless services task force within the first 100 days that would model Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass’Inside Safe initiative, which moves people out of encampments or outdoors and into homes, motels, hotels and other facilities. She said some people will never “matriculate into society in a way that we kind of hope for them.” “Day one, we'll create a task force,” Jenkins said. “We’ll get other thought partners in collaboration with the mayor's office … we're now seeing it everywhere. It's not just downtown.” Jenkins is a political newcomer and Harvard Kennedy School alum who was appointed to the Equal Rights Commission in 2013 by then-Gov. Brian Sandoval. She hopes her bipartisanship from serving under Republican and Democratic leaders will earn her favor in the race. Her top priorities are addressing homelessness and improving wages. She said that while at the Equal Rights Commission for the past 10 years she’s been working tirelessly to ensure that residents are treated fairly. Jenkins said her administration, should she win the election, would be “inclusive, innovative and thriving.” “Let's throw out the red carpet for our [residents],” she said when speaking about her economic plans. “Let's make sure they get good paying jobs, so that they can live the lives they want to, because we do it for our guests.” Donna Miller Miller said homelessness is a complex situation to solve. She said she believes that homelessness does not mean that people are hopeless and that it is a temporary situation for many people, not a status. “It's very difficult, because if you have 50 people in a room that are homeless, there's 50 reasons why those people are in that condition,” she said. Miller is an immigrant from Romania, critical care nurse and leader of emergency medical transportation companies. If she is elected, she said she plans to build more capacity in the health care industry, keep public safety agencies funded and diversify the job market. This is her first campaign and she said she believes she is the only candidate with the expertise and knowledge required “to understand the Las Vegas Medical District’s potential,” referring to a neighborhood that includes University Medical Center, the UNLV medical school and other medical facilities. She said for the past 20 years her job has required her to make critical decisions that can mean life or death for her patients. Miller heads Reinventions Professionals, which provides emergency medical care on airplanes and helicopters and responds to crises in cities and rural areas. “I build businesses and I've worked and served this community for a long time,” Miller said. “And I did that out of passion, not because I wanted to build my resume.” Miller said during her first 100 days, she would focus on organizing community forums to hear from constituents. She said it is very important to understand how the community sees certain issues before implementing changes and that her follow-up would include creating committees to address concerns. Victoria Seaman When speaking about addressing homelessness, Seaman touted a “camping ban” that she supported on the city council. She said she is proud of the initiative and that the motivations were to keep people from “encroaching upon” people’s businesses. She said she went into flood control tunnels under Las Vegas where people live and that there are some people who don’t want help. She points to addiction and mental health issues as the root cause of the homelessness crisis. “We cannot afford to end up like other cities like Portland, Los Angeles and San Francisco, where we put a Band-Aid on the problem.” Seaman, a Republican former assemblywoman who won a city council special election in 2019 and won re-election in 2022, said in her first 100 days she would focus on government transparency and settling the Badlands golf course lawsuit. She said the legal battle has reached $240 million. The dispute started in 2018when a developer sought to build luxury homes on a Summerlin golf course near the upscale Queensridge high-rise complex. The developer’s plans were stalled by city officials after residents of the exclusive neighborhood raised concerns that high-density housing could bring down property values. “The difference between my colleagues here and me is that I'm already working on all these issues and I'm going to continue to work on them,” she said. She said over the past four years, her team has resolved nearly 3,000 constituent complaints. Her number one issue is public safety and keeping neighborhoods safe, she said, adding that she also wants to expand the economy with the tennis industry by increasing tournaments, and considering ways to build housing upwards. “I think back to when I was in the Legislature and I had the Raiders stadium in front of me,” she said. “I went back and forth and I'm so proud today that I voted for that stadium because it brought in so much economic diversity. And I am constantly meeting with folks to try to expand our tennis [industry].” Shelley Berkley Berkley leaned on a plan to build a mental health and addiction services facility to address homelessness after mentioning that $100 million of the state’s budget is expected to go towarda homelessness program. She said the answer is not simply a job opportunity or a home because of people’s serious mental health issues and opioid addiction. “This is a federal issue, a state issue, a county issue and a municipal issue,” Berkley said. “And if all of the entities in this community and this state along with the feds … aren’t working together, we will never be able to solve this problem.” Berkley, whose lengthy career included time in the Legislature, on the Board of Regents and in Congress and also scrutiny over a leaked call with her former boss Sheldon Adelson in1996and an ethics investigation2012, voluntarily left her role as CEO and senior provost of Touro University as she seeks the top seat in Las Vegas City Hall. It marks a return to campaigning after she lost a nationally watched U.S. Senate race in 2012 to Republican Dean Heller. She said the next 10 years are “going to be explosive” and that increasing the number of physicians in Las Vegas, expanding the sports and technology industry and improving transportation will take the city to the next level. Berkley said it’s crucial to elect someone who will have a “steady hand at the helm” of Las Vegas’ growth, pointing to her long history in elected office. “There is nothing that is happening in the city of Las Vegas that I'm not intimately familiar with,” she said. Berkley said her experience and knowledge will allow her to set the tone for the next four years within the first 100 days if she wins the election. She said she will “hit the ground running” by speaking with every group that works in city government, including Henderson and North Las Vegas officials. “And that's important,” Berkley said, “to make sure we're all on the same team.” Thoughts from attendees Two UNLV political science students who are members of the Young Democrats club attended the forum to learn more about each candidate. Victoria Vance, 21, who lives in North Las Vegas, said she wished candidates would have spent more time talking about housing. She said she came out to stay informed even though she can’t vote for Las Vegas mayor, but found herself somewhat underwhelmed by the candidates’ responses when it comes to wraparound services. “Even if the candidates don't support [public housing] — I would just like to hear more on how they view that,” she said. Her friend, Mack Gledhill, 22, said Jenkins stood out to them because she was young and promotes equality. Gledhill said they might vote for Jenkins but it depends on how she addresses homelessness because her comments on the matter reminded them of right-wing positions. “I would say that those concerns need to be addressed for me,” Gledhill said. “But she's still definitely a viable candidate for me to vote for.” Andrew Spinney, 31, who works in technology support and sales, said Seaman stood out as the best candidate to him because she aligned the most with his Republican politics. He also thought she spoke most confidently. “Kara Jenkins was just a little bit too focused on women and inclusivity,” he said. “That was just a little bit too much for me. And Shelley [Berkley], I just feel like that’s like voting for Nancy Pelosi.” Updated at 12:50 p.m. on 10/19/23 to clarify nature of 1996 Berkley controversy. Updated at 3:06 p.m. on 10/19/23 to reflect that Victoria Seaman won a special election in 2019 and to correct where Donna Miller works. ",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-hopefuls-split-between-primary-caucus-as-nevada-presidential-filing-comes-to-a-close,True,"Monday marked the end of candidate filing for Nevada’s 2024 presidential nominating contests, with Democratic hopefuls and some Republicans filing for the state-run primary and the bulk of top GOP candidates filing for a party-operated caucus. With the dust settled, former President Donald Trump is set to take on five competitors including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramasway in the Nevada Republican Party’s caucus on Feb. 8. But two days before the caucus, three major GOP presidential hopefuls — former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) — will appear on a statewide primary ballot (along with four long-shot presidential hopefuls). The divide comes via the Nevada GOP’s decision to hold a caucus two days after the Feb. 6 primary — and to use the results of the caucus to determine presidential delegates despite a2021 lawthat transitioned the state’s presidential nominating system from the traditional party-run caucus system to a state-run primary carried out in the same way as other state elections, including early voting and universal vote-by-mail. The state Republican Partyadopted rulesthat barred candidates running in the primary from joining the caucus. Party officials have said they are holding the caucus to maintain the traditional system and implement election rules that are not supported by the Democrat-controlled Legislature, including requiring voter ID. The decision by Haley, Pence and Scott to skip out on the caucus means missing out on an opportunity to win Nevada delegates but offers a chance to run on a ballot that does not includefront-runnerTrump — giving the trailing candidates a chance to win an early statewide preference election. Other GOP caucus participants include New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and pastor Ryan Binkley. While Trump remains broadly popular among Nevada Republicans — a recentCNNpollof likely GOP caucusgoers found 65 percent supported Trump — DeSantis and Ramaswamy’s campaigns said their decision to run in the caucus was motivated by a desire to win delegates needed to become the party’s nominee. Nevada’s 26 delegates represent about 1 percent of the national total of an estimated 2,467 delegates. Across the aisle, in the Democratic primary, President Joe Biden filed to run as he pursues re-election. He’ll face off against self-help author Marianne Williamson and 11 other little-known candidates in the state-run primary.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-battleground-democrats-outraise-congressional-gop-opponents-in-third-quarter,True,"With the 2024 general election more than a year away, Nevada’s congressional Democrats maintained their significant fundraising advantages during the third quarter, headlined by Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) raisingmore than $2.7 millionover the three-month period. Rosen and the state’s three Democratic U.S. House incumbents continue to rake in cash as they prepare to stave off Republican challengers looking to loosen Democrats’ grip on Nevada’s competitive congressional seats. Both Rosen and her best-funded challenger, veteran Sam Brown,landed in the top 30for third quarter fundraising around the country; Rosen landing at 15th, and Brown in 29th, with more than $1.1 million raised. The rest of the group was led by Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), who — despite typically being outraised by fellow Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) — brought in more than $731,000 from July through September, a state record for a House race during a non-election year third quarter. While several Nevada congressional seats are considered less competitive than in recent election cycles, national Republican groups are eager to flip Rosen’s seat in the narrowly divided U.S. Senate, while Lee and Horsford are in competitive districts that national Democrats are looking to protect. The nonpartisanCook Political Reportrates theSenate raceandLee’s raceas “lean Democrat.” The only incumbent to be outraised by an opponent was Rep. Dina Titus, (D-NV) who saw a Republican opponent, Flemming Larsen, loan his campaign $200,000 of his own funds in the third quarter. Titus reported raising just over $122,000 in the quarter. Campaigns were required to report their third quarter finance activity to the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) by Sunday. Read highlights from the quarter below. The totals have been rounded to the nearest $100. U.S. Senate Sen. Jacky Rosen (D) Nearly one-third of Rosen’s fundraising ($829,000) came from small-dollar donors. These “unitemized” contributions refer to donations of less than $200, and campaigns do not have to report the names of these donors. She also raked in money from major donors, including $242,000 from political committees representing a broad range of interests from teachers and laborers to the pharmaceutical industry. Another $577,000 came from other committees that fundraise for Rosen’s campaign. Her $8.8 million in the bank is about a half-million dollars more than what Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) had at the same point in her re-election bid two years ago. Rosen’s cash balance is more than nine times greater than her closest Republican opponent, Brown. Sam Brown (R) The retired U.S. Army captain has the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC). After Brown lost last year in the Republican primary for Senate, that national support is proving to be a fundraising boon for Brown’s repeat run as he brought in nearly $1.2 million during the third quarter — putting him well ahead of other GOP primary hopefuls in the race. But to compete with Rosen, he’ll likely count on outside spending from political groups, such as the NRSC and the pro-Brown super PAC Duty First Nevada. Duty First Nevada has already reported spending more than $500,000 on pro-Brown advertising, and hasraised $2 millionfrom software billionaire David Duffield. Jeff Gunter (R) Gunter, a dermatologist with a large multistate private medical practice and a former Trump-appointed U.S. ambassador to Iceland, raised most of his campaign cash through loaning his campaign $225,000. But Gunter also brought in small-donor contributions ($94,000) and money from larger individual donors ($94,000) after launching his campaign in August. While Gunter’s largest expenses came from text and mail services to boost fundraising, he also reported spending about $1,000 on advertising. Gunter’s campaign recently released anadportraying himself as a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, and attacking Brown as anti-Trump. Tony Grady (R) Fundraising for Grady — a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel who finished second in the lieutenant governor primary last year — came entirely from individual donations, including $6,600 from people with the last name “Grady” in Tennessee. His spending has gone mostly to consulting firms. Jim Marchant (R) What a difference a quarter makes. Marchant, a former state assemblyman and most recently a GOP secretary of state candidate,led the Republican fieldin fundraising at the end of the second quarter, albeit behind Rosen by more than $2.5 million. Now, after the launch of several other Senate campaigns this summer, Marchant sits in fourth in fundraising among Republican candidates. All of Marchant’s fundraising came from 52 individual donors this quarter. The majority of his spending was to consultants and for mailing lists. No other candidates, including four other Republican Senate challengers, reported significant fundraising activity during the third quarter. The FEC requires candidates to file a report if their fundraising or spending exceeds $5,000. Congressional District 4 Rep. Steven Horsford (D) Horsford, with a national profile as the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, had the strongest fundraising quarter of any House candidate in Nevada. He handily outraised challenger David Flippo and his other announced challenger, former North Las Vegas mayor John Lee, launched his campaign late enough that he doesn’t have to file a third-quarter report. Horsford’s team went on a major fundraising swing this summer, according to his FEC filings, with stays in Martha's Vineyard, New Orleans, Biloxi, Birmingham, New York, Nashville, Boston, Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas. This quarter was his best yet of this election cycle. David Flippo (R) Flippo’s campaign substantially lags Horsford’s in fundraising, and his campaign’s costs — including payments to consultants — outpace his fundraising. The Air Force veteran donated $30,000 to his campaign this cycle. Congressional District 3 Rep. Susie Lee (D) Lee had aslightly slowerfundraising quarter than her previous one, in which she raised more than $582,000. But she retains a major cash on hand advantage compared with her two opponents in a district that had one of the country’smost expensiveraces in 2022. Atthis pointlast cycle, Lee raised over $660,000 in the third quarter and had over $1.44 million on hand. Heidi Kasama (R) Kasama, an assemblywoman wholaunchedher campaign in late August, had a little over a month to fundraise this quarter. Of the over $300,000 she reported raising, $200,000 came from a loan to herself. She did get $5,000 from her colleague Assemblyman Toby Yurek’s (R-Henderson) wife Carrie, and $1,000 from Assemblyman Brian Hibbitts (R-Las Vegas). And, having received the endorsement of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), she has taken advantage of Republicans’ WinRed digital fundraising platform, with nearly $26,000 coming from donors using the site. Drew Johnson (R) Johnson, a policy analyst, spent more than he raised this quarter. The bulk of his contributions — more than $28,500 — came via the WinRed platform. He’s spending on consulting from Axiom Strategies, a national Republican firm founded by a former Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) campaign manager. Elizabeth Helgelien (R) Former state Sen. Helgelien’s fundraising came mainly from donations of between $250 and $1,000 from individuals around the country, and through WinRed. She has also been paying for Las Vegas-based McShane LLC’s consulting services, and gave $250 to Marchant’s senatorial campaign. Congressional District 1 Rep. Dina Titus (D) Titus’ low fundraising totals have continued apatternfor her this cycle; last quarter, she raised just over $183,000. In a district on the National Republican Campaign Committee’sTarget List, she landed onNational Journal’s “Retirement Watch” list. Her fundraising total wassecond-worstamong Republican-targeted seats. Titus’ campaign said she’s not planning on retiring. “She will be seeking re-election and will have the campaign funds necessary to be successful,” a campaign spokesperson said. Titus received $4,000 from Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ (D-NY) campaign fund, and the bulk of her contributions came from various PACs. At this pointlast cycle, she had nearly $605,000 in cash on hand and raised $196,000 in the third quarter. Flemming Larsen (R) Larsen, a restaurateur, is mostly self-financed. He loaned his campaign $200,000 this quarter, bringing his personal giving total for the cycle to more than $850,000. Larsensaidhis fundraising for the quarter totaled $92,000 when combined with donations to a political action committee (PAC) associated with him, which is yet to file its report. Mark Robertson (R) Robertson, the retired Army colonel who lost to Titus in 2022, loaned $12,700 to his campaign this cycle. His leadership PAC transferred over another $6,600. The rest came from 21 individual donors in Nevada, Utah, and Washington. Titus beat Robertson in 2022 by 5.6 points. Congressional District 2 Rep. Mark Amodei (R) Amodei, who has yet to draw a challenger in his safe Republican district, raised money from a number of Northern Nevada-based individuals and PACs this quarter, including from NV Energy and Red Rock Resorts. Amodei’s campaign donated $15,000 to Friends of the Nevada State Railroad Museum, which helps preserve rail history in Carson City, $2,200 to Reno’s Nevada Military Support Alliance, and $1,000 to anti-abortion group Nevada Right to Life. He also donated to two House candidates — Celeste Maloy, the Republican nominee to replace retired Utah Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT), and Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), running for re-election in a suburban district that supported Biden in 2020. His campaign also owes $9,000 to two Republican public affairs firms in Virginia and California.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/desantis-joins-nevada-republican-caucus-haley-has-not-filed-yet,True,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has filed to run in the Nevada Republican Party’s presidential caucus, his campaigntoldTheNew York Timesin a story published Sunday. His decision to skip out on the state-run presidential primary will allow DeSantis to win delegates in the party-run caucus, depending on how he performs in a contest that also includes former President Donald Trump. A campaign spokesperson toldTheNew York Timesthat “DeSantis is committed to earning every single delegate available.” Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley intends to file for the state-run primary,NBC News’Natasha Koreckireported. Haley’s decision will leave her unable to win any delegates in Nevada, but could allow her to win a statewide presidential nominating contest that does not include Trump and DeSantis on the ballot. A 2021state lawpassed with Democratic and some Republican support requires Nevada to hold a presidential primary election if more than two candidates file to run with the secretary of state’s office. Though the Nevada Republican Party plans to allocate delegates via results of the caucus (which will be held two days after the primary in February), some candidates have nonetheless opted to file for the Trump-free primary. The filing periods for the caucus and primary both end Monday. That marks an extension for the caucus, after the Nevada GOP originally set Sunday as the close of the filing period, Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald toldThe Nevada Independent. State GOP leaders have sought to pressure candidates to enter the party-run caucus and eschew the state-run primary. That includesadopting rulesthat prevent any candidate filing in the caucus from also filing in the primary, as well as limiting delegate allocation only to candidates in the caucus. The pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC has also sharplycriticizedrules adopted by the Nevada GOP that would exclude PACs from engaging in electioneering during the caucus itself, a rule PAC spokespeople have charged is designed to hamper Trump opponents. At the end of August, Never Back Down ended its door-knocking operations in Nevada,NBC Newsreported. Other major candidates have split on whether to chance the primary or commit to the caucus. Trump committed to the caucus process early, amidmedia reportsthat his campaign was behind the push to box out DeSantis’ super PAC. He joins entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and DeSantis. Former Vice President Mike Pence, however,becamethe first major candidate to opt for the primary on Thursday. He was followed shortly after by Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC). Both candidates have seen their campaigns sputter into the fall, with particular struggles for Pence, who hasstruggled to fundraisefor two consecutive quarters amidballooning campaign debt.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/tim-scott-files-for-nevada-presidential-primary-is-2nd-major-candidate-to-skip-gop-caucus,True,"Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) filed Friday to run in Nevada’s presidential primary this February, becoming the second major Republican candidate to skip out on the Nevada GOP’s party-run caucus. Other top Republican candidates, most notably former President Donald Trump, are instead running in the caucus, which the Nevada Republican Party has opted to hold as an alternative to the state-run primarymandated by a 2021 state law. The party is barring candidates running in the primary from participating in the caucus. The Nevada GOP plans to use the results of the caucus to allocate delegates for the Republican nominating convention, meaning Scott and former Vice President Mike Pence, who alsofiled to run in the primary, will be ineligible to win delegates. However, some longshot candidates are still eschewing the state-run primary in favor of the caucus. Hours later on Friday, the state Republican Party announced that former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — an outspoken Trump critic — had opted to file for the caucus, becoming the fourth major candidate to do so. Despite skipping out on an opportunity to win delegates, running in the primary could provide Scott, Pence and other candidates with an opportunity to win a statewide presidential nominating contest that does not include Trump on the ballot. The contests — which will occur just days apart, with the primary held Feb. 6 and the caucus held Feb. 8 — have sparked confusion among Republican voters. The divide between them has been further sharpened by the decisions of big-name GOP candidates, who will be split between the two ballots. Among those polling at about 1 percent or more, according toFiveThirtyEight’s polling average, candidates in first place (Trump), third (biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy), sixth (Christie) and eighth (North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum) have filed for the caucus. The candidates in fifth place (Pence) and seventh (Scott) in polling have filed for the primary. The candidates polling in second place (Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis) and fourth (former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley) have not yet filed for either.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-north-las-vegas-vice-president-kamala-harris-looks-to-woo-young-voters,True,"Amid an early presidential re-election contest that has tested anunpopular Biden White House, Vice President Kamala Harris had a simple message she repeated five times to a crowd of college students in North Las Vegas on Thursday: “Elections matter.” Young voters, she said, delivered the White House for Joe Biden. But, she added, abortion, gun violence and climate change are still on the ballot in 2024. “You are the generation that has only known the climate crisis,” Harris said. “You are a generation that saw George Floyd be murdered. You are a generation that … will have fewer rights than your mothers or grandmothers.” Harris’ visit to the College of Southern Nevada (CSN) comes as part of a nationwide “Fight for our Freedoms College Tour,” a series of campus events aimed at young voters and concentrated so far in a handful swing states — including Nevada, Arizona and Georgia — and states with elections this year, such as Virginia. Those visits have also been tailored to heavily Black and Hispanic public institutions. On Thursday, Harris again directly credited young voters with Joe Biden’s victory — drawing whoops and applause when she jokingly repeated a line that is now ameme: “We did it Joe.” Amid “an intentional and full-on attack against so many hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights, I also want to remind you, it doesn't have to be this way,” she said. “And when you all start voting in your numbers, I know it won't be.” But Biden’s approval rating with young voters has remained especially volatile over the last year. AYouGov tracking poll, for instance, found that support peaked among respondents younger than 30 in May at 65 percent before cratering to 45 percent in September. More broadly, the electorate has split on a likely rematch of Biden and former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election, with early polls showing the pair well within the margin of error as Democrats haveratcheted up internal concernsoverthe president’s age. That includes a Nevada poll released this week byCNN/SSRS that found Biden leading Trump 46 percent to 45 percent. At CSN’s Horn Theater, the several hundred students inside — many of them women and students of color — had the energy of a rally, including raucous opening performances from a West African dance and step team and a championship-winning mariachi band. Some students had small paper pom-poms they waved throughout the program, which also included several breaks for the crowd to get up and dance. Harris’ message also came with indirect criticism of Republicans. She decried “powerful forces” making it more difficult for people to vote, in part by restricting early and absentee voting in other states. She hammered Republicans — without ever naming the party — on gun violence, abortion and LGBTQ+ issues. “I asked my team to make a Venn diagram — from which states are we seeing attacks on LGBTQ rights, attacks on voting rights and attacks on reproductive freedom?” Harris said. “There was a significant overlap.” She also touted the administration’s investment in climate initiatives and railed against efforts to undermine diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives more broadly. But Harris' visit also comes as the Biden administration’s efforts to ease the cost of college for student borrowers have hit roadblocks. The Supreme Court in Junerejecteda sweeping student debt cancellation plan, a move that pushed the White House to instead pursuea federal regulatory processthat would allow the secretary of education to cancel certain student loans. Meanwhile, a yearslong student loan repayment pause triggered by the pandemic isset to end this month, with interest already accruing on those loans as of September. Harris touted the administration’s original move — aimed at forgiving debt for low-income Pell Grant recipients — but acknowledged that “we still have more to do there.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/pence-skips-nevada-gop-caucus-becomes-first-major-candidate-to-file-for-state-run-primary,True,"Former Vice President Mike Pence filed Thursday to run in Nevada’s presidential primary, opting not to participate in the Nevada Republican Party’s caucus — and with it, skipping out on an opportunity to win any Nevada delegates at the Republican National Convention. Pence’s decision comes as several other high-profile candidates, most notably former President Donald Trump, have filed to run in the caucus, which will occur two days after the end of voting in the primary on Feb. 8. Still, running in the primary instead of the caucus could provide Pence with an opportunity to garner attention for a victory in a statewide presidential nominating contest that does not include Trump, the faraway GOP front-runner, on the ballot. The Nevada Republican Party has barred candidates who file to run in the primary from running in the caucus and is charging a $55,000 caucus filing fee —rulesthat have beenblastedby Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, as an attempt to rig the system to favor Trump. The former vice president’s decision to skip the caucus means he will not be eligible to win Nevada delegates, which will be awarded based on the results of the caucus and will be used to determine the party’s presidential nominee at the Republican National Convention this summer. Nevada’s delegates represent about 1 percent of the total pool of national delegates. Though the Nevada Republican Party intends to award delegates based on the results of the caucus, a state law passed in 2021 requires the secretary of state to hold a statewide presidential primary election if more than two candidates file to run. Pence, as of Thursday, is the fourth Republican presidential candidate to file to run in the primary (alongside John Anthony Castro, Hirsh Singh and Heath Fulkerson). Candidates who have filed to run in the caucus as of Thursday include Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Filing for the party-run caucus closes Sunday, Oct. 15, while filing for the state-run primary closes Monday, Oct. 16. In Republican presidential primary polls, Pence has generally laggedfar behind Trump, as the former president has maintained anample leadover the field. A recentCNNpollof Nevada voters conducted by research firm SSRS found that 65 percent of likely GOP caucusgoers would support Trump, followed by 13 percent for DeSantis and 3 percent for Pence, who was in a distant fifth place. Pence is the first major Republican candidate to file for the primary, though as of Thursday, several bigger names, including DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, have not yet filed for either contest. Compared with other early states, New Hampshire and Iowa, Nevada has taken a back seat in the presidential race.

Jacky Rosen’s (D-NV) campaign will report having $8.8 million on hand after the third quarter of fundraising in 2023 came to a close, giving her a state record haul for this point in the cycle, according to her campaign. Rosen raised $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 (a three-month period covering July to September),tyingthe second quarter to be her best fundraising period thus far. Over the past 12 months, she has raised $9.3 million for her re-election bid. Her campaign did not disclose how much she spent during the quarter. Those spending details on more information on her donors will be released by Oct. 15, the Federal Election Commission’s campaign finance deadline for the third quarter. Rosen’s third quarter fundraising slightly lagged efforts by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), whoraised$3.15 million from July to September 2021 ahead of her 2022 re-election. But she has more money in the bank than Cortez Masto, who had a war chest of $8.3 million at this point in her election cycle. Rosen’s total this cycle is in the neighborhood of other Democrats in bigger states who have already announced their third quarter totals. Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), running for an open Senate seat in Michigan,raised$2.98 million, while Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA)announceda $3.2 million haul.

While Brown has not released his fundraising totals, Duty First Nevada PAC, the super PAC supporting Brown,announced$2 million in donations this quarter from software billionaire David Duffield. Rosen’s campaign said over half of donations to the first-term senator this quarter were from first-time donors, and that 97 percent of donations were less than $100.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/tracker-whos-running-in-nevadas-2024-presidential-primaries-and-caucus,True,"In February, Nevada Democrats and Republicans will vote for presidential candidates running to be their party’s nominee on the 2024 general election ballot. The filing period for the state-run presidential preference primaries began Monday, Oct. 2, and candidates have two weeks, until Oct. 16, to file their candidacy for either the Democratic or Republican primary. If two or more candidates from a major political party file to run, the state is required to hold a primary for that party on the first Tuesday in February of a presidential election year, which will fall on Feb. 6 in 2024. A primary will not be held only if one or zero candidates file to run — though with two candidates of each party already filed, this would only happen if candidates withdraw from the ballot. But drawing some candidates away from the primary filing is the Nevada Republican Party’s planned presidential caucus, which is set for Feb. 8, two days after the primaries. The party will use the results of the caucus, and not the primary, to determine how it will award the state’s presidential delegates at the Republican nominating convention. The Nevada GOP is charging a ballot access fee of $55,000 and barring candidates from participating in both elections, meaning some candidates — most notably former President Donald Trump — are set to run in the Republican caucus, rather than the primary. Filing for the Republican caucus began Sept. 1 and runs until Oct. 15, according to theNevada GOP. Read hereto learn more about the primaries and caucus.

Lee spent more than nine years as mayor of the state’s fourth most populous city before mounting an unsuccessful bid for governor last year that saw him finish fourth in the Republican primary with 7.8 percent of the vote. “Just as I revitalized North Las Vegas, I'm committed to using the same expertise and conservative principles to rescue our country from the economic challenges we're facing,” Lee said in a statement Monday.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-las-vegas-vivek-ramaswamy-campaigns-under-trumps-shadow,True,"Vivek Ramaswamy — only the third major Republican presidential hopeful to visit Nevada this cycle ahead of February’s first-in-the-West caucus — took a belligerent tone during a Las Vegas stump speech Sunday, describing his campaign as “a war.” That “war,” he said, was between those who “who believe in the founding ideals of the American Revolution” and those who subscribe to identity politics, to notions of structural racism, adding that “we have to flog ourselves for our modern way of life and stop burning carbon.” “We are at war in this country,” Ramaswamy said. “And you can't win a war unless you first know that you're in one.” Ramaswamy has mounted an insurgent campaign this year as a political outsider, a pharmaceutical industry entrepreneur who has built his message around reshaping the federal government and following in former President Donald Trump’s footsteps. But standing before a banner emblazoned with his campaign slogan — “TRUTH. Vote Vivek” — at a honky-tonk bar south of the Las Vegas Strip, Ramaswamy could not shake the primacy of Trump’s dominance in the GOP primary — even before he took the stage. “Vivek is the only guy who acknowledges what Trump has done for America,” Wayne Allyn Root, a conservative radio host and former newspaper columnist who has oftentraded in conspiracies, told the crowd, after imploring them to applaud Trump’s presidency — “Let's have a little hand for the guy that did so much for America.” “[Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald] is a Trump guy, and I'm a Trump guy and we're both here with Vivek,” Root added. “That's how much we really think of this guy.” Root later suggested Ramaswamy could be Trump’s ideal vice president, a ticket to bring young people, women, minorities and highly educated voters back to the GOP fold. Ramaswamy, taking the stage immediately after Root, clarified he was, indeed, running for president. “You want to win this war, we have to take somebody who has not yet been wounded by it already,” Ramaswamy said, arguing to voters why they should pick his campaign over Trump’s. “That will take a leader with fresh legs.” Though he has risen toward the top of a crowded GOP field, Ramaswamy remains far below Trump in early polls. AFiveThirtyEightpoll aggregatorshows him nationally trailing Trump (54.8 percentage points) and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (13.5 points) in a distant third place with 6.6 percentage points on average, where he is functionally tied with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (6.5 points). On policy, Ramaswamy has called for a vast reduction of federal agencies, promising “mass layoffs” for the federal government through the elimination of five agencies, including the Department of Education and FBI. That promise would reduce the federal government’s workforce by roughly 75 percent. He has also called for the use ofmilitary force to combat drug traffickers in Mexicoin a bid to close a border he has derided as “Swiss cheese,” and has routinely criticized the Chinese government. On Sunday, he mentioned China 25 times. “They understand this game far more deeply than any of us do,” Ramaswamy said. “What China realized is alright, if these anti-American Americans are having that much traction and success already, on their own homeland, boy, we can get them to work for us.” In the second Republican debate, however, Ramaswamy frequently came under attack from other candidates on that very issue. That included pointing out hisformer business links to China(Roivant, a company he founded, once had a Chinese subsidiary that has since wound down), and Ramaswamy’s more recentembrace of TikTok— which has come amidbipartisan criticismof the social media platform’s parent company’s links to the Chinese government. Born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, Ramaswamy received his biology degree from Harvard and law degree from Yale before founding the biotechnology company Roivant. He has since cut a public figure as a crusader against “woke” corporations, including publishing a book called “Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.” At just 38, Ramaswamy is by far the youngest candidate in the field. However, after seeing a small boost in early national polls following an intensive campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire, Ramaswamy has seen polling falter slightly following the first two GOP primary debates (sans Trump). Sunday’s rally drew roughly 200 people, even amid the counterprogramming of NFL football and a concurrent Raiders away game. It also came on the anniversary of the 1 October shooting, which drew a moment of silence during Root’s introduction but was not mentioned again during Ramaswamy’s remarks. His visit comes as other Republican candidates primary have otherwise ignored Nevada — the third contest on the GOP nominating calendar — in favor of early contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. The relative lull in attention coincides with a raft of national campaigns that have signaled wariness over the Nevada State Republican Party’sdecision to hold a caucus, rather than the statutorily created primary. Party leaders have hailed the move as a bid to hold an election by party rules — including the use of voter ID, paper ballots and no same-day voter registration. But it has also come with stringent additional rules for candidates, who must also pay a $55,000 participation fee and agree not to participate in the state-run primary election. Some candidates and PACs, especially the DeSantis-linked Never Back Down super PAC, have criticized the rules as a bid to favor Trump. An official with Never Back Down toldThe Nevada Independentlast monththat the process was “rigged” to favor Trump. Ramaswamy was the first candidate to announce his participation in the caucus. Since then, the Trump campaign has signaled it is “committed” to the caucus, according to a report from theAssociated Press, but has not announced any formal filing. However, if at least two candidates file for the state-run Republican primary, it will move forwardalongside the caucus. Filing for that primary opens Monday, and runs through Oct. 16, though it remains unclear if — or how many — Republican challengers might opt for either the caucus or the primary.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-adopts-rules-for-presidential-primaries-as-state-gop-continues-plans-for-caucus,True,"Nevada lawmakers approved a set of regulations Thursday aiming at setting the stage for the state’s February presidential primary election. But on the Republican side, an unanswered question remains — will there even be a presidential primary election? Even as members of the Legislative Commission approved a wide swath of election regulations (including one placing rules on counties that wish tohand count ballots) proposed by the secretary of state’s office aimed at clearing logistical hurdles for the February presidential primary election, the Nevada Republican Partyhas optedto move forward with a party-run caucus instead, one that will automaticallyexclude any candidate who files to run in the primary. The intraparty debate has led to questions of whether the minimum two Republican candidates required to hold the primary in the first place will file once the presidential filing period opens on Monday. Under state law, the secretary of state must conduct a primary election if at least two presidential candidates file to run — even though the state GOP has said it will only award delegates to candidates who participate in the caucus. At a meeting of the state’s Advisory Committee on Participatory Democracy (ACPD) on Thursday, Deputy Secretary of State for Elections Mark Wlaschin said at least five candidates had already made appointments with the secretary of state’s office to file for the February primary. Wlaschin did not say how many of those candidates were Democrats and how many were Republicans. However, a spokesperson for the secretary of state's office sent the names of those candidates who have made appointments toThe Nevada Independentlate Thursday. They included no high-profile candidates for either major party, save Marianne Williamson, a longshot Democratic challenger to President Joe Biden. Also on the list of appointments were John Anthony Castro, a Republicanwho is suingto exclude former president Donald Trump from the ballot under the 14th Amendment; Armando Perez-Serrato, a Democrat from California who received 0.6 percent of the vote in the state’s 2022 gubernatorial primary; Heath Fulkerson, a Reno man and Republican whose campaign website says that he is running for president and “House of Representatives”; and David Stuckenberg, a former State Department official under Trump who does not appear to have an active online campaign presence. The five appointments does not guarantee those candidates will ultimately file, and additional candidates may file within the two-week filing period by mail. However, should two candidates from a major party file for the presidential preference primary, under law that primary will move forward. He added that the state had no law potentially barring voters from participating in both the primary and the caucus, likely leaving any potential limitations on dual voting up to the state GOP. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat, demurred when asked if the GOP rules on candidate participation might lower potential voter turnout. “That's not for me to decide; I'm here to implement the rules and follow the rules and follow the law,” he said. However, Aguilar also said that the state GOP should have “ideally” discussed plans for its caucus with his office “probably a little bit earlier.” “Given the caucus and the primary, the ideal situation would have been for the Republican Party to come to the secretary of state's office and say, ‘Look, this is what we plan to do during the ‘24 election; let's figure out how to work together to make sure that we're serving the best interest of voters,” Aguilar said. “... That would have been the ideal situation, but obviously we're not there now. And so we have to figure out how we serve the best interests of the voter.” The Republican National Committee opposed three new regulations that the secretary of state’s office proposed this month, arguing they could erode existing election safeguards. Those rules would make changes to how the public can observe handling of mail ballots, amend processes on election equipment information and regulate public viewing of recounts. Assemblyman Rich DeLong (R-Reno) voted against a regulation Thursday that limits participants in presidential primaries to those registered with a major party. “I am also personally not in favor of having this primary. I'd rather have a caucus and for those reasons, I'm voting no,” DeLong said. One presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy, has already filed for the caucus, with former President Donald Trumpcommitted to file soon. Other candidates and their campaigns have criticized the process, including a spokesperson for a Super PAC linked to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who toldThe Nevada Independentthat the process was “rigged” to favor Trump, in part by limiting the participation of PACs on the day of the caucus. Hand counting ballots and other regulations Legislators also approved a regulation Thursday that allows — but places limits on — hand counting ballots, a rule that has drawn pushback from the state Republican Party and voting rights groups. The regulation lays out the requirements for local governments that are only planning to count ballots by hand; however, according to a statement from the secretary of state's office, no Nevada county has plans to do so. More than a dozen people expressed their opposition to the hand-counting method Thursday, citing itshigher error ratesand potential for dissuading voters, while several Republicans at the meeting argued it was a key way to safeguard elections from fraud. Fraud related to electronic voting machines has beenwidely discredited. Ultimately, members of the state’s Legislative Commission — a group of 12 state legislators, seven Democrats and five Republicans — approved the hand-counting regulation 8-4. All Republicans opposed the measure, with the exception of termed-out Sen. Scott Hammond (R-Las Vegas). Hand counting ballots is already legal in Nevada, but Wlaschin said the regulation adds additional requirements for jurisdictions where hand counting is the only form of vote tabulation. Under the regulations, local governments that rely on a hand count must submit plans 90 days before the election that include the procedures, location, equipment, personnel, security and contingency plans to meet election deadlines. Nye County, whose clerk is a strong proponent of hand counting and previously pushedvoting machine conspiracy theories, has pledged to use mechanical voting as its primary method in next year’s elections, according to Aguilar’s statement. Nye County also plans to comply with the regulations even though its primary tabulation method will not be by hand, the statement said. The hand-counting process has become a contentious political topic in Nevada. Republicans argue the process is a key way to ensure election security and that the state should loosen regulations on the practice. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed abillthis year that would have banned the method. “Voter confidence in the legitimacy of the last presidential election is lower than any other presidential election in modern history,” read a letter from Caroline Smith, president of the Nevada Federation of Republican Women. “Please don’t limit hand counting ballots.” Meanwhile, some voter advocacy groups have expressed concern that hand counting could increase potential for election insecurity and increase wariness from voters. “We are deeply concerned about hand counting in general, as it is rooted in unfounded claims about election fraud and does undermine the integrity of elections,” said Sadmira Ramic, voting rights attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union Nevada. However, Nevada law considers hand counting legal, and the Legislative Commission has no power to unilaterally change the law. “The law is very clear; across the board regulations cannot make anything that is legal, illegal or vice versa. I understand that a number of people have concerns,” said Gabriel Di Chiara, the chief deputy secretary of state. “I think the fact of the matter is, though, that the possibility exists that some of these people have a misinterpretation of the law itself.” Other regulations On Thursday the Legislative Commission also approved election regulations that generally cover applying existing rules to the new presidential primary in February and technical election administration. The other regulations approved are: Update: 9/29/23 at 10:45 a.m. —This article was updated to include details on the candidates who have made appointments to file for the presidential preference primary with the secretary of state's office once filing opens next week.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-calls-on-embattled-menendez-to-resign-joining-other-senate-democrats,True,"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) called Tuesday morning for indicted Sen. Bob Menendez’s (D-NJ) resignation, joining a raft of vulnerable incumbents in distancing herself from the beleaguered New Jerseyan. In a statement, Rosen said Menendez is entitled to a fair trial, but called the indictment a “distraction that undermines the bipartisan work we need to do in the Senate for the American people.” “The well-documented political corruption charges are a violation of the public trust, and Senator Menendez should resign,” Rosen said in a statement Menendez wasindictedFriday on federal corruption charges. According to the indictment, the longtime Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman wasallegedto have accepted bribes from Egyptian government officials, including receivinggold barsand a luxury car. The indictment alleges that Menendez used his power to do favors for officials in Egypt’s authoritarian government in exchange for personal enrichment. In a Monday press conference, Menendez was defiant,rejectingcalls to resign and saying that the $480,000 in cash found in his home as part of the investigation were emergency funds he withdrew because of his heritage, saying his family faced confiscation in Cuba. He has repeatedly cited hisLatino identityas an explanation for the indictment. Rosen was the eighth Senate Democrat to call for Menendez to resign, joining Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jon Tester (D-MT) and Bob Casey (D-PA), among others. Those five are all running for re-election in 2024 in states that President Joe Biden won by small margins or lost in 2020. Rosen’s campaign also said it would donate $10,000 received in March from Menendez’s New Millenium PAC to charity. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV)toldSemafor's Joseph Zeballos-Roig Tuesday evening that the matter was ""up to the voters of New Jersey."" The two areoftenallieson issues affecting Latinos, as two of just four Latino Senate Democrats — a group in which Menendez is the most senior member. The other two — Sens. Alex Padilla (D-CA) and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) — have not publicly spoken about Menendez since the indictment was released. Earlier this year, Rosen sponsoreda billto deny federal pensions to lawmakers convicted of felonies related to their time in office. Brought into the spotlight earlier this year after theindictmentof Rep. George Santos (R-NY), the Menendez case could again provide momentum for Rosen’s bill. Menendez was previously indicted in 2015 — again on corruption charges — in a case that ended in amistrialin 2017. Although Republican Chris Christie was governor of New Jersey during his prior legal battle, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy now occupies the governor’s mansion in Trenton, meaning he could appoint another Democrat to Menendez’s seat if he resigns. Murphy, as well as a number of other New Jersey Democrats, quickly called on Menendez to step down last week. At the time of Menendez’s Monday press conference, Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) was the only senator to have called for his resignation. Rosen’s announcement — shortly followed by fellow New Jersey’s other Democratic Sen. Cory Booker — was part of a dam break Tuesday morning. This story was updated Tuesday afternoon to include comment from Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lombardo-not-getting-engaged-on-presidential-primary-trump-re-election-bid,True,"Gov. Joe Lombardoagainpublicly declined to endorse anyone for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination — including former President Donald Trump, whoendorsed Lombardoduring his gubernatorial run last year. Speaking toNevada IndependentCEO Jon Ralston during a wide-ranging discussion Saturday at the annual policy and politics-focusedTexas TribuneFestival, the Republican governor’s comments come as he has begun endorsing candidates in down-ballot races and as a PAC linked to his campaign has intensified its campaign against legislative Democrats. “I’ve said it publicly, I’m not getting engaged,” Lombardo said. “I’m worried about the state of Nevada right now, and I’m not going to get engaged in the presidential process until after the primary.” Those comments echo what Lombardotold reporters in August, when he said he would “support whoever is successful in the primary.” Though he said Trump was “innocent until proven guilty” in themidst of four criminal indictments, including two in federal court, Lombardo also said he was “concerned” about the former president’s legal troubles. “I can't turn a blind eye to it,” said Lombardo, a former Clark County sheriff. “You see the polls out there, ‘If he was indicted for a felony, would you still vote for him,’ and everything that goes along with that — that hurts my core, and what I believe in.” On the state’s 2024 U.S. Senate race, in which eight Republican candidates are jockeying to take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Lombardo said he is supportive of Sam Brown, a retired U.S. Army captain who finished second in last year’s GOP primary for Senate, but clarified that he is not yet endorsing Brown. “The reason why I haven't done it yet [is] because I don't want to get too early in the process,” he said. “I just want a little more stability in the candidates before I make that decision.” Over the course of an hour at TribFest, Lombardo also spoke about a host of other topics, including the Legislature, the A’s potential move to Las Vegas and more. We’ve highlighted parts of Lombardo’s interview below: Legislature Though a pro-Lombardo political action committee, the Better Nevada PAC,has castSenate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) as “one of the most corrupt politicians in Nevada,” Lombardo said he didn’t agree with that portrayal. “I don’t believe she’s corrupt,” Lombardo said. “I think she’s passionate about what she stands for, and I think it’s important for people to look through that, and understand that.” Lombardo added that he and Cannizzaro do not always see eye-to-eye on issues such as school choice, but “she’s a hard worker and she does her homework.” The Better Nevada PAC has also attacked legislative Democrats over their support for so-called “Christmas Tree” bills, which saw lawmakersappropriate more than $110 million to a variety of nonprofit and other organizations. Laterreporting revealedconnections between lawmakers and some organizations funded by the bill. Lombardo signed the bills, but said the process “didn’t sit well with me,” while noting that “there was also programs in there that would suffer as a result of not signing it.” He said he wishes he had aline-item veto, and that there should be more transparency at the Legislature, including removing its exemption from the public records process. “I think that's a very poor way to do government, to have a significant key, one of the three-legged stools of government to be exempt from public evaluation,” he said. Lombardo said he intends to change that exemption. K-12 accountability Lombardo acknowledged that his recently announced ""Acing Accountability"" initiative to hold public K-12 spending accountable lacked an enforcement mechanism and was ""not fully baked."" The initiative came after Lombardo authorized a more than $2.3 billion increase inK-12 spendingduring the legislative session. “The accountability matrix is to ensure that they're meeting the numbers that are on an average nationwide, so there's no excuses,” Lombardo said. “You can't bring it back to your particular geography and say, ‘Alright, we're going to dumb down the curriculum, just so we can have graduation numbers.’ That's the current attitude right now.” Still, Lombardo said executive tools that might hold schools and districts accountable are a “void in the law.” “Knowing that I can be proactive in the next legislative session, we'll put those measurement tools in place,” Lombardo said. “Because right now, the only ability to provide discipline or to change the environment is to remove the money. And we already determined the money is also an integral part, so that doesn’t solve anything.” A’s to Vegas Lombardo reiterated his support for a deal struck earlier this year toprovide up to $380 million in public financingfor the construction of a new Major League Baseball stadium for the Oakland A’s in Las Vegas, saying it has the potential for a “return on investment that's exponential.” Research generally shows that stadiums havelittle positive economic impacton local economies, though backers of the A’s movearguethat Las Vegas will be different. “I think people look at it from a lens of a short term, we're giving away money to a billionaire,” he said. “I look at it from a lens — this is long term, and how are we going to benefit from the tax base and expansion of the economy that we're trying to achieve in the long term.” Separately, at a breakfast in Las Vegas last week hosted by the Commercial Real Estate Development Association (NAIOP) of Southern Nevada, Lombardo told attendees to look past social media negativity about the A’s being a “loser team” because adding professional baseball to Las Vegas will help fill the summer events calendar, when professional hockey and football are in their offseasons. “And here's the coup de grâce: in 30 years at the end of that contract with Clark County and the state, the county owns that stadium,” he said. Ethics commission In July, the eight-member Nevada Ethics Commissionissueda $20,000 fine and censure against Lombardo for using his sheriff uniform and badge while running for governor in 2022. In August, Lombardo’s attorneys announced that the governor wouldappealin court. “It was a partisan decision. There was people involved in this that I feel made decisions based on not the right thing, but partisanship,” Lombardo said. “And that's frustrating to me, and that's why I fight it.” Legislative compromises Bucking his party, Lombardosigned a billduring the legislative session requiring insurance to provide coverage for gender-affirming care for transgender minors and adults. He said that when looking at legislation, he takes a “pragmatic approach,” seeking to understand the ramifications of signing the bill. Under the gender-affirming care bill, Lombardo said minors still had to receive parental consent, and noted that people were already receiving gender-affirming care. Lombardo also signed a billprotecting out-of-state abortion seekers, essentially codifying anexecutive orderissued by former Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat. Whileon the campaign trail, Lombardo had said he would govern through a “pro-life lens” butsaidhe would sign legislation making Sisolak’s executive order permanent. Lombardo said he’s pro-life, but he needs to be pragmatic as a governor. “[Abortion rights are] codified in state law,” Lombardo said, noting that he would support a hypothetical effort to lower the 24-week abortion protection in state law to a 15-week cutoff, but would not lead such an effort. “I think it should go back to a vote of the people for them to make a decision,” he said. When asked how he voted on theinitial 1990 referendumestablishing abortion rights in state law, Lombardo said “I don’t recall.” Pushed to give an answer, Lombardo said, “No, I’m serious. I’m not avoiding the question. I don’t recall if I voted on that particular issue.” Housing affordability Lombardo tied the issue ofaffordable housingin Nevada directly to the “availability of land,” taking issue with the fact that more than 80 percent of the acreage in the state is federally owned and managed, and arguing that the federal government is “charging way too much” for it. “That upsets me to no end because the federal government's in the nonprofit business, so whatever money they receive off the sale of a piece, parcel of land goes into the general fund and its pixie dust compared to the total federal budget,” he said. Lombardo added that he’d like to see a more regular process of releasing parcels of land, and believes the costs should be charged “on the back end versus the front end.” Teacher pay impasse As contract negotiations between the state’s largest teachers’ union and largest school district in Clark Countyhave implodedamidallegations of an illegal strikeand abrewing court battle, the unionlast monthcalled on Lombardo to help negotiate an end to the collective bargaining stalemate. Lombardo ultimately met with union and district negotiators, of which he said: “I personally thought there was an agreement, and then when they met again, they decided to go to an impasse.” That impasse will soon trigger a formal arbitration process, which Lombardo said could take six to eight months. The governor added he “recently got engaged again this last week.” “I said, ‘Hey, even though you’ve declared an impasse, you can still have the ability to mediate and hopefully come up with a solution before the official arbitration procedure starts.” Still, Lombardo said he believed there remains a greater than 50 percent chance the impasse reaches an arbitrator.",Error: Connection error.

The district includes a portion of northwest Las Vegas and is held by Assemblyman Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas), who announced plans to run for an open state Senate seat earlier this year. Hampton is in recovery from a decade-long opioid addiction and has led many addiction recovery organizing campaigns. An author and public speaker, he also served as a former aide to President Bill Clinton. According to reports from the caucus, Hampton is amassing a war chest and has already raised more than $140,000. That number cannot be verified until he files his firstcontributions and expense reportwith the Nevada secretary of state’s office on Jan. 15, 2024 (state lawrequires a candidate to report by that deadline if he or she has received one or more contributions over $100, regardless of whether the person has filed a declaration of candidacy). Earlier this year, Lombardo endorsed Republican businesswoman Lisa Cole for the seat. The district has a fairly even party split, with 31 percent of voters registered as Republicans, 30 percent registered as Democrats and 31 percent registered as nonpartisan.

The district is represented by Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas), who is running for Congress. It’s unclear how the indictment will affect Law’s run for office. He did not respond to a phone call or voice message requesting an interview or comment on the indictment. ThePrinceton Gerrymandering Projectindicates the district has a slight Democratic lean. About 30 percent of voters are registered as Democrats, 31 percent as Republicans and 31 percent as nonpartisans. Assembly Democrats endorse attorney for Reno Assembly District 27 seat Nevada Assembly Democrats endorsed attorney Alex Velto for Assembly District 27, held by Assemblywoman Angie Taylor (D-Reno), who is running for state Senate District 15. Velto is an attorney at the Hutchison & Steffen law firm, practicing primarily in litigation and labor and employment law. In the endorsement message, Democrats said Velto would focus on improving the education system, reducing health care costs and keeping communities safe. The district is considered a safe Democratic seat, where 34 percent of voters are registered as Democrats, 25 percent are registered as Republicans and 33 percent are registered as nonpartisans. Lombardo endorses GOP opponent for Assembly District 25 Gov. Joe Lombardo endorsed Diana Sande for Nevada Assembly District 25 on Dec. 5. The district is represented by Assemblywoman Selena La Rue Hatch (D-Reno), who assumed office after the 2022 election. Sande was born in Puerto Rico and is the health communications and program manager of UNR’s Black Youth Mental Health Initiative through the School of Public Health. The district has a Democratic lean, with 34 percent of voters registered as Democrats, 31 percent registered as Republicans and 28 percent registered as nonpartisan. Lombardo endorses GOP challenger in Assembly District 41 Gov. Joe Lombardo endorsed businessman Rafael Arroyo for Southern Nevada’s Assembly District 41, which has been represented by Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) since 2017. In his Dec.4 endorsement, Lombardo cited Arroyo’s record as an entrepreneur. According to Arroyo’s campaign website, he established the first Smog Plus business in the Las Vegas Valley in 2008 and has since opened up 10 more locations where customers can test their cars for emissions and receive third-party vehicle registration services. “As we work to empower small businesses across Nevada, Rafael knows the challenges they face and understands how to ensure their continued growth,” Lombardo said. In 2022, Jauregui won re-election to the seat by a margin of 5.7 points, or roughly 1,400 votes. Within the district, Democrats account for about 31 percent of registered voters, Republicans represent about 25 percent of registered voters and roughly 36 percent of voters are nonpartisan. An analysis by thePrinceton Gerrymandering Projectindicates that the district has a slight Democratic advantage. Democrats endorse candidate in Assembly District 29 race Months after Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen (D-Henderson) announced she would not run for re-election in 2024, the Nevada Assembly Democratic Caucus has endorsed attorney Joe Dalia for the seat. An attorney specializing in privacy law, Dalia said in the Nov. 30 announcement that he is committed to building a Nevada where his three children and other young people in Nevada “will grow up and have greater opportunities.” “As a father of three children, Joe knows firsthand the challenges families face all across Nevada, and we are proud to support him for AD-29,” said Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas). Gov. Joe Lombardo has endorsed Republican educator Annette Dawson Owens for the seat. Cohen defeated Dalia in the 2022 Democratic primary election by nearly 40 percentage points. Democrats represent 32 percent of registered voters in the district, while Republicans represent 25 percent of registered voters and 35 percent are nonpartisan. Democrats endorse challenger in competitive Senate District 5 The Nevada Senate Democratic caucus endorsed lobbyist Jennifer Atlas as the Democratic challenger for Senate District 5, represented by Sen. Carrie Buck (R-Henderson). In an announcement released Nov. 29, the caucus described Atlas as an education advocate and community leader “running to provide more effective leadership” in the Senate. “As a single mother, Jennifer knows the challenges Nevada families face,” said Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas). “I know Jennifer will fight to lower the cost of housing and health care, get a qualified teacher in every classroom, and will stand up to extremists looking to take away our rights.” Atlas serves on the City of Henderson’s Blue Ribbon Commission on Education. The district has a fairly even partisan split, with 29.7 percent of voters registered as Democrats, 29.7 percent registered as Republicans and 32.9 percent registered as nonpartisan.Buck narrowly won her 2020 Senate race by half a percentage point, carrying 48.8 percent of the vote. As president of The Pinecrest Foundation, which supports educational initiatives for students, Buck has made education a central tenet of her re-election campaign. Democrats endorse candidate for vacant Assembly District 10 seat The Nevada Assembly Democratic Caucus endorsed retired electrician Venise Karris to fill the Assembly District 10 seat after Assemblywoman Sabra Smith Newby (D-Las Vegas)resignedfrom it in August to take a job as a Las Vegas deputy city manager. The Nov. 28 announcement highlighted Karris’ experience as an executive board member and an acting union steward of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 357 for almost seven years. “She has a decades-long history in the district and I am confident she will connect with the residents of Assembly District 10 and bring a unique perspective to the Legislature,” said Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) in a press release. The district favors Democrats, with 37 percent of voters registered as Democrats, 20 percent as Republicans and 35 percent as nonpartisans. Lombardo endorses educator Annette Dawson Owens for Assembly District 29 Educator Annette Dawson Owens, a Republican, announced plans to run for Henderson’s Assembly District 29 on Nov. 14 with an endorsement from Gov. Joe Lombardo. The longtime educator whoworksas the Children Advocacy Alliance’s School Readiness policy director aims to flip the key legislative battleground district red. Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen (D-Henderson) announced earlier this year she would not run for re-election in 2024, citing a desire to focus on her private life. “I've devoted my career to helping children succeed, and I'm ready to work with Governor Lombardo to ensure we continue improving our schools,” Dawson Owens said in a press release. Joe Dalia, a Democrat and attorney Cohen defeated in the 2022 primary election, is alsorunningfor the seat. Democrats represent 32 percent of registered voters in the district, while Republicans represent 25 percent of registered voters and 35 percent are nonpartisan. Northern Nevada Assembly Republican announces re-election bid Assemblywoman Jill Dickman (R-Sparks) intends to run for re-election to again represent Northern Nevada’s Assembly District 31. Dickman said in her Nov. 6 announcement that the upcoming session is “critical” to protecting Nevada’s friendly business climate and working to fix the state’s education system. The Republican has served three nonconsecutive terms in the Assembly. The district favors Republicans, with 39 percent of voters registered as Republicans, 26 percent registered as Democrats and 27 percent as nonpartisan. Lombardo endorses businesswoman Lisa Cole in Assembly District 4 election Businesswoman Lisa Cole has jumped into the crowded Assembly District 4 Republican primary election with a coveted endorsement from Gov. Joe Lombardo. In her Nov. 6 announcement, Cole played up her years of business experience and noted she played a significant role in establishing North Las Vegas’ Apex Industrial Park through her work on groundwater rights permitting and water system design. ""Nevada needs leaders who will empower working families with new opportunities, not hold them back,"" Cole said in a press release. The northwest Las Vegas seat is open after incumbent Assemblyman Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas) announced plans to run for an open state Senate seat. Other GOP candidates include former Metro Police Captain Robert Plummer and businessman Jacob Deaville, who has been endorsed by Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony, State Controller Andy Matthews and McArthur. Voter registration for the district as of the end of October is about 30 percent Democrat, roughly 31 percent Republican and about 31 percent nonpartisan. Assembly Democrats announce 19 re-election bids Nineteen incumbent Assembly Democrats are planning to run for re-election in 2024. The Nov. 2 announcement indicates that a majority of the 28 Assembly Democrats who served in 2023 will seek another two-year term in the chamber. Those planning to run again include Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas), Majority Floor Leader Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas), Speaker Pro Tem Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-Las Vegas) and seven lawmakers who chaired committees in the 2023 session. Only three lawmakers who chaired a committee will not be running for a chance to return. The full list of Democrats running for re-election: Though the majority of Assembly Democrats are planning to return, a quarter of the state’s 42 Assembly members will not be running for re-election, with some announcing early resignations and others running for a different office. The only incumbent Democrat in the Assembly who has not announced her plans is Assemblywoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong (D-Las Vegas). Democrat Bea Duran announces she will not run for re-election Assemblywoman Bea Duran (D-Las Vegas) announced Oct. 30 she would not be running for re-election to her Las Vegas-area Assembly district, saying that she wanted to “step away to spend more time with my family and make room for new voices to lead our state.” First appointed to represent Assembly District 11 in 2018, Duran — a Culinary Union grievance specialist — won subsequent re-elections in 2020 and 2022. No major party candidate has yet announced a bid to represent the district in which Democrats hold a 30 percentage point advantage in registered voters over Republicans. Retired Henderson police officer Arndt gets Lombardo endorsement for Assembly bid Republican retired police officer April Arndt announced her candidacy for Las Vegas' Assembly District 21 — and an endorsement from Gov. Joe Lombardo — on Oct. 24. The district is represented by Assemblywoman Elaine Marzola (D-Las Vegas), who won her 2022 race by 4.8 percentage points. “A mother of three and a 22-year veteran of the Henderson Police Department who served in the Special Victims Unit, April knows firsthand how important it is that we empower law enforcement to protect our communities,” Lombardo said in a press release. “April will provide a vital perspective for how to put criminals in jail and ensure justice for victims.” Arndt ran for Senate District 12 in 2022, but lost in the Republican primary. The seat is now held by Democrat Julie Pazina. Assembly District 21 has a narrow Democratic advantage, with the party holding a 5 percentage point lead in registered voters over Republicans. Former Assemblyman John Ellison announces bid for Senate Former Assemblyman John Ellison (R-Elko) announced a bid Oct. 23 for Senate District 19, which covers a significant portion of eastern Nevada and includes portions of Elko, Eureka, White Pine, Nye, Lincoln and Clark counties. The seat, which is held by termed-out Sen. Pete Goicoechea (R-Eureka), is a longtime Republican stronghold, with the Republican Party carrying a 13 percentage point lead in registered voters over Democrats. “I am proud of the work I was able to accomplish during my time in the Assembly,” Ellison said in a press release. “Running for the Senate is something I've always wanted to do, and now that my friend Pete Goicoechea is leaving, I am ready to step in.” A founding member of the Nevada Legislative Freedom Caucus in 2021, Ellison served as an assemblyman from 2010 to 2022. He was endorsed by State Controller Andy Matthews, Republican Assembly Minority Leader P.K. O’Neill (R-Carson City) and Republican Assembly Northern Nevada Leader Jill Dickman (R-Reno). Lori Rogich to challenge Harris, gets Lombardo endorsement Republican Lori Rogich, an attorney and the spouse of former Iceland ambassador Sig Rogich, announced Oct. 18 that she would run for Senate District 11 against incumbent Sen. Dallas Harris (D-Las Vegas). Her campaign announcement included an endorsement from Gov. Joe Lombardo. “A single mother that put herself through college and law school, built a successful business, and now a tireless education advocate, Lori has a unique perspective that will be invaluable in the legislature,” Lombardo said. Rogich spent her career advising businesses on government regulations and compliance andrecently won a lawsuitagainst the Clark County School District for failing to adequately meet the needs of children who learn differently. The Las Vegas district is considered competitive, with more registered nonpartisans than either major party. Democrats only carry a 6 percentage point voter registration advantage over Republicans. Harris announced that she would be running for re-election on Oct. 10. Deaville announces for McArthur’s seat Businessman Jacob Deaville launched a bid Tuesday for Assembly District 4, which includes portions of northwest Las Vegas and is open after incumbent Assemblyman Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas) announced he's running for state Senate. ""With Democrats already holding a supermajority in the Assembly, we can’t afford to lose a single seat in 2024,” Deaville said in his press announcement. A Republican, Deaville announced endorsements from Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony, State Controller Andy Matthews and McArthur. “When elected to office, I will fight to improve our economy, pull Nevada out of the bottom of the barrel in education, help our law enforcement fight crime and lock up criminals, and defend our children from attacks on their innocence from politicians and bureaucrats,” Deaville said. In the announcement, Deaville highlighted his experience as the president of the UNLV College Republicans and said he “successfully exposed liberal bias and extremist professors on campus.” In 2022, Deaville ran for adjacent Assembly District 37 but lost to Assemblywoman Shea Backus (D-Las Vegas) by 2.6 percentage points. Lombardo endorses fire chief for Senate District 18 seat In the already crowded Republican primary to represent Senate District 18, which covers the far northwest corner of the Las Vegas Valley, Gov. Joe Lombardo endorsed Clark County Fire Chief John Steinbeck on Friday. The coveted endorsement highlighted Steinbeck's experience as ""a first responder, firefighter, leader, manager and family man."" ""He's an outstanding leader, and he will serve with honor and integrity in Carson City,"" Lombardo wrote in apost on X, formerly known as Twitter. Assemblyman Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas) and businessman Josh Leavitt also announced bids for the state Senate seat, which is represented by termed-out state Sen. Scott Hammond (R-Las Vegas). Hafen announces re-election bid Third-term Assemblyman Gregory Hafen II (R-Pahrump) announced in mid-September that he would be running for re-election in 2024 to represent Assembly District 36. “Republicans throughout the state must ensure they vote Republican all the way down the ticket in the 2024 election in order to prevent Democrat super majorities in both houses,” Hafen said in his campaign announcement. “We must defend Governor Lombardo’s ability to veto the bad policies of the Democrat Party that harm hard working Nevadans.” Cannizzaro goes for third term Sen. Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) — the Senate’s majority leader since 2019 and the first woman to hold the title in Nevada — is throwing her hat into the ring for a third (and final, because of term limits) state Senate run in 2024. Long a swing district, her Summerlin-area Senate District 6 will be easier to defend this go-round, as redistricting gave Democrats an 11-point edge over Republicans among registered voters, per thePrinceton Gerrymandering Project. Oldest lawmaker looks to jump from Assembly to open Senate seat In September, the state’s oldest lawmaker, 80-year-old Assemblyman Richard McArthur (R-Las Vegas),announceda bid for state Senate District 18 which covers the far northwest corner of the Las Vegas Valley. The district represented by termed-out Sen. Scott Hammond (R-Las Vegas) isthe only urban Las Vegas districtwhere the expected vote share favors Republicans over Democrats (51.7 percent to 48.3 percent), according to the Princeton UniversityGerrymandering Project). McArthur has served five nonconsecutive terms in the Assembly between 2008 and 2023. Five Assembly incumbents bow out As of Sept. 21, at least five members of the state Assembly have announced that they will not be running for re-election in 2024. Assemblywoman Sabra Newby (D-Las Vegas) hasresignedfrom the Legislature to take a job as deputy city manager in Las Vegas. “This is my return to local government,” Newbytold theNevada Current. “It’s a passion of mine in terms of service to our citizens. It was the honor of my career to serve as an assemblywoman in the Nevada State Assembly, but I feel like this is my home. I have so much to give in that capacity.” Assemblywoman Michelle Gorelow (D-Las Vegas)announcedthat she would not run for re-election Sept. 1, a surprise move that came after Gorelow faced increasing pressure to justifytaking a new positionat anonprofit that received hundreds of thousands of dollarsin legislatively approved funding earlier this year. Gorelow toldThe Nevada Independentthat the pushback did not affect her decision not to run in 2024 because she wanted to focus on her new role implementing an early intervention program for children with disabilities, which would be time-consuming. In key legislative battleground Assembly District 29, Assemblywoman Lesley Cohen (D-Henderson)announcedshe would not be running for re-election in 2024, citing a desire to focus on her private life. “I am deeply grateful for the trust and support my constituents and supporters have placed in me since 2012, however, I have decided it is time to take a step back from politics and focus on my private life moving forward,” Cohen said in a statement. Joe Dalia, a Democrat and attorney who Cohen defeated in the primary election last year, isrunningfor the seat again. In August, Assemblywoman Claire Thomas (D-North Las Vegas) declared her candidacy for Senate District 1, a seat represented by Sen. Pat Spearman (D-North Las Vegas), who is termed out. Second-term Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas)announced plansin August to run for Southern Nevada’s Congressional District 3 instead of Summerlin’s Assembly District 2, pledging to focus her campaign on education, economic development and public safety. Democratic Assembly members seeking Senate seats face primary challengers In two open state Senate districts, competitive Democratic primaries are already beginning to unfold. Higher education regent and school principal Michelee “Shelly” Cruz-Crawford announced she was running for the overwhelmingly Democratic Senate District 1, represented by termed-out Sen. Pat Spearman (D-North Las Vegas). Though Cruz-Crawford has theearly backingof the Senate Democratic Caucus, she will likely be running against Assemblywoman Claire Thomas (D-North Las Vegas), whoannouncedduring the AFL-CIO convention in August that she would be running for the seat. Within hours of one another, AssemblywomanAngie Taylor (D-Reno)and longtime Reno City Council member Naomi Duerrannouncedplans in early September to run for Senate District 15 in 2024, setting up a Democratic primary challenge in a key legislative seat closely eyed by both political parties. The two Democrats are competing for the seat of Sen. Heidi Seevers Gansert (R-Reno), who has spent more than a dozen years in the Legislature butannouncedin early August that she would not run for re-election in order to spend more time with her family. No Republican candidates have announced for the Senate seat yet. Her decision not to run for a third term comes after the2021 redistricting process, in which legislators redrew Seevers Gansert’s district tofavor Democratic candidates. The Democratic voter registration advantage over Republicans increased from about 1 point to more than 6 points. Republicans look to flip swingy Assembly seats Two of the first Republicans to announce they are seeking to flip control of seats in the Assembly are businessman Brandon Davis and attorney David Brog. Davisannouncedin August that he would run for Assembly District 34, which is represented by Assemblywoman Shannon Bilbray-Axelrod (D-Las Vegas) and one of the seats Republicans are targeting this election cycle. Davis made an unsuccessful bid for governor in 2022 as a Libertarian candidate. Brog is looking to unseat Assemblywoman Shea Backus (D-Las Vegas), who represents Assembly District 37. Backus won her seat by about 2.6 percentage points in 2022 in a district that has a fairly even distribution of Democrats, Republicans and nonpartisan voters. Last year, Brog finished second in the Republican primary for Congressional District 1.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-gop-approves-party-run-caucus-that-will-exclude-candidates-who-run-in-primary,True,"Members of the Nevada GOP voted Saturday to establish rules for a party-run caucus that include barring candidates who choose to have their name listed on the ballot for a state-run primary election being held two days earlier and restricting political action committees from getting involved. The approval came during the Nevada GOP’s fall meeting in Winnemucca as part of the state party’s decision to abandon the primary established by a 2021 law and hold a party-run caucus in 2024. The party prohibited members of the media from attending the meeting. In a phone call withThe Nevada IndependentSaturday evening, Nevada GOP Chairman Michael McDonald said that the vote “overwhelmingly” was to have a caucus. “We've all voted for the caucus, so we're all gonna work together,” McDonald said. “I was born and raised here. [Having a caucus] is one of the purest forms I've seen where candidates actually have opted to come out and talk with people.” Rules adopted by the party stipulate that the caucus — set to be held just two days after the primary, on Feb. 8 — will bar candidates who file for the primary, require a $55,000 fee for each campaign to register for the caucus and prohibit “super PACs” from participating in the caucus. McDonald said that as long as campaigns hold an event with the state party, it will refund $20,000 of that fee. The split over the caucus and primary setup has frustrated Republican campaigns hoping to oust Trump from his de facto position as party leader and led to condemnation from other Republican groups that fear negative effects on the state’s election process. Earlier this month, the Ron DeSantis-linked super PAC Never Back Down called the planned caucus “rigged” to benefit Trump just as the PAC announced it wouldpull back on organizing efforts in Nevada. The Nevada Republican Club, which has about 400 members, also sent a letter to each of Nevada’s Republican Party county chairmen opposing the caucus. In the letter, signees wrote that holding the primary election and the caucus two days apart would “frustrate, anger and confuse Nevada’s Republican voters.” “Even if the winner of the February 6th Primary received more votes than the winner of the February 8th caucus, it won’t matter,” the letter said. “They won’t get delegates [to go to the Republican National Convention]. The voters will not react well to that, nor will the campaigns.” In response to fears about the caucus benefiting Trump, McDonald said, “it’s not true.” “The caucus is probably the purest form of anybody who wants to get delegates — you have to put in the time in the state,” McDonald said. “I can push back and say, ‘Look, put your team together and come out to Nevada and start knocking some doors.'” So far, only one candidate — Vivek Ramaswamy — has filed for the caucus. Ramaswamy’s participation ensures at least one candidate other than Trump will participate in the caucus. In a statement following the announcement on Tuesday, McDonald said the state GOP was “thrilled.” “His early commitment signifies not only his passion for representing the voices of Nevadans but also solidifies that Nevada is a key early state for the Republican Presidential nomination process,"" McDonald said. McDonald added that presidential candidate Larry Elder and former President Donald Trump have indicated they will be filing to participate in the caucus. An early nominating state As early nominating states, including Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, have been buzzing with Republican presidential hopefuls, Nevada has been a far less popular destination. Candidate visits among the13-person fieldhave been sparse — DeSantis headlinedthe Basque Fryin June, while Trump emerged fora rally in Las Vegas in July. Political television spots have been dominated by President Joe Biden, as Republicans have ceded spending on the airwaves for all but incidental ads on national programming. As of early September, thead tracking firm Ad Impactfound that out of more than $100 million GOP presidential ad spending from candidates and outside groups, only about $1 million had been spent in Nevada. Though DeSantis was the first declared presidential candidate to visit Nevada this cycle and Trump has lost two general elections in Nevada, the former president has long dominated among Nevada’s Republican voters. Trump nearly swept the2016 caucus, winning 15 of 17 counties (including Clark and Washoe) and nearly 46 percent of the vote at a time when the field still held 11 candidates. In the 2020 general election — which Trump lost to Biden in Nevada by 2.4 percentage points — Trump still secured a higher share of the vote (47.7 percent compared to 45.5 percent in 2016) as well as 157,800 more raw votes than he did in 2016. When Trump and his campaign later claimed, baselessly, that the election had been stolen in key battleground states, including Nevada, Nevada’s state Republican Party backed the president’s claims. That included McDonald, who was among a group of Nevada Republicans who attempted to file a false slate of presidential electors supporting Trump instead of Biden. McDonald has since been among a pair of Nevada Republicans who faced subpoenas from the House January 6 committee. In June, he also testified before a grand jury in Washington, D.C. as part of a federal probe from special counsel Jack Smith into efforts to subvert the 2020 election results. McDonald said that the best thing about the meeting on Saturday is the “unity of support” that came once everyone was together. “Once the vote was over, everybody started coming together. We’re going to work together,” McDonald said. “People that were critical and sent out letters and stuff, they want to come back and let's get a Republican elected.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lombardo-campaign-pivots-legal-defense-fund-to-ethics-case,True,"A year after creating a legal defense fund to pay legal fees related to a challenge to his primary victory by another candidate, Gov. Joe Lombardo’s campaign is using the fund to ward off a case from the Nevada Ethics Commission, which earlier this year levied a censure and $20,000 fine for Lombardo for using his sheriff’s badge and uniform in his campaign for governor. The change comes as Lombardo’s campaign filed new campaign finance documents Sept. 1, outlining exactly how much money the legal defense fund raised — $85,000 — and who funded it. That fundraising information was bundled in Lombardo’sother campaign finance reportslast year, and only recently separated after being flagged by the secretary of state’s office earlier this year. Legal defense funds operate under aNevada lawthat allows political campaigns to raise donations explicitly for the use of mounting a legal defense “arising from a campaign, the electoral process or the performance of official duties.” These defense funds are subject to the same contribution limits ($10,000) as candidates for state office. In Lombardo’s case, the legal defense fund wasestablished in late July last yearto pay for the defense of a legal challenge to Lombardo’s primary victory filed by fellow Republican gubernatorial hopeful Joey Gilbert. After finishing second to Lombardo by roughly 26,000 votes, Gilbert alleged ina court filingthat  “algorithms” used by electronic voting machines had switched votes, creating inflated vote tallies for Lombardo and denying Gilbert victory. Gilbert’s suit also proposed an equally sweeping remedy — applying a “mathematical” correction to the vote tallies and awarding the primary win to Gilbert, instead. A state district court judge tossed the case, and later ordered Gilbert topay $161,000 of Lombardo’s attorneys feesas part of the state’s “frivolous lawsuit” statute. That penalty wasupheld last monthby the state Supreme Court, after Gilbert’s lawyer challenged the payment. At the time — and according to the documents filed earlier this month — the legal fund raised $85,000, of which more than $82,500 was paid out to the law firm of Campbell & Williams, which represented Lombardo in the case. Editor’s note: Campbell & Williams has provided The Nevada Independent with pro bono legal services and advice. More recent fundraising totals are not available, as the last reporting period included was the final three months of 2022. Legal defense funds are tied to the same reporting requirements as other state campaign finance reports, which won’t be required again until after the first quarter of 2024. All of that money came from just nine donors, of which eight gave the maximum $10,000 — including the state Republican Party, as well as two PACs linked to the campaign: Better Nevada and Stronger Nevada. The rest came from individual donors. That includes David Chesnoff (a Las Vegas-based criminal defense attorney and one-time law partner to Oscar Goodman), Nickolas Mamula (the owner of a Las Vegas-area tiling business), Marnell Gaming and R&S Leasing (a company linked to Snap Towing CEO Robert Ellis and that frequently gives to Democrats and Republicans). Finally, a $5,000 contribution came from LAJG Inc., a company whoseonly officeris Donna Lombardo, the state’s first lady. A source close to Lombardo’s campaign confirmed that the defense fund has now pivoted to funding the governor’s legal fight with the Nevada Ethics Commission. The commission’srulingfound that the governor improperly used the “accoutrements of office” in campaign materials, including using his uniform and badge, and fined the now-governor $20,000 and issued a censure. That fine came well belowan initial recommendation of $1.6 million, which sought to fine each individual violation of the ethics law in question. In August, attorneys for Lombardo (who also represented the governor during the Gilbert suit) vowed tofight the censure in court.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/coalition-seeks-2024-ballot-measure-to-put-abortion-protections-in-nevada-constitution,True,"Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, apolitical action committeeformed earlier this month, announced Thursday that it has filed apetitionto place a question on the 2024 ballot to protect reproductive rights, including access to abortion services, in the state constitution. The push by the group — which includes Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada and the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada as founding members — seeks to strengthen protections for reproductive care in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturnRoe v. Wadeand federal protections for abortion access. Though abortion in Nevada is legal through 24 weeks of pregnancy and after 24 weeks if the health of the patient is in danger — and that law can only be overturned by a majority vote of the people — putting those protections in the state constitution would make them more difficult to overturn by requiring that they be voted down twice. In 1990, 63 percent of Nevada votersaffirmedthe existing protections in state law. If the proposed constitutional amendment sought by Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom qualifies for the ballot next year, it would need to pass in two consecutive general elections to be added to the state constitution. Abortion has also proven to be amotivating issuefor Democratic voters, contributing to stronger-than-expected performances for some Democratic candidates in last year’s elections, according to an analysis of voter data conducted by independent research group KFF. In Nevada, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) prevailed in her re-election bid over Republican Adam Laxalt, with a campaign that focused heavily on abortion rights. Meanwhile, efforts to pass anti-abortion measuresfailed in several red stateslast year, including Kansas and Kentucky. If Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom qualifies its petition for the ballot, it could help drive Democratic turnout in the next two general elections, if similar patterns from last year’s elections continue. Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom’s filing of a petition for the 2024 ballot also accelerates an in-state push to strengthen legal protections for abortion and other reproductive care. During the legislative session earlier this year, lawmakersapprovedSJR7, a proposed constitutional amendment that would similarly guarantee “a fundamental right to reproductive freedom.” If approved by lawmakers again in the 2025 session, the measure sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) would appear on the 2026 general election ballot — a likely scenario, given that Democrats are expected to retain control of both chambers of the Legislature. In a statement toThe Nevada Independent, Cannizzaro said she was fully in support of the coalition’s efforts to put their measure on the ballot in 2024. “This is an important ballot measure that gives Nevadans the right to control their bodies — not out of touch politicians,” Cannizzaro said. The reproductive rights group’s petition shares the same language as SJR7, seeking to declare in the state constitution that “every individual has a fundamental right to reproductive freedom, which entails the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy, including, without limitation, prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomy, tubal ligation, abortion, abortion care, management of a miscarriage and infertility care.” “The fallout of the Supreme Court’s overturning ofRoe v. Wadehas shown us that we have already suffered one year too long without the guaranteed right to reproductive freedom, and we simply cannot afford to stand by and allow any further encroachment on the fundamental right of Nevadans to determine their own reproductive lives and care,” Lindsey Harmon, executive director for Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, said in a statement. In an interview Thursday afternoon, Harmon described the proposed constitutional amendment as “more expansive than statutory protections” currently in place, and noted the similar efforts to pass abortion protections elsewhere in the country. “I think that we are really excited and honored to play such an important role in the national landscape in advancing the conversation forward, particularly in a state that is a battleground state,” Harmon said. She also described the coalition’s decision to file the petition while SJR7 still moves through the legislative process as “covering all of our bases and really making sure that we do everything we can to protect access in the state.” And Harmon emphasized that she believes voters are motivated by having the proposal on the ballot sooner. “I think voters want to talk about this. We have heard from our constituents and our member base that they want this to go to the ballot as soon as possible. They want to take a vote on it. So that's primarily our motivating factor,” Harmon said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/top-nevada-republicans-reverse-course-urge-party-to-vote-early-or-by-mail-in-2024,True,"National and Nevada GOP leaders are launching a campaign for Republicans to vote early and by mail in the 2024 election, reversing course on a voting method former President Donald Trumplambastedas corrupt in 2020. In a Wednesday call with reporters, Republican National Committee (RNC) Chair Ronna McDaniel, Gov. Joe Lombardo, Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) and state party Chair Michael McDonald urged Republican voters to either vote early or vote by mail. McDaniel described the campaign as a tactical one — using a football metaphor, she said it will ensure the party doesn’t wait until the fourth quarter to start scoring. And she added that in ensuring that high-propensity voters get their ballots in early, the RNC can expend resources on going after independents rather than ensuring their party members have voted. Amid Trump’s attacks on vote by mail in the 2020 election, the state party and the Trump campaignfiled an ultimately unsuccessful lawsuitto stop the counting of mail ballots in Clark County. Democratswonmail ballots in that election by a factor of about 2-to-1. This time around, Lombardo said Republicans need to compete on the same turf. He said Republican enthusiasm is building in the state, but he and other leaders have to convince their voters to change their mindsets about waiting to vote until Election Day or suffer the electoral consequences. “We're out of excuses,” said Lombardo, who narrowly won his statewide race in 2022 even as a Democrat, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, won in the other marquee, statewide race. “The key is to ensure that everybody has the perception that every vote has been counted … and ensure that we fight fire with fire.” The campaign — which the RNC is running nationally under the banner of “Bank Your Vote” — will involve a state-specificvoter resource pagefor Nevada asking voters to pledge to either vote early or by mail. Voters who make the pledge will get text updates from the RNC ensuring they are educated on how to vote using those methods. In2022, 39 percent of registered Republicans voted by mail, nearly 26 percent voted on Election Day and 35 percent voted early in person. Meanwhile, 61 percent of Democrats voted by mail, about 14 percent voted on Election Day and about 24 percent voted early in person. Officials on the call said achieving their banked vote goals will require changing the current Republican voting culture. Amodei, a habitual early voter himself, said poor fall weather in both the North and South can depress voter turnout — 2022’s Election Day saw Northern Nevadadeal with several inches of snow. “As a guy who has early voted since it was legal, I can tell you that it hasn't resulted in any health problem, or anything else,” Amodei said. “I'm a believer in it.” Bank Your Vote’s success will hinge on Republican leaders convincing Nevada Republican voters to use a voting method that they have constantly attacked since the state began sending mail ballots to all active registered voters in 2020. Part of the campaign is getting all Republicans “singing from the same songbook,” McDaniel said, including those who attacked vote-by-mail in prior cycles.Trumpandother prominent Republicanshave made videos supporting the Bank Your Vote campaign. But state Republicans have continued to maintain that the state’s electoral system is faulty. That’s reflected in the state GOP’s decision to hold apresidential caucusin February, in which mail ballots are not allowed and voting is done in one day, instead of the state-run primary. McDonald said early vote efforts will only work if the election system is run with integrity. He said the state party plans to continue filing election-related litigation against issues that come up at the polls as they happen and will continue to deploy poll watchers and poll workers. “On Bank to Vote, let me be very clear,” McDonald said. “It only works if we protect your vote.” The secretary of state’s office has foundno evidenceof mass electoral fraud in Nevada. When asked if the caucus’ rules, which require in-person, day-of voting, were in conflict with the Bank Your Vote theme, McDonald said the caucus was necessary to ensure the election was secure and in compliance with Lombardo’sproposed elections bill, which would have rolled back vote-by-mail and instituted voter identification requirements. The bill was not taken up by the Democrat-controlled Legislature. Lombardo declined to comment on whether he had a preference for a caucus or a primary. McDaniel said while she did not agree with Nevada’s election laws, the only way Republicans can change them is by winning elections, which includes using all the voting methods available to them. “This is crazy that Democrats are consistently trying to degrade the safety and the security of our elections,” McDaniel said. “We will continue to fight that. But when it comes to the rules that are on the playing field, we have to use them the way the Democrats do, even if we don't like them.” This story was updated at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday to include the proper spelling of the Nevada Bank Your Vote site.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-senate-candidate-sam-brown-once-supported-20-week-abortion-ban-is-now-less-specific,True,"Republican U.S. Senate candidate and retired U.S. Army Capt. Sam Browndescribes himselfas “pro life” and hassaidhe wants to see fewer abortions, but he has so far largely avoided giving specific answers to questions about his position on abortion on the Nevada campaign trail. But nearly a decade ago, Brown said he supported another state’s 20-week ban on abortion. “On issues of life, that is a nonnegotiable for me, we've got to do everything we can to empower our state, make sure that it stays on the books,” Brown saidduring a legislative candidate forum in 2014when asked how much Texas should spend, if necessary, to defend the state’s2013 abortion law, which banned abortion after 20 weeks post-fertilization. Asked for comment about his past support for the 20-week abortion ban, Brown avoided the question and reiterated his current position on abortion. “My personal view was shaped in large part by my experience in Afghanistan where I nearly lost my own life but was then blessed with a second chance at living. I’m pro life, with exceptions for the tragic cases of rape, incest and situations where the mother’s life is at risk,” Brown said in a statement. Brown is the leading Republican candidate to take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) next year, with national GOP groups and establishment D.C. Republicans supporting his candidacy — though he faces a potentiallythorny GOP primaryagainst former Assemblyman Jim Marchant and former Ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter in a growing field of challengers. On the campaign trail this year, Brown has eluded questions about his position on placing more stringent restrictions on abortion. In an interview withThe Nevada Independentin July, Browndeclined to saywhether he would support a national abortion ban, calling it a hypothetical situation and that he does not “see Nevada's laws changing.” While Brown has focused his campaign on the economy, attacking Rosen for high inflation and what he describes as excessive government spending, Democrats have continued to place abortion at the forefront,attacking Brownfor his position on the issue. During the 2014 forum, Brown said he “would have supported the legislation that passed this last special session,” referring to the2013 lawthat banned abortions in Texas past 20 weeks of pregnancy. The Texaslaw at the timeincluded exceptions after 20 weeks for cases posing a risk to the life of the patient or if the fetus has a severe medical problem, but not for cases of rape or incest. The state hassince adopteda law banning abortions if a ""fetal heartbeat"" is detected, or roughly after six weeks into pregnancy. Brown, a veteran who was severely injured by an improvised explosive device while serving in Afghanistan and suffered burns over 30 percent of his body, made his political debut in 2014 running for a seat in the Texas House of Representatives. Brown finished third in the race’s Republican primary. At the time of Brown’s 2014 run, he expressed support for more stringent, though unspecified, restrictions on abortion. “I think that it's a shame that here in Texas, which is being lauded as such a conservative state with regard to the issue of life, half of Europe has stricter laws than we do here,” hesaidduring the forum, which was hosted by a group calledFar North Dallas Tea Party Patriots. “I think we can't just let the issue lie where we're at. We need people to continue to go back to Austin who understand the sanctity of life.” Opponents of the 2013 lawarguedit would lead to many of the state's abortion clinics shutting down because they would be required to meet the same standards that hospital-style surgical centers do, and because the law mandated that a doctor who performs abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The U.S. Supreme Courtoverturnedthose parts of the law in 2016. Abortion in Nevada Nevada’sabortion lawprotects access to abortions through 24 weeks of pregnancy and after 24 weeks in order to protect the health of the mother. Nevada voters affirmed those protections via a1990 referendum, with 63 percent of voters approving of the law, meaning it can only be overturned by a majority of voters — despite the U.S. Supreme Court overturningRoe v. Wadelast year and, with it, federal protections for abortion. A May poll fromThe Nevada Independentand Noble Predictive Insightsfoundthat 62 percent of Nevada’s likely voters supported enshrining abortion protections in the Nevada Constitution. Last election cycle, abortion also proved to be a motivating issue in Nevada, particularly for Democratic voters. AJuly 2022 pollof Nevada registered voters found that abortion ranked second behind the economy as the issue most motivating respondents to vote, and aKFF/APvoter survey last fallfound that for more than four-in-ten Nevada voters, the Supreme Court overturningRoe v. Wadehad a major impact on who they voted for. Abortion access also proved to be a winning issue for Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-NV) 2022 re-election campaign, with the incumbentrunning hard on the issueamid her narrow victory over Republican Adam Laxalt. While Brown has avoided saying whether he would support specific limits on abortion nationally or within Nevada, hiscampaign websitestates that he “will oppose any bill that pushes for federal funding of abortion, late term abortions or abortion without parental notification.” Nevada lawdoes not requireparental notification or consent for those under 18 seeking an abortion, though theJuly 2022 pollfound that a majority of respondents supported a 48-hour parental notification window for minors seeking abortion care. In the July interview withThe Nevada Independent, he said he supported ensuring easier paths for adoptions and “better access and better care for both prenatal and postnatal moms,” while emphasizing he wants “to see fewer abortions.” Brown has meanwhile lambasted Rosen as “extreme on this issue,” criticizing her for what he described as support for late-term abortion at the point of seven to nine months of pregnancy. That is a reference to hersupport for the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill meant to enshrine protections fromRoe v. Wadeinto federal law. The measurewouldprevent states from prohibiting abortion services before fetal viability (about 24 weeks) or after fetal viability when a provider determines the pregnancy risks the patient's life or health. Experts saythat abortions in the third trimester are extremely rare and typically occur because of a significant fetal abnormality, according to anAssociated Pressfact checkon claims about the bill. Faith shapes Brown’s views on abortion In his failed run for U.S. Senate last year and a repeat run that began this past July, Brown has highlighted how his Christian faith has shaped his view on the subject. “The first thing I'm gonna tell you is because of my personal life experience and my faith, I am pro life,” he said in July. In the wake of his primary election loss last year, Brown became the chairman of theNevada Faith and Freedom Coalition, a nonprofit group “dedicated to educating and mobilizing people of faith, advancing individual liberty, helping those in need, protecting life and building strong bonds within our communities,” according to its website. While the national Faith and Freedom Coalition hassupportedabortion laws stricter than Nevada’s, the Nevada branch has comparatively expressed few issue positions. But Brown frames his views on the subject as not only shaped by his faith, but also by his experience of suffering severe burns during his military service. “Every life is precious, I learned that firsthand when I nearly lost my own life in Afghanistan. It’s shaped the way I view the world and mankind. It’s in our interest as a country and as human beings that we protect and value life — from the unborn to the everyday person,” he states on hiscampaign website.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/weve-got-to-do-those-things-again-inside-the-biden-campaigns-plans-for-nevada,True,"Alana Mounce may have gone national, but she first cut her teeth in Nevada Democratic politics. Mounce was the former executive director of the state party and was the Nevada state director for the Biden campaign in 2020. After working in the White House after the election, President Joe Biden’s re-election campaignnamedMounce as its 2024 ballot access director, tasking her with ensuring the president is on the ballot in all 57 states and territories. The role is both a technical one — getting signatures on petitions and filing with secretary of states’ offices — and an organizing one, reactivating the support networks and groups that powered Biden to victory in 2020. In Nevada, no petition or signatures are required — a presidential candidate wishing to appear on the ballot for the Democratic presidential primary needs to file with the secretary of state’s office by Oct. 16. Julie Chavez-Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager, said in a statement that Mounce and Varoon Modak, who will serve as general counsel for the ballot access team, will be “responsible for finding new and innovative ways to engage and organize Biden-Harris supporters where they are, which is especially important in our battleground states.” Biden won Nevada in 2020 by about 2.4 points, making it one of those critical battleground states that will determine the outcome of 2024. In an interview withThe Nevada Independent, Mounce previewed the campaign’s state strategy, discussing the issues Biden will tout and how the campaign plans to partner with groups on the ground to drive engagement early in the cycle. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Explanations of certain terms or ideas have been added in italics as needed. What does your job entail as ballot access director? As the ballot director, I’m overseeing the effort to get the president on the ballot in 57 states and territories. I’m also in charge of managing, moving, [and] tracking our delegate selection process all the way to the national convention … Really what that means is to leverage the volunteer network that we have built over the years, [those] long-standing relationships we have had across the country and in states and communities [and] nurture those relationships to do work on behalf of the campaign. What does that look like day-to-day? Every day’s different. Right now, we’re really focused on building out our team. We’re reaching out to people who were critical to our efforts in 2019 and 2020, getting them re-activated, [providing] training materials, talking to community members, signing petitions. Beyond just getting the president on the ballot, how can you use the ballot access process to engage supporters? It starts the conversation about the importance of the election and … building the foundation of our campaign. One, it shows we’re in your community, and you have an opportunity to get involved. Two, we’re [collecting] data for the campaign. We’re growing, we’re getting stronger, we’re bringing more people onto the team. All of that capacity is going to be helpful in turning out voters in the next year. Is there anything you learned during your time in Nevada that you can apply to this job? Nevada really taught me the importance of taking nothing for granted. You have to marshal the resources to do the work early. All that grit and determination [I learned in Nevada] has been really helpful in my personal and professional life. It seems like, as always, Nevada will be a swing state. What will the campaign be doing to ensure Nevada stays in the win column for the president? We’re already doing work in Nevada. We’re up on TV in the state, talking about issues that are important to Nevadans, [and] talking about the [president’s] record on prescription drugs, reducing costs for seniors, bringing clean energy jobs in the state. We’ll continue to do that in our communications with voters. That network of support that we have nationally is rooted in Nevada and [in] issues we care about. We will lean on those organizations, those partners, that network. Especially looking at Nevada — Nevada’s not a state where we’re going to be collecting petition signatures, but there [are] incredible leaders. One of the biggest differences in running a campaign in 2020 and 2024 will be the role of the pandemic. With the pandemic having mostly receded, how will that impact the way you campaign in 2024? I’m really proud of the work we did in 2020, despite the pandemic, and organizing not in the ways we usually do. We were still successful and found creative ways to bring our supporters to us. We still did — in a way that was safe — large early voteevents, partnered alongside [then-Assemblyman] Edgar Flores (D-Las Vegas). [We] had people out in the streets, visibly showing support. That still gave the same energy and enthusiasm and opportunity for people to say I’m really excited [about Biden]. Looking ahead into 2024, we’ve got to do those things again. Nevada’s a place where you need to be in person — where [voters] grocery shop, where they go to church, where they congregate — to talk about important issues and our record, and make sure they have all the information they need. There are many ways you can do that — in person, on TV, in their mailboxes. We did that effectively in 2020. And we’ll use all that’s available to us in 2024.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/election-regulations-draw-gop-pushback-again-limited-hand-counting-regulation-returns,True,"As the secretary of state’s office updates and adopts new regulations governing the state’s upcoming presidential primary elections, Nevada Republicans areonce againusing the regulatory process as a venue for airing concerns with the state’s election laws. Regulations adopted during hearings spanning Monday-Wednesday cover technical details of election administration, allowing for the implementation of state election laws approved in the last legislative session and establishing timelines for certain pre- and post-election procedures. Any regulations adopted by the secretary of state’s office must also be approved by the Legislative Commission later this month before taking effect. Deputy Secretary of State for Elections Mark Wlaschin, who led the hearings and a trio of regulation workshops last month, said during the Monday meeting that the regulations help provide “additional clarity, not only for election officials across the state, but also for members of the public about how elections are conducted.” He also responded to claims that Nevada’s elections system was unsafe or plagued by fraud in recent elections, saying that although the secretary of state’s office has found isolated cases of fraud — such as one manvoting twicein the 2020 election — ”there wasno widespread voter fraudduring the 2020 or 2022 election cycles.” The regulations approved Monday also include a measure governing the process of hand counting ballots — codifying a similar regulationtemporarily approved last yearamid plans to hand count votes in some rural counties. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, Nevada Republicansled a charge againstsimilar, largely technical regulations that they described as an “election law power grab.” In a “call to action” sent to members Sunday, the Clark County Republican Party pilloried several of the proposed regulations, criticizing Democrats for not hearing Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’selection billduring the legislative session, while claiming they are now “trying to change our election again.” The Nevada GOP similarlycalled upon membersto submit testimony “directly against bad election regulations.” In the Monday meeting, members of the public calling in to testify primarily attacked the state’s mail ballot laws and a law requiring the state to hold a presidential preference primary for each major party, despite Wlaschin’s reminders that regulations cannot change state law. Nevada Republicans aresuing the stateover the planned presidential primary and plan tohold a caucusto allocate delegates. The secretary of state’s routine process of adopting regulations occurs prior to each election. In this case, the regulations relate to the presidential preference primaries set to be held for each major party on Feb. 6, 2024. Read below for more information about the new elections regulations adopted by the secretary of state’s office. MONDAY REGULATIONS The Nevada GOP described the first portion of this regulation as “forcing each county to waste local taxpayer funds on printing unsolicited mass mail ballots for a meaningless primary that has no bearing on who is elected president.” The state Republican Partyplans to hold a presidential caucuson Feb. 8 — two days after the primary — to award its delegates, and has sought to block the state from holding the primary through a lawsuitrejectedby a Carson City District Court judge and appealed to the state Supreme Court. Republican National Committeeman Jim DeGraffenreid expanded on the party’s argument against the regulation Monday, calling the primary “meaningless and optional for the parties.” Though the presidential primary is not binding on how a party awards its delegates,state lawstipulates that a presidential preference primary election “must be held” for major political parties, unless there is only one or no qualified candidate for that party. State lawalso requires county clerks to send registered voters a mail ballot prior to every election — including presidential primaries. Separately, Wlaschin said the secretary of state’s office would not provide information about the party-run caucus to voters, and would instead direct them to reach out to county and state party leadership for information. “The voter education and outreach efforts that the office of the secretary of state will undertake are in no way related to informing or educating voters about private party businesses and processes,” he said. The adopted definition of a hand count describes it as the “process of determining the results of an election where the primary method of counting the votes cast for each candidate or ballot question does not involve the use of a mechanical voting system.” That means a count that relies primarily on mechanical tabulation will not be considered a hand count, even if election officials also decide to hand count all ballots,as Nye County election workers didduring the general election last year. For local governments that rely on a hand count to determine their election results, the regulation sets forth strict requirements for conducting that count, including submitting plans 90 days before the election that cover the procedures, location, equipment, personnel, security and contingency plans to meet election deadlines. The Nevada GOP in its “call to action” about the regulatory hearings described this regulation as a “blatent (sic) targeting of counties that prefer to count ballots by hand rather than machines.” Some voter advocacy groups, meanwhile, asked for stronger restrictions and highlighted the dangers associated with hand counting, including ahigher error rateand greater labor resources required for a hand count. “It permits counties to bypass these very regulations, as it was done previously by merely engaging in a parallel process of counting the ballots. It does not ensure secure handling and accurate reading of ballots. It does not provide any remedies if there was a failure to comply with the regulations. And I think there are many more concerns to note,” said Sadmira Ramic, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada. Wlaschin noted that, to date, “no Nevada county intends to do this without a mechanical tabulation to ensure accurate results.” Read the full set of regulations adopted Mondayhere. TUESDAY REGULATIONS Read the full set of regulations adopted Tuesdayhere. WEDNESDAY REGULATIONS Wlaschin said there have been cases of voters attempting to vote twice through EASE and that the regulation does not change state law that makes voting more than once illegal, but he noted that some voters using EASE may deal with internet or computer difficulties and are unable to determine whether their first ballot was properly submitted. Wlaschin said secretary of state’s office staff have had “a lengthy discussion” with voters and county officials about the signature curing process, noting that in 2022, nearly 18,000 ballots needed a signature cure — which can occur when a voter’s signature does not match their signature on file, and can be resolved by a voter confirming they filled out and returned that ballot — and nearly 6,000 were left uncured. Alongside the potential for expanded hours for signature curing, Wlaschin emphasized the importance of voters having an email address or phone number on file, which helps county officials more easily reach a voter for signature curing.Read the full set of regulations adopted Wednesdayhere.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-opponent-seeks-longshot-14th-amendment-case-to-bar-him-from-nevada-ballot,True,"A Texas man filed suit in federal district court in Nevada this week seeking to bar former President Donald Trump from the state’s 2024 ballot using the 14th Amendment to the Constitution — a longshot legal bid that comes on the heels of a broader national effort to pressure secretaries of state to explore whether or not the amendment’s “insurrection” clause could keep Trump from winning office. Thelawsuitcomes alongside anotherhigh-profile effortled by six Republican and unaffiliated Colorado voters, who earlier this week sued to block Trump from the state’s ballot — a case that Trump’s team is activelyfightingagainst. It also marks an escalation of such efforts in Nevada, moving them from public statements into the legal system. In late June, a pair of national, politically focused nonprofits — Free Speech For People and Mi Familia Vota Education Fund —announcedthey had sent aletterto Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, calling on the Democratic elections official to bar Trump from the ballot. “The U.S. Constitution is clear that anyone who takes an oath of office and then engages in insurrection is forever barred from holding public office again. Secretary Aguilar must carry out his duty, follow this constitutional mandate and bar Trump from the ballot,” Alexandra Flores-Quilty, campaign director for Free Speech For People, said in the announcement. The Nevada lawsuit, meanwhile, was filed by John Anthony Castro, who is running as a write-in candidate for the GOP presidential nomination and who has filedsimilar lawsuitsin other states, most recently includingMaineandUtah. Castro, a vocal Trumpcriticwho had made multiple unsuccessful runs for office in Texas, is representing himself in the lawsuit, though he is not registered with the state Bar associations of Nevada or Texas. Candidate filing for presidential candidates runs in Nevada from Oct. 2-16. However, a push by the state GOP to run a separate caucus and eschew the primary altogether — a caucus someopponents sayis meant to favor Trump — makes a Trump filing next month unlikely, and a resolution to the legal question of his eligibility unclear. When asked for comment on the new lawsuit, a spokesperson for Aguilar directedThe Nevada Independentto a previous comment in August, which said that no candidates have yet filed for the presidential primary because filing has not opened. “All candidates for office must comply with statutes regarding qualifications, which includes qualifications as required by the Constitution,” the spokesperson, Cecilia Heston, said at the time. “The process for challenging a candidate’s qualifications may only begin after the candidate files for office and is adjudicated by the court, not this office.” If Trump does not file for the primary in favor of the caucus, and if he becomes the GOP nominee, the Republican Party may not submit his name for the ballot until just weeks before the general election. In 2020, candidates for president were not submitted to the secretary of state until Sept. 1 according to theoffice’s website. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson toldABC Newsthat she and other secretaries of state from Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Hampshire and Maine started having conversations more than a year ago about the potential legal challenges to Trump's candidacy. Ratified following the Civil War, the wide-ranging 14th Amendment includes the so-called “insurrection” clause, which bars from office any person who “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” after taking the oath of office. Little-used since Reconstruction and more recently legally untested, the clause has gained steam among Trump’s opponents — both liberal andconservative— after a pair of conservative law professors found the clausecould apply to Trumpbecause of his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Still, the potential success of any challenge to Trump’s eligibility remains a legal unlikelihood, and any such challenge would likely face appeal from the Trump campaign. On Friday, for instance, lawyers for Trump asked to have the Colorado casemoved to federal court— raising the possibility of a final judgment from a U.S. Supreme Court dominated 6-3 by conservative justices, including three nominated by Trump.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/desantis-super-pac-calls-nevada-gop-primary-rigged-for-trump-other-candidates-shy-away-from-state,True,"The super PAC backing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign is calling the state Republican Party’s decision to hold a caucus as evidence that it has “rigged” the primary to ensure an early state victory for former President Donald Trump. The Nevada GOPplans to holda party-sponsored presidential caucus on Feb. 8 — two days after the state-run presidential primary on Feb. 6. The state GOP has said it will award delegates to the winner of the caucus, and is asking candidates to not participate in the primary. Never Back Down, the super PAC backing DeSantis, criticized that decision in announcing that it was suspending door knocking operations in Nevada. “Unfortunately, state GOP leaders are so obsessed with appeasing Trump that they’ve rigged their primary to prioritize Trump above their own voters,” a Never Back Down official toldThe Nevada Independent. “They’re eliminating important grassroots processes which doesn’t benefit voters, only Donald Trump, so it doesn’t make logical sense to continue spending resources on grassroots efforts like door-knocking in the state.” The super PAC’s decision,first reported byNBC News, comes amid potential voter confusion over which contest to participate in and eroding candidate interest in the state, which has already receivedfar less attentionthan fellow early states Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Candidate filing for the party-run caucus opened on Sept. 1 and runs through Oct. 15, while filing for the state-run primary will take place between Oct. 2-16. The Nevada Independentreached out to the campaigns of 10 other GOP presidential hopefuls; only one responded as to whether they would participate in either the caucus or primary — Vivek Ramaswamy. “We will be going for delegates,” said Ramaswamy adviser Tricia McLaughlin. “Under the current version of the rules, that’s the caucus.” The Trump campaignsupportsthe caucus efforts and hired the state party’s former executive director asits state director. The Nevada GOP did not respond to a request for a list of candidates who have filed for the caucus thus far. The competing contests have at least one engaged Republican voter confused — Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), the state’s only federally elected Republican. In an interview, Amodei said he had spent the past five weeks of congressional recess meeting with various groups across the state, where he heard lots of questions about how voters are supposed to participate. “Right now, [there] is a hell of a lot of confusion,” he said. “And by the way, you can put me in that camp as well.” Amodei said he has not yet discussed the issue with Nevada GOP chair Michael McDonald, but that he hopes the state party involves the county parties in the caucus to resolve gaps in understanding at the voter level. And he said he doesn’t blame campaigns for focusing elsewhere. “I can certainly see somebody going, we’re going to put our money somewhere we know what the rules are, and we can have the best chance of getting a result,” he said. The state-run primary will be held in accordance with a2021 law, signed by then-Gov. Steve Sisolak, setting a date for a presidential primary and ending the state’s traditional caucus. Nevada was one ofthree statesto use a caucus system in 2020. The Nevada GOP, wanting to hold a caucus,sued the stateto block the primary — an effort supported by the Trump campaign, which has been involved in efforts to change nominating contest rules in state parties across the country, according toReuters. The case is still inlitigation. Campaigns will be faced with a dilemma over which process to participate in. The caucus will award the state’s 26 delegates, which make up about 1 percent of the total estimated delegates. But given Nevada’s small delegate total, a strong performance in the state could give a candidate momentum heading into Super Tuesday, especially given that the primary results will be reported first. There are also notable differences between the two; both are only open to registered Republicans, but the primary will feature a week of early voting, mail ballots distributed by Jan. 17 and same-day voter registration.Caucus-goers, meanwhile, must present voter ID and participate in meetings at precinct locations at 5 p.m. that day. For the caucus, absentee voting is only available to active duty military members and their dependents. McDonald, a longtime Trump ally who was deeply involved in the campaign’s effort to overturn the 2020 election,toldNBC Newsthat the move to host a caucus is about protecting the party from election fraud rather than advantaging Trump. “We have to make sure that we're able to have a transparent election,” he said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/assemblywoman-and-reno-council-member-join-race-for-key-reno-area-state-senate-seat,True,"AssemblywomanAngie Taylor (D-Reno)and longtime Reno City Council member Naomi Duerr announced plans Thursday to run for Senate District 15 in 2024, setting up a Democratic primary challenge in a key legislative seat closely eyed by both political parties. The two Democrats are competing for the seat of Sen. Heidi Seevers Gansert (R-Reno), who announced in early August that she would not run for re-election in order to spend more time with her family. No Republican candidates have announced. The Reno-area district was a top target of Democrats during the 2021 redistricting process — thenew mapsshifted the Democratic voter registration advantage in the district from roughly 1 percentage point to roughly 7 points — and is among the key battleground districts that will determine Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s ability to dictate what policies from the Legislature become law. Taylor, who spent eight years on the Washoe County School Board, enters with the backing of top legislative Democrats — including Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro (D-Las Vegas) and Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) — who praised the first-term assemblywoman in statements released Thursday. “Angie has been a tireless advocate for Washoe County for more than 30 years. Last session, she led the charge on a bipartisan school safety bill, passed the largest K-12 education budget in state history, and fought to lower the cost of prescription drugs,” Cannizzarro said in a press release. Duerr, a geologist by training who was first elected to the Reno City Council in 2014, said in an announcement posted to herpersonal Facebook pagethat she launched her Senate campaign “to take my passion for serving the public to the next level.” The announcements come as Democrats seek to bolster their legislative majorities in 2024 and secure a veto-proof supermajority in both chambers. Democrats already hold a 28-seat majority in the 42-member Assembly, and are just one seat short of the 14 seats needed for a supermajority in the 21-member Senate. Senate District 15 — which includes much of the northern and western edges of urban and suburban Reno — has long been a GOP stronghold. Since 2016, it has been represented by Seevers Gansert, who also spent three terms in the Assembly and served as former Gov. Brian Sandoval’s chief of staff. In their press release, Democrats touted the district’s “strong Democratic lean” by noting that former Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, won the district by more than 14 points during the 2022 election. During the last election cycle, all candidates endorsed by the Senate Democrats won their respective primary elections.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/teacher-led-pac-files-petition-to-block-public-funding-for-as-stadium-in-vegas,True,"An effort to halt the public financing package approved by Nevada lawmakers in June for a Major League Baseball stadium in Las Vegas formally launched Wednesday when a political action committee formed by the statewide teachers union filed a referendum petition with the secretary of state’s office. The campaign, “Schools Over Stadiums,” wants voters to repeal the $380 million in financing lawmakers agreed to in a special session following contentious legislative hearings with representatives of the Oakland Athletics. The team is seeking to relocate to Las Vegas. The PACwas launched in Juneby the Nevada State Education Association following the approval ofSB1, which authorized financing to the A’s toward the construction of a 33,000-seat ballpark on the Las Vegas Strip. “Schools Over Stadiums has been committed to pursuing every possible path to stop the use of public funds to subsidize a billionaire’s stadium and that has always included putting the question to Nevada voters who were effectively shut out of the process,” NSEA President Dawn Etcheverry said in a statement. “Nevada’s priorities are misguided and when we launched Schools Over Stadiums in June, our goal was to ensure that public funds go to the services Nevadans depend on like our public schools, not to a California billionaire for a stadium.” NSEA spokesman Alexander Marks said PAC has not yet hired a signature-gathering firm for the effort. “We have been in conversations with several firms, and we will be working with our volunteers in the meantime,” Marks said. An A’s spokesperson could not be reached for comment. To get an initiative or referendum on the ballot that proposes or repeals language for state law, a petitioner must obtain signatures from at least 10 percent of the voters in the previous general election — meaning that at least 102,586 signatures are needed. At least 25,647 signatures would need to come from each of the state’s four congressional districts. The petitioners must collect and submit signatures by July 8, 2024. If a petition receives enough signatures and a simple majority of Nevadans vote in favor of the corresponding ballot question, it would pass and change state law. After muchdiscussionand severalamendments, lawmakerspassedthe bill that committed up to $380 million in public financing through a combination of tax credits and county-issued bonds. The proposed $1.5 billion baseball stadium is set to be built on 9 acres of a 35-acre parcel that houses the Tropicana hotel and casino. The special session took place after lawmakers failed to pass a stadium funding bill in the regular 120-day session on account of abudget standoffbetween the governor and Democratic legislative leaders. The A’s are waiting for Major League Baseball to approve the team’s relocation request. The proposed stadium in Las Vegas is not expected to be ready until the start of the 2028 major league season. In its statement, the NSEA said state lawmakers “failed to hear a single bill to reduce Nevada’s overcrowded classrooms.” “This referendum petition will target specific parts of Senate Bill 1 to strip public funding for the proposed stadium regardless of what state and county officials agree to do in any sort of development deal,” Marks said in a statement. NSEA, a branch of the National Education Association that has affiliates in every Nevada school district but is not recognized as the formal bargaining unit for a majority of the state's teachers, might be going at it alone in the effort to repeal the legislation that saw wide support from unions across the state, including Culinary Workers Local 226 and the Nevada State AFL-CIO. The A’spreviously signeda project labor agreement with the Southern Nevada Building Trades covering the stadium and has an agreement with the Culinary to organize the ballpark’s employees. The team was the title sponsor for the Nevada AFL-CIO convention at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno last month. The Clark County Education Association (CCEA), which is not affiliated with NSEA and is the official bargaining unit for 18,000 licensed educators, including teachers, in the Clark County School District, is not backing the petition. CCEA and the statewide union have been at odds since 2018 when the formerbroke off from NSEA. “We’re not involved, and we wouldn’t follow the lead of an irrelevant organization,” Clark County Education Association Executive Director John Vellardita said in June, adding that Democrats passed the bill, a Republican governor signed it, and the stadium seems like a settled matter.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/2024-house-races-las-vegas-districts-again-in-spotlight-as-gop-seeks-to-unseat-democratic-incumbents,True,"The battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives will again run through Las Vegas, where three of the state’s four congressional districts were decided by less than 6 points in 2022. The three Southern Nevada districts — represented by Democratic Reps. Dina Titus, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford — are all on the National Republican Congressional Committee’s (NRCC)target list. Similarly, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) hasidentifiedLee and Horsford as participants in its Frontline program aimed at defending competitive seats. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), meanwhile, won his last election in his solidly red Northern Nevada-based district by more than 20 points, making his seat safe. Amodei told members of the Carson City Chamber of Commerce last week thathe would seek another term in 2024. The three Las Vegas districts wereredrawnby legislative Democrats in 2021 to give each one a slight Democratic majority in registered voters, changing the boundaries of the solidly blue 1st District to make it more competitive while shoring up Democratic advantages in the other two districts. The strategy paid off in 2022, with each Democrat winning re-election by between 4 and 6 points. While the NRCC does not endorse in primaries, it is engaged in recruitment and messaging efforts in Las Vegas as it tries to defend and expand its narrow five-seat House majority. Here's more on Nevada’s House Democrats and their Republican challengers: Democrats refresher At this point, none of Nevada’s House Democrats are new to politics. That’s especially true for Titus, previously a longtime state senator who is in her seventh (nonconsecutive) term in the House. Titus represents the 1st District — a majority-minority district that includes the Strip and parts of southeast Clark County, including Boulder City and most of Henderson. While still early in the cycle, Titus has raised just over $281,000 — well below totals reported by other incumbents in battleground seats. She’ll receive support from the DCCC as well as a host of Democratic-aligned groups, but her paltry fundraising totals are worth noting given state Democrats typically outraise Republican challengers. Lee, who represents a district encompassing the western part of Las Vegas, Summerlin South and southern Clark County down to Laughlin, has posted strong fundraising totals this year. She raised nearly $1.1 million through June, giving her a strong start while Republicans duke it out in a primary. Now in her third term, Lee has begun to climb into some leadership roles, serving as vice chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers’ Caucus and the whip of the center-left New Democrats. Finally, Horsford — a former state Senate majority leader — has increased his national profile in his fourth term as the chair of the influential Congressional Black Caucus, making him the congressional face of a powerful constituency. The post widens Horsford’s fundraising pool — he hosted a fundraiser at a Beyoncé concert earlier this month. Horsford has raised just over $1 million thus far this cycle. Republican challengers None of the Republican challengers in 2022 were able to take advantage of a midterm environment that experts predicted would favor them. This time around, Republicans are hoping to close the fundraising gap between their challengers and the Democratic incumbents, and best navigate a crowded media environment that will be dominated by presidential and Senate advertising. Campaigning in Las Vegas has become acostly propositionin recent cycles, with both the 1st and 3rd Districts placing among the most expensive House races in the country in 2022. And with a number of unique attributes — a highly transient population, Clark County split into three districts, and a propensity of voters who work nontraditional hours and require creative outreach beyond standard paid media appeals — cash goes a long way in getting out the vote. In the 1st District, potential Titus challengers include her unsuccessful 2022 challenger Mark Robertson, a retired U.S. Army Colonel who is running again, restaurant owner Flemming Larsen, or businessman Ron Quince. All three have previously run for office. Larsen has the advantage of a significant self-funding operation; he has loaned his campaign $650,000, contributing to a cash-on-hand advantage of more than $350,000 over Titus. Larsen lost a close Assembly race in 2022 to Democrat Max Carter II by just under 2 points. Hiswebsiteis already focused on the general election, dinging Titus on everything from border security to water access to being a career politician. The 3rd District has the most ready-made candidate: AssemblywomanHeidi Kasama(R-Las Vegas). Representing South Summerlin and Southwest Las Vegas in the Legislature, Kasama, a longtime real estate broker, should have the backing of high-powered real estate players and already has the most prominent endorsement of the cycle — astamp of approvalfrom Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. Kasama will face policy analyst Drew Johnson and former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien in what is shaping up to be amessy primary. Johnson has the endorsement of several of Kasama’s Republican colleagues in the Legislature and state Controller Andy Matthews. Finally, Horsford, who was the biggest beneficiary of redistricting and now has the most Democrat-leaning district among the three, only has one declared challenger thus far — retired U.S. Army Air Force Llt. Col. David Flippo, who has raised just shy of $138,000. Flippo’s biggest headline thus far has been aTwitter gaffein which he shared a photo of an African village claiming it was the U.S. border — a snafu that made it intoPolitico. But with still 11 months to go until the Republican primary, strategists expect more candidates to emerge.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/2024-senate-race-growing-field-of-republican-challengers-look-to-unseat-jacky-rosen,True,"Vying to challenge incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and disrupt Democrats’ recent strong run of electoral success in a historically purple state, eight candidates have entered the race for the GOP Senate nomination. They’re aiming to become the first Republican to win a U.S. Senate race in Nevada since former Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in 2012. Just one of those challengers —Jim Marchant, a former Assemblyman who lost races in 2020 for Congress and in 2022 for secretary of state — has ever won an election in Nevada. But months away from the June 2024 primary election,Sam Brown, a retired U.S. Army captain whosuffered severe burnswhile deployed in Afghanistan, entered this year’s race with momentum from a second-place finish in last year’s Republican Senate primary and support from national Republicans. With no other statewide races on the ballot next year (sans ballot questions), the Senate race is likely to draw major spending. Nevada’s 2022 U.S. Senate race setrecordsfor campaign spending in the Silver State, as national Democratic groups and out-of-state donors helped boost Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) as she won a narrow 8,000-vote victory (less than 1 percentage point) over Republican former Attorney General Adam Laxalt. That race saw more than $200 million in combined spending from candidates and outside groups,according to OpenSecrets, a nonprofit research group that tracks money in U.S. politics. In a closely divided U.S. Senate, where Democrats (and Democrat-aligned independents) hold a slim 51-49 majority, defending Rosen’s seat will be a key priority to maintaining that advantage. Even as Republicans are seeking to flip atrioof Democrat-held seats in red states — West Virginia, Montana and Ohio — Nevada is still considered a keybattlegroundand atargetfor Republicans. Last year, voters in the Silver State re-elected Cortez Masto while lifting Republican Joe Lombardo to the governor’s mansion. Here's more on Rosen and her Republican challengers: Jacky Rosen refresher In 2016, Rosen was a political unknown. The longtime Henderson resident and former software programmer served at the time as president ofCongregation Ner Tamid, Nevada’s largest Reform synagogue. Recruitedby then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Rosen ran and won a race that year for the swingy Congressional District 3 seat. Just six months into her term in the lower chamber, sheannounceda bid for Senate, again encouraged by Reid to make therun. In 2018, Rosen achieved anunexpected 5-point winover the incumbent, Heller, and since then, she’stouted herselfin the Senate as a bipartisan problem solver, unafraid to point to herrankingfrom the Lugar Center as one of the top 10 most bipartisan members of the Senate.Data fromFiveThirtyEightshows Rosen was one of the least likely Democrats to vote in line with Biden’s position during the 2021-22 Congress, though she did so 92.5 percent of the time. And despite Republicans’ propensity for attacking Nevada’s congressional Democrats for their ties to President Joe Biden — who remainsunpopularin the state — Rosen isn’t shying away from the president.The Messenger’s Dan Merica explored Rosen’s embrace of recent Democratic legislative victories, from the Inflation Reduction Act to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, in astory on her candidacythat included confirmation she would happily campaign with Biden on the trail. She’s also proven her fundraising strength, ending June with arecord$7.5 million in the bank. Growing Republican field Across the aisle, Brown and Marchant are leading the growing field of Republican challengers — most of whom are unlikely to be able to compete infundraising with Brown, who has the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. An earlypollcommissioned by a pro-Brown super PAC found Brown, who moved to Nevada from Texas in 2018, in the lead in the primary field — though a larger share of voters were still undecided. Most candidates in the race have similar positions on policy issues — from supporting Trump’s border wall to criticizing Democrats for excess government spending and inflation. Marchant, a prominent election denier and fervent Trump supporter, hasframedthe race as “MAGA vs. establishment,” a reference to the institutional support for Brown, who has declined to endorse Trump instead offering support for whichever candidate becomes the GOP nominee. My colleague Jacob Solis has adeeper diveinto Marchant’s history and political positions from his run for secretary of state last year. To learn more about Brown, catch up on ourinterview with himfrom shortly after he announced his candidacy. Also in the running is retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Tony Grady, who finished second in the GOP primary for lieutenant governor last year. Gabe Stern has more on Grady forAP Newshere. Jeff Gunter, a dermatologist and a former Trump-appointed U.S. ambassador to Iceland, also joined the fray earlier this month.

For more,The Daily BeastandPoliticohave details on Gunter’srocky tenure as a diplomatand history of Democratic voterregistration in California. Others in the race include real estate agent Stephanie Phillips, attorney Ronda Kennedy and a pair of candidates who, like Brown, ran in the 2022 Senate race: retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Bill Conrad, who received 1.5 percent of the vote in the GOP primary, and businessman Barry Lindemann, who, as a nonpartisan, received 0.8 percent of the vote in the general election.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/pro-sam-brown-group-polling-finds-him-leading-gop-senate-field-many-undecided,True,"Retired U.S. Army Capt. Sam Brown is the leading Republican candidate to take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) next year, according to a newpollof likely GOP primary election voters conducted by Public Opinion Strategies on behalf of Duty First Nevada, a super PAC supporting Brown. Despite Brown’s lead over the Republican field, the largest group of poll respondents, 44 percent of the 500 likely voters surveyed, were undecided among the growing field of GOP U.S. Senate candidates. The poll, first reported onbyPoliticoon Monday, was conducted via phone calls from Aug. 15-17, nearly 10 months away from the June 2024 primary election. The survey found 33 percent of respondents said they would vote for Brown in a hypothetical primary matchup, followed by 15 percent who would vote for former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. None of the other five candidates listed — retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Tony Grady, former Trump-appointed U.S. ambassador to Iceland Jeff Gunter, attorney Ronda Kennedy, retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Bill Conrad and businessman Barry Lindemann, who ran for Senate last year as a nonpartisan — received support from more than 3 percent of respondents. The poll had a margin of error of 4.38 percent. Glen Bolger, a partner and co-founder at Public Opinion Strategies, a national political research firmratedas a “B+” pollster byFiveThirtyEight, said Brown’s level of support was an indication that his previous campaign made a “positive impression.” Last year, Brown finished second to Adam Laxalt in the Republican Senate primary. “This is higher name ID than I expected him to have,” Bolger said of Brown. Even months out from the election, Bolger noted that this type of early polling “makes it easier for the [leading] candidate to raise money [and] makes it harder for other candidates to raise money and attract support.” Duty First Nevada, the pro-Brown super PAC that commissioned the poll,launchedin August and has not yet been required to report its campaign finance activity. Faith Jones, Brown’s campaign manager, said in a statement that “Brown is immensely grateful that conservatives across the state are uniting to support his race for the U.S. Senate.” Marchant’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Brown and Marchant both benefited in the poll from their stronger name recognition among primary voters. Sixty-five percent of respondents said they had heard of Brown — who entered this year’s race with institutional support from congressional Republicans including National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) — and 38 percent of respondents rated him favorably, compared with 3 percent who rated him unfavorably. A similar share of voters, 61 percent, said they had heard of Marchant, who previously ran unsuccessfully for Congress and secretary of state. But just 25 percent expressed a favorable view of him, and 6 percent rated him unfavorably. “Brown’s favorables are higher than his opponents, and that is translated directly into ballot support,” Bolger said. The poll also showed Brown had a higher level of support in Washoe County and from respondents in rural Nevada, while his lead over Marchant was relatively lower among Clark County Republicans at 11 points (28 percent to 17 percent). Behind Brown and Marchant, less than one-fifth of respondents said they had heard of any of the other candidates. The only other candidate who received more than 1 percent was Grady, who finished second in the Republican primary for lieutenant governor last year and clocked in at third in the poll with 2.2 percent support. Gunter, who entered the race only days before the poll was conducted, received support from 1 percent of respondents, sitting at about the same level as Kennedy, Conrad and Lindemann. Real estate agent Stephanie Phillips was the only Republican candidate not included in the poll. In astatementreleased Monday night, Gunter described the poll as “fake,” also attacking Brown and saying the early polling “doesn’t even show him ahead” — referring to the large number of undecided voters polled, despite Brown’s lead over other candidates. Also looming over the primary is former President Donald Trump, who 85 percent of respondents rated favorably in the poll. While Marchant and Gunter have ardently supported the Republican presidential frontrunner, Brown has declined to endorse Trump, instead saying he will support whoever becomes the party’s nominee. In last year’s race, Trump endorsed Laxalt, who lost to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) in the general election. Bolger noted there will still be an opportunity for candidates to rise if they can raise a “significant amount of money” and spread their message. “People can become competitive if they can get their messaging out in a significant way,” Bolger said. “They've got a long time to do it, but … Sam Brown is definitely in the driver's seat, and they're certainly hoping to get into the back of the truck.” To view the poll crosstabs,click here.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-lawmaker-heidi-kasama-to-run-for-congress-challenge-susie-lee,True,"Second-term Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas) announced plans Monday to run for Nevada’s Congressional District 3, pledging to focus her campaign on education, economic development and public safety. The battleground district, held by Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), includes parts of southwestern Las Vegas and a significant portion of unincorporated Clark County. Hotly contested in past election cycles,voter registrationdata indicates the district has a Democratic registered voter lean of 5.5 percentage points. “Today we see more crime, higher living expenses, and uncontrolled health care costs. Students are graduating with a lack of basic education and are unprepared to enter the workforce. There is a basic lack of accountability and personal responsibility,” Kasma said in a press release. “This is not the American way of life I grew up with. I will fight hard to change the direction of our country for the sake of my grandchildren and all Nevadans.” Although Democrats have controlled Congressional District 3 since the 2016 election, the seat is often one of the state’s most-watched battleground districts with the race often rated as atoss-upamong election analysts. Lee, first elected to the seat in 2018,defeated Republican April Beckerin the 2022 election by about 4 percentage points. Kasama said in her announcement she was motivated to run for the seat to help Nevadans achieve the American Dream, an essential part of her childhoodas the daughter of immigrants from Norway. She added that her husband is an immigrant from Japan and has benefited from the same opportunities as she and her parents. Kasama is the managing broker of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties and manages Kasama Property Management, a real estate brokerage she founded in 2014. During her time in the real estate industry, she also served as the president of the Nevada REALTORS. Before she joined the real estate community, she worked as a certified public accountant. She was elected to the Assembly in 2020 and re-elected in 2022, representing portions of South Summerlin and Southwest Las Vegas. Shortly after Kasama’s announcement, fellow GOP candidate Drew Johnson “welcomed” Kasama to the race in a press release, calling her a “Republican In Name Only” (RINO) and saying he looked forward to “exposing” her liberal record during the primary. Former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien is also running for the congressional seat in the Republican primary. Helgelien was the youngest person elected to the Senate in 2010, resigning in 2012 after less than one term following a divorce and child custody battle.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/after-judge-denies-gop-request-to-block-presidential-primary-party-appeals-to-nevada-supreme-court,True,"The Nevada Republican Party filed an appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking to block the state from holding a presidential primary election next year after a Carson City judgedeniedthe party’s case in District Court,court filingsobtained byThe Nevada Independentshow. The Nevada GOP’s efforts to block the Republican primary come as the partyplans toconduct a caucus on Feb. 8 — two days after the state-run primaries — to allocate the state’s presidential delegates. In 2021, a bipartisan group of Nevada lawmakersapprovedalawshifting the state’s presidential nominating system from a caucus model, now used in only a few states, to a primary model that is run by state and local election officials instead of the major parties and that follows state election laws, such as universal mail voting. But Nevada Republicans have resisted the change, seeking this year toblockthe law and pledging to maintain the caucus system from past election cycles. Republican National Committeewoman Sigal Chattah, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Nevada GOP, said in an interview Thursday that “taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for a primary that is completely irrelevant.” To learn more about the presidential primaries and the Nevada Republican Party’s plans for the 2024 presidential caucus,read here. During a hearing last month, Carson City District Court Judge James Russell was unswayed by Chattah’s arguments. Hedeniedthe lawsuit, saying he did not think the Nevada GOP would suffer “any irreparable harm” as a result of the primary because the election is “non-binding,” meaning the party is not bound to award delegates based on the results of the primary. Chattah argued that because all sides,including the state, have acknowledged the primary is non-binding, there is no point in moving forward with the primary. Thestate lawpassed in 2021 stipulates, “a presidential preference primary election must be held for all major political parties on the first Tuesday in February of each presidential election year,” unless there is only one or no qualified candidate for that party. In response to a reporter reading the law, Chattah said Thursday, “then we get into statutory interpretation.” During the hearing, Russell said through his research of similar cases he found no examples to support the Nevada GOP’s arguments. “I'm just astounded because we did research … and we found nothing to support your position,” Russell said. “I just want some authority, so I can see if we can help you, but I don't think — we couldn't find any authority to help you.” Russell also acknowledged that there could be some confusion generated by the process of having both a primary and a caucus for the same set of voters. However, he said he thinks “that's far outweighed by the generation of interest in the primary as a whole.” He framed the primary as a way of allowing voters to voice their preference, even if the result is not binding. “Doesn't that at least give the caucus some indication of basically what the voters in that state want?” he asked Chattah. It will likely be at least several weeks before the case moves fully through the appeal process. Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit at the Supreme Court, the party is separately seeking to restrict candidates from participating in the primary. Nevada GOP Chairman Michael McDonald confirmed toThe Nevada Independenton Thursday that candidates who file to run in the primary will be barred from participating in the caucus, meaning they would be ineligible to win delegates at the national convention later in the year. If two or more candidates file to run in the primary, the state will still be required to conduct the election. McDonald also said the party is charging a “ballot access fee” of $55,000 for candidates to run in the caucus, though they can get a discount of $20,000 if they participate in a joint event with the state party, such as a fundraiser. Beyond that, the party will play a role in educating its voters about which election will determine the allocation of delegates.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/gop-senate-leader-heidi-seevers-gansert-wont-run-for-re-election-in-2024,True,"After nearly two decades in Nevada politics, Republican Senate Minority Leader Heidi Seevers Gansert (R-Reno) toldThe Nevada Independentthat she will not run for re-election in her competitive Northern Nevada Senate district in 2024, leaving her seat open for the first time since 2016. Selected as the Senate minority leader for the 2023 legislative session, Seevers Gansert, 60, was among the most powerful Republican lawmakers in Carson City last session, wielding a caucus just large enough to block measures, such as tax increases, that required two-thirds passage. Her decision not to run for a third term in the Senate comes both as Washoe County has drifted toward the Democratic Party over the last half-decade — and as Democrats in Carson City have vastly expanded their routes to supermajorities throughthe 2021 redistricting process. That process included redrawing Seevers Gansert’s district to leanmore heavily toward Democratic candidates, raising the Democratic voter registration advantage over Republicans from roughly 1 point to more than 6 points. With her exit from state politics, the district — whichincludeslarge swaths of Reno’s northern, western and southern edges — will become one of the most important legislative races in the state in the 2024 election, as Democrats look to flip at least one Senate seat needed to create a veto-proof supermajority that could stymie Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s legislative agenda. Seevers Gansert, an engineer by training and mother of four adult children, said in an interview late Monday that though her decision came for “many reasons,” the “most important one is family.” Just before the 2023 legislative session began earlier this year, Seevers Gansert learned her daughter was expecting her first child — the senator’s first grandchild. “That's when I just decided I needed to reprioritize and have more flexibility,” Seevers Gansert said. To that end, Seevers Gansert downplayed the possibility of any additional runs for office in the near future. That included when asked if she would serve in Lombardo’s administration — “I’m not looking for anything right now,” she said — or whether she might throw her hat into theincreasingly crowdedRepublican primary for Nevada’s 2024 U.S. Senate race — “I've been asked numerous times whether I was going to run for U.S. Senate and I really am focusing on family.” “I spent most of the last 20 years in the public arena,” she said. “And there comes a time when you feel like you've done what you wanted to accomplish, and I feel like I've met or exceeded my expectations for public service. It's time to let someone else have a shot.” Seevers Gansert did not speculate on who might run to replace her in the state Senate. However, she added that she still believed she “would have been competitive” in 2024, and that the “right Republican” could still win her district even under “difficult” presidential election year conditions that traditionally boost turnout. “My track record demonstrates that I’ve never lost,” she said. ‘The public arena’ First elected to the Assembly in 2004, Seevers Gansert spent three terms in the state’s lower house, including becoming the GOP caucus leader during a tumultuous 2009 legislative session shaped by the Great Recession. By 2011, she had joined Gov. Brian Sandoval’s administration as the new governor’s first chief of staff, before leaving the public sector a year later for an administrative job at UNR. By 2016, Seevers Gansert returned to the campaign trail, winning the Reno-area Senate District 15 by 11 points. In 2020, she won re-election again — though this time in a much tighter contest, winning by just 3.6 points. Acrossdecades in public office, Seevers Gansert, in her interview, touted bipartisan work on children’s and women’s issues as some of her proudest accomplishments, including the creation of the SafeVoice app that allows students to report bullying; the state’s early literacy programs and defending existing funding for the Read by Grade 3 initiative; and a dual reporting system for schools, allowing schools to more easily track abusive teachers, coaches or aides across different institutions. She also touted bipartisan votes on women’s issues, including backing the Equal Rights Amendment in 2017, access to birth control for minors and preventive medicine for STIs — “I voted with women, and for women and for men and for kids,” she said. Those bipartisan votes frequently made her among the top lawmakers to cross party lines. That includes the 2023 legislative session, where shebroke with her own caucus 47 times, according to an analysis last month fromThe Nevada Independent. Seevers Gansert also lamented this year’s session as “more difficult” amid rising partisan differences — though she still touted the success ofSB375, a bill she sponsored along with legislative leaders in both parties and in both houses that would allocate $20 million in hopes of boosting the state’s nursing graduation rates by up to 50 percent in the next three years. “One thing that we can do to really improve access to care is to make sure that we support our nurses and the nursing programs,” she said. As the session closed, Seevers Gansert was at the center of a legislative fight that ended with theimplosion of budget negotiations, the scuttling of a major budget bill at the 11th hour and the governor calling anemergency special legislative sessionless than a day after the regular, 120-day session had ended. That fight came over a long-running dispute over potential dollars forcharter school funding, amid a historic boost to public K-12 schools and the withering of Republican and Lombardo-backed proposals to boost a school choice scholarship program. In the end, it was Seevers Gansert’s caucus voting as a bloc to kill the last budget bill that necessitated the special session — andlater finger-pointingas lawmakers came back for a final vote. But now nearly two months removed from that budget fight, Seevers Gansert said “it was worth it because we needed to bring more attention to the inequity between public charter schools and public school funding.” “I think there was a lot of frustration over public charter school funding, and driving us to the special session really helped increase awareness of the disparity between the two and I think it was just really important that an exclamation point was added to that,” she said. Asked if she was left with any regrets or policies left on the table, Seevers Gansert answered, “Not really.” “I feel like I accomplished more than I ever anticipated, and so I'm just very grateful to have served,” she said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-explains-nevadas-2024-presidential-primaries,True,"For the first time in more than four decades, Nevada will hold presidential primaries — rather than caucuses — on Feb. 6, 2024. The transition comes after a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled Legislature and Gov. Steve Sisolakapproveda 2021 lawrequiringthat a presidential preference primary election be held for each major political party on the first Tuesday in February of a presidential election year. But for Republican Party voters, the results from the primary won’t have any effect on apportioning the state’s presidential nominating delegates. The Nevada GOP plans to run a traditional caucus two days later on Feb. 8, to allocate the state’s delegates, and will not use the results from the primary election. The party’s decision to hold a caucus hassplit candidates. Former President Donald Trump is running in the caucus, and faces only Texas pastor Ryan Binkley after the exit of other high-profile candidates. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had filed to run in the caucus before dropping out of the race in January. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley opted to run in the primary — the only major candidate still in the race to do so. The new system is in part meant to increase participation in the partisan presidential nominating process, as the coming primary elections will see mail ballots sent to every voter registered with a major party — a stark contrast to the caucus system, that typically involves voters meeting in person and gathering in groups to openly cast votes for their preferred candidate through a complex delegate allocation plan. In 2020, Nevada was one of three states to stilluse the caucus system. On this year’s Democratic nominating calendar, Nevada falls third, after South Carolina on Feb. 3 and New Hampshire on Jan. 23 — though President Joe Bidenskipped the New Hampshire contestover a dispute about the state nominating order, with Biden pushing the Democratic National Committee toplace South Carolina first. With the caucus scheduled for Feb. 8, Nevada is still set to serve as an early state in the Republican National Committee’s (RNC) nomination process — behind traditional frontrunners Iowa and New Hampshire, but jumpingaheadof South Carolina. The Nevada GOP has been strongly opposed to the primary. In May 2023, the partyfiled a lawsuitto block the state from holding a presidential primary election (a case still beinglitigated). In September, the party approvedrules for its caucusthat prevent primary candidates from winning delegates. Unlike the caucus, Nevada’s presidential primaries will be run by state and local election officials using the same voting processes used in other elections — including secret ballots, mail voting and an early voting period. Read below for more details on Nevada’s new presidential preference primary systemand the Republican caucus. When are Nevada’s 2024 presidential preference primaries and the GOP caucus? The Silver State’s presidential primaries will be held Feb. 6, the first Tuesday in February. Understate law, early voting will lastone week, running from Saturday, Jan. 27, through Friday, Feb. 2. State law alsorequirespolling places to be open for at least four hours on Saturdays during early voting and at least eight hours on weekdays. Mail ballotsmustbe distributed by Jan. 17 — 20 days prior to Election Day. To receive and cast a mail ballot, a votermust registeras a Democrat or Republican by 5 p.m. on Jan. 23. The Nevada GOP is holding its caucus Feb. 8 — two days after the primaries conclude. The caucus will occur at 5 p.m. that Thursday evening and end that night,according to the party. Under the national Republican Party’srules, Nevada is one of four states — alongside Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina — allowed to conduct its presidential preference election prior to March 1. The rules also dictate that for states holding their elections prior to March 15, that state’s delegates must be allocated proportionally to votes. Who can vote in the presidential primaries? The presidential primary elections are considered closed primaries and are limited to major party voters (either Democrat or Republican), meaning those registered as nonpartisan or with a minor party are not eligible to vote in these elections. But same-day voter registration is in effect during the presidential primaries, which means someone who is otherwise eligible to vote can register with one of the major parties during the early voting period or on Election Day and vote in the Democratic or Republican primary. That includes nonpartisan voters, minor party voters and major party voters who are able to re-register as a Democrat or Republican on the day they vote. For the GOP caucus, only voters registered as Republicans will be able to participate. Voters must register as a Republican by Jan. 8 to participate,according to the party. The party also plans to require voters to show a government-issued ID to participate — a requirement that is not in place in government-run elections in Nevada. Who will be on the ballot in the presidential primaries? The Republican caucus field includes Trump and Binkley. The Democratic primary field includes Biden, self-help author Marianne Williamson and nearly a dozen other long-shot candidates. The Republican primary field includes Haley and several obscure candidates. The ballot also includes two major candidates who have suspended their presidential campaigns after the state’s deadline to withdraw from the ballot — former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC). Both primaries will also include an option of “none of these candidates” — a ballot option unique to Nevada that allows voters to participate without supporting a specific candidate. To qualify for the ballot, a candidatemustmeet the constitutionalrequirements— be a natural-born citizen of the U.S., be at least 35 years old and have been a resident of the U.S. for at least 14 years — and any rules of the major political party. The elections are also strictly limited to the selection of presidential nominees. Nevada’s other primary elections for offices such as U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives and local office will be held in June. How can a voter participate in the primaries and/or caucus? Nearly all of the more than 1.1 million voters registered as Democrats or Republicans will be mailed ballots in the weeks leading up to Feb. 6, only barring those few thousand who submitted a request to opt out of mail voting. Voters can return their ballot via mail or by dropping them in a ballot drop box. Ballots received by 5 p.m. on Feb. 10 (four days after the election) and postmarked by Election Day will be counted. Voters can also cast their ballots in person during early voting (Jan. 27 to Feb. 2) or on Election Day (Feb. 6). In-person voting locations will be postedhere. Certain tribal, military and overseas voters and Nevadans with disabilities can cast their ballot using the state’s Effective Absentee System For Elections (EASE), an online voting application that launched Dec. 23. Republican voters can participate in both the primary and caucus, with voting for the caucus limited to in-person caucus locations starting at 5 p.m. on Feb. 8. Caucus locations can be foundhere. During the caucus, participantswill be able tovote on a secret ballot and leave or can stay and participate in caucus meetings to select county convention delegates, a process set to begin around 6 p.m. What will the results of the primaries mean? The purpose of a party’s presidential preference primary is to award a state’s presidential delegates. Based on the votes a candidate receives, they are assigned a certain number of state delegates who will vote for them at their party's national convention. At the Republican National Convention, Nevada will have26delegates, about 1 percent of the estimated 2,467 Republican delegates. At the Democratic National Convention, the state will have48, representing more than 1 percent of theestimated4,514 delegates. Still, the results of the primaries are not technically binding. The Nevada GOP plans to allocate delegates based on the results of the caucus, while Nevada Democrats plan to base the allocation on the results of the primary. The candidate who receives the most delegate votes at their party's national convention will be the party’s nominee on the November general election ballot. That also means the top choice of Nevada Republican or Democratic voters may not be the nominee if more delegates from other states support a different candidate. Despite having a small fraction of delegates, Nevada holds more weight as a state that falls early in the nominating order, meaning that it draws greater attention from voters and candidates as the field takes shape. The Republican Party’s national convention will be held in July 2024, and the Democratic Party’s convention is set for August 2024. How will the presidential primaries be run? The presidential primaries will function just like other elections in Nevada. All voters registered as Democrats or Republicans will be mailed a ballot, unless they’veopted outof receiving a mail ballot. Local election officials must mail ballots to every registered voter eligible to participate in the primary by Jan. 17, 2024. In-person voting will take place during the early voting period (Jan. 27 to Feb. 2) and on Election Day (Feb. 6), and voters will be allowed to cast their ballots at any polling location in their county. Same-day registration services for new and existing voters (including a change in party affiliation) will be available during the early voting period and on Election Day. Mail ballots postmarked by Election Day will be counted as long as they are received by four days following the election, Feb. 10 at 5 p.m. Thedeadlinefor county commissions to canvass and certify the vote is Feb. 16. How will the GOP presidential caucus be run? The party-run nominating event will occur at 5 p.m. on Feb. 8 with Republican voters limited to participating in person. There will be no early or mail voting, though absentee ballots will be available strictly for “active duty military members and their dependents,”according to the party. Voters will be required to show a government-issued ID to participate, and voting will take place on paper ballots. Caucus-goers will also be able toview the tabulationof the ballots at each precinct location. How much does a presidential primary cost? During 2021 bill hearings, representatives with the secretary of state’s office estimated that hosting the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries wouldcost upward of $5.2 millionin each presidential election year. Those costs are driven primarily by mail ballots in each county, with additional expenses for extra personnel and voter outreach and education. The cost of each election will ultimately be influenced by the number of registered voters at the time of the election, and how many are mailed ballots. The Republican Party’s caucus will be run by the party and not cost money for the state. Why did Nevada adopt presidential primaries in place of caucuses? Nevada’s adoption of a presidential preference primary system came as state Democrats led apushto make the Silver State the first-in-the-nation primary state, ahead of New Hampshire. Following that change in law made during the 2021 legislative session, officials with the state partypitchedNevada as best suited for the first slot because of its diverse population, historical position as a swing state and recent policies to expand voting access — including same-day voter registration, two weeks of early voting before general elections and universal mail voting. Nevada has also served as a presidential bellwether, as a majority of Nevada voters have supported the winning presidential candidate in 26 of 28 elections dating back to 1912. The push also came with the support of former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who in 2020calledon states to switch to primaries for the Democratic presidential nominating process. Reid had previously helped move Nevada up the nominating calendar more than 15 years ago. At that time in 2008, Nevada and South Carolinamovedto third and fourth in the early state nominating order as Democrats aimed to add more diversity to the early voting calendar. Prior to then, Nevada’s caucuses — implemented in 1981 and held later in the year — carried less weight, as most presidential primary races were already decided by the time the state voted. Nevada has had a rockyhistoryof different types of presidential nominating elections and low voter turnout in such contests. Can the Nevada GOP have both a primary and a caucus? Yes, the party can hold its own caucus separate from the primary to award presidential delegates. It has happened multiple times throughout history, including inWashington in 2016, when Bernie Sanders won the state’s Democratic delegates after winning the Democratic caucus in March, before Hillary Clinton won a symbolic victory in May by defeating Sanders in the state’s Democratic primary. Can you caucus for someone or write in a candidate who has not filed for the caucus? No, the only candidates who will appear on the ballot are Trump and Binkley. They are also the only candidates eligible to receive delegates. Where is Nevada in the national nominating calendar? On the Democratic calendar, Nevada remains in third place behind South Carolina and New Hampshire, which remains first after resisting efforts led by the Democratic National Committee to place South Carolina first and Nevada tied in second with New Hampshire. On the RNC’s calendar, Nevada sits third, behind Iowa and New Hampshire. Does Nevada’s slot on the calendar matter? States that sit earlier in the nominating calendar typically hold greater weight in the process, serving as locales for presidential contenders to visit often, gain momentum and pick up delegates before the primary season hits full swing. Biden, after finishing fifth in the 2020 New Hampshire primary, came second in the Nevada caucus. One week later, hewent on to winresoundingly in the South Carolina primary — and eventually carried that momentum to the Democratic nomination and the presidency. Heading into 2024, most presidential contenders have placed little emphasis on Nevada, instead focusing on other early states, primarily Iowa and New Hampshire. Just three Republican presidential contenders —Trump,DeSantisandRamaswamy— have made more than one visit to Nevada. When are Nevada’s other elections in 2024? The 2024 primary election — which will include partisan primary races for seats in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives — will be Tuesday, June 11. The general election will be held Tuesday, Nov. 5. Both elections will have two weeks of early voting preceding Election Day, and mail ballots will be sent out by 20 days before Election Day.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-congressional-democrats-maintain-fundraising-advantages-as-2024-cycle-kicks-off,True,"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) and the state’s Democratic U.S. House members raised significantly more campaign cash than their opponents from April through June this year, continuing a trend of Democraticfundraising dominancefrom the 2022 midterm election cycle. Rosen headlined that group, as her campaign raised more than $2.7 million during the second quarter and recorded nearly $7.5 million in cash on hand — a record for a Nevada Senate race at this point in the cycle. The fundraising total is more than 24 times higher than her closest Republican opponent. Across the state’s four congressional districts, Reps. Susie Lee (D-NV) and Steven Horsford (D-NV) led the way in fundraising, bringing in nearly $583,000 and $668,000, respectively. With few prominent Republican challengers, those Democratic incumbents have built up significant cash advantages. Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) similarly outraised her Republican challengers, but reported significantly less cash on hand than Republican candidate Flemming Larsen, who has poured $650,000 of his own money into his campaign. Those totals come from campaign finance data for the second quarter reported through the Federal Election Commission. Continue reading for additional details on fundraising in each of the state’s 2024 congressional races. Even with fundraising advantages, Nevada’s congressional Democrats’ ability to spend will likely be dwarfed by outside groups and political action committees (PACs) as the 2024 general election, less than 16 months away, draws closer. Those groups are not subject to the same limits on contributions as individual candidates and often raise significantly more money. During the midterm elections, major national super PACsoutspentgeneral election candidates by about $75 million in Nevada, according to an analysis of data fromOpenSecrets, an independent nonprofit that tracks money in politics. Those groups included the Democratic House Majority PAC and Republican Congressional Leadership Fund, whichtargeted their resourcesat “toss-up” races for Nevada’s three Democrat-held congressional districts. After Nevada’s congressional Democrats had astrong showingin last year’s general election — holding onto a Senate seat and three House seats with help from newly drawn district maps that pulled more Democratic voters into competitive districts — those races are now considered less competitive. A pair of national election handicappers,Cook Political ReportandSabato’s Crystal Ball, rate the 2024 Nevada Senate race as “lean D” and those three House races as “likely D” or “lean D” — leftward shifts from the 2022 ratings of the same races. Despite that shift, national Democrats are still playing defense in those blue-leaning territories. The Democratic Congressional Campaign CommitteelistsLee and Horsford among its “frontline” members, who are considered critical to the group’s efforts to take the House majority. The National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, is targeting 37 seats in 2024, including those held by Lee, Horsford and Titus,Politicoreportedin March. After competitive 2022 races, those three Democratic incumbents each reported having less cash on hand at the end of June than they did at thesame pointin the 2022 cycle. With arecord$7.5 million in the bank at this point in the cycle, Rosen’s campaign was boosted last quarter by a combination of high-dollar contributions of more than $200 each (totaling nearly $1.4 million), small-dollar donations ($499,000), PAC contributions ($352,000) and support from other authorized fundraising committees ($468,000), which include groups such as the “Jacky Rosen Victory Fund” that raise funds outside the standard campaign committee. Her campaign spent nearly $1.3 million during the second quarter — a step up from the nearly $900,000 Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-NV) campaign spent during the same period last cycle. That spending largely came from travel and staff payroll, as Rosen has not kicked off campaign advertising in earnest at this point in the cycle. Among the Republican challengers to Rosen, former Assemblyman Jim Marchant led the field, with more than $111,000 raised and $43,000 in cash on hand. Marchant, a prominent election denier who lost a race for Congressional District 4 in 2020 and a race for secretary of state last year,announcedthe launch of his campaign in May, partway through the fundraising period. Marchant, who has closely aligned himself with former President Donald Trump and suggested in adebate last yearthat Nevadans’ votes have not “counted for decades,” received maximum contributions of $3,300 fromRobert Beadles, a prominent GOP donor from Washoe County, as well as Beadles’ wife, Nicole, and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne. Sam Brown, a former U.S. Army captain whoentered the racethis month with backing from institutional Republicans, did not launch his campaign until after the second quarter fundraising period closed. Two other Republican candidates in the race, real estate agent Stephanie Phillips and attorney Ronda Kennedy, reported significantly smaller fundraising hauls of $28,000 and $0, respectively. Lee outpaced her two Republican challengers during the second quarter by hundreds of thousands of dollars raised. As of the end of June, shehadnearly $811,000 in cash on hand and has raised more than $1.1 million this election cycle. In July of 2021, shehadnearly $955,000 in cash on hand. During the 2022 cycle, the District 3 race was one of the most expensive in the country, garnering about $25 million in outside spending,according to OpenSecrets. That spendingdrovemillions of dollars in television advertising during the final weeks leading up to Election Day. So far this cycle, Lee’s closest Republican challenger has raised about one-ninth as much money as Lee. Drew Johnson, a conservative columnist and former think tank founder who lost a close race for a seat on the Clark County Commission last year,raisednearly $121,000 from April to June, but most of that came from a $100,000 loan he made to his campaign. He now has more than $114,000 in cash on hand. Elizabeth Helgelien, another Republican challenger who served in the Nevada Senate from 2010 to 2012,raisedmore than $78,000 from April to June and spent more than $51,000, bringing her total cash on hand to more than $43,000. Helgelien’s fundraising included a $2,000 contribution from another Republican congressional challenger, David Flippo, who is running for District 4. Horsford similarly leads his race by a wide margin, with $757,000 incash on handafter he raised nearly $668,000 in the second quarter. At this time in 2021, he had more than $1.2 million in cash on hand. He only has one declared challenger so far: Flippo, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel who now works as a financial adviser in Las Vegas. Flippo has more than $88,000 in cash on hand. Flippo, who finished third in a Republican primary last year for a Nevada Assembly seat,raisedmore than $63,000 this reporting period and spent nearly $138,000. It’s a decrease from what he raised earlier this year. During the first quarter, Flipporaisednearly $221,000, more than $87,000 of which came from his own coffers. Titus outraised her challengers,bringing inmore than $183,000 from April to June. But with $367,000 in cash on hand, which is almost $100,000 less than the amount she had at the end of June 2021, Titus significantly trailed Flemming Larsen, a Republican challenger whose campaign has largely been supported with his own money. Larsen, a restaurateur who lost a bid for a Nevada Assembly district last year,madea $150,000 loan to his campaign in the second quarter, adding to a $500,000 loan he issued earlier this year. He raised more than $181,000 this reporting period, which includes the loan, and he has nearly $723,000 in cash on hand. He has raised nearly $117,000 in contributions from individuals this election cycle. Mark Robertson, a retired U.S. Army colonel who lost his bid to unseat Titus in 2022 by more than 5 percentage points,raisedmore than $25,000 during the second quarter and has nearly $116,000 cash on hand. Ronald Quince, another Republican challenger who has previously lost in two Republican primaries for state legislative races, did not report any fundraising activity in the second quarter. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), the state’s lone congressional Republican,raisedmore than $87,000 from April to June. He now has more than $306,000 in cash on hand after spending more than $42,000 during the second quarter. Amodei is so far running unopposed for re-election in Nevada’s second congressional district, a reliably Republican area.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sam-brown-on-his-repeat-run-for-u-s-senate-campaign-issues,True,"Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown, a retired U.S. Army captain who suffered severe burns in an explosion in Afghanistan, said in an interview Tuesday in Las Vegas that he is running for office again because he believes issues that previously motivated him to run, including high inflation, are worse than they were two years ago. “We need someone who understands our issues, who knows what it means to work, to have to live [on] a budget. That's what I bring,” he said. At a Monday rally inside a Sparks warehouse, Brownannouncedhis bid to challenge Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in 2024. Though he ran as an outsider two years ago, he’s entering this battleground race that could swing the balance of power in a narrowly divided U.S. Senate with the support of some institutional Republicans, including National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT). Despite support from national Republicans and two previous unsuccessful runs for office, Brown sought Tuesday to shed the label of politician. “I'm not really a politician. If I was to label myself, I would say, I'm a Christian. I'm a husband. I'm a father. I'm a veteran. I'm someone who has worked a blue-collar job. I'm someone who has built a business, and I'm someone who is here to help,” he said. “I'm here to take those experiences and to lead on behalf of Nevadans.” He also re-emphasized similar positions to his 2022 run, tying excessive government spending to inflation, arguing for smaller government through less taxes and fewer regulations and affirming that he is “pro life” — though he declined to say whether he would support or oppose a national abortion ban. Despite sizable grassrootsfundraisingand an active campaign, he lost in the Republican primary last year to former Attorney General Adam Laxalt by nearly 22 points, a margin of 56 percent to 34 percent. Laxalt was narrowly defeated by incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV). But even with greater institutional support than in his previous run, Brown faces an uphill battle in the 2024 Senate race. He’s challenging Rosen, who assumed office in 2019 after winning her race by 5 points in a“blue wave”year and who has$7.5 million in campaign cash on handas of the end of June — a state record at this point in a Senate campaign. Before that, he faces a Republican primary battle against Jim Marchant, a well-known figure among Nevada Republicans and a prominent election denier who previously served as a one-term assemblyman, as well against Las Vegas-based attorney Ronda Kennedy and real estate agent Stephanie Phillips. Jeffrey Ross Gunter, a former U.S. ambassador to Iceland appointed by former President Donald Trump, is alsomullinga Senate run. Brown did not comment on those candidates, including Marchant, saying he was “very focused on a campaign against” Rosen and that he considers anyone else entering the race as “an indictment against” the incumbent Democrat. Brown, prior to moving to Nevada in 2018, previously mounted an unsuccessful run for a seat in the Texas Legislature in 2014. A veteran who suffered severe burns in an explosion during battle in Afghanistan, Brown has also run a small business providing  “emergency pharmaceutical support” to veterans, according to his campaignwebsite. In a roughly 10-minute interview, Brown spoke withThe Nevada IndependentTuesday to discuss his campaign and where he stands on several issues. Additional information has been included based on Brown’s positions during his Senate campaign last year — as of Tuesday, his 2024 campaignwebsitedid not include information about his stances on campaign issues. The economy and spending Brown reiterated a key issue from his 2022 campaign, saying he was concerned about Nevadans “suffering under inflation” through higher costs for gas, electricity and groceries that “impact people at the kitchen table.” He tied continued inflation to excessive government spending, saying there should be more accountability for spending decisions in Washington, D.C. and that the federal government should act like households that have to balance their budget. He also generally called for less taxes and fewer regulations. “I would love to see a cut across the board, and our departments and agencies find ways to do the same or do more with less. I think it's possible,” Brown said. “Constantly, people are having to figure out how to do the same or more with less, and D.C. should be held to that same standard.” When asked during adebatein last year’s Senate race how he would reduce government spending, Brown proposed eliminating federal agencies that also exist on the state level, suggesting the country could live without departments of energy, transportation and education. Abortion Brown said during his 2022 campaign that he was “pro life,” though he generally said little publicly on the issue of abortion last year. On his 2022 campaignwebsite, he said he would “oppose any federal funding of abortion and only support U.S. Supreme Court Justices who understand the importance of protecting life.” On Tuesday, he said again that he was “pro life,” but he declined to say whether he would support or oppose a national abortion ban, adding that he was “not going to deliberate on hypothetical legislation.” He noted that he supported exceptions in cases of rape, incest and a threat to the life of a mother, but said broadly his goal was to reduce the number of abortions, including through ensuring easier paths to adoption and providing better prenatal and postnatal care. When asked if he’d support an effort to change Nevada’sabortion law— which protects access up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and can only be overturned by a majority of voters — Brown said, “That's a hypothetical situation that we're not dealing with today.” “The fact of the matter is I don't see Nevada's laws changing,” Brown said. Polls consistentlyshowthat a majority of Nevadans support protecting abortion access. Brown, meanwhile, criticized Rosen’s position on abortion as extreme, including taking issue with hersupportfor the Women’s Health Protection Act — legislationaimedat enshrining into law the struck-down protections fromRoe v. Wade. Elections Asked if he believed the state’s elections are secure, Brown said he feels “pretty confident in our elections,” but said there is an issue with too many Nevadans not having faith in the process. He did not specify steps to improving that faith, but on his 2022 campaignwebsite, said he would prioritize “passing election integrity legislation … including the requirement that every voter must produce identification to vote.” AFebruary pollfromThe Nevada Independentand Noble Predictive Insights found that a large majority of Nevada voters support requiring identification to vote. In 2021, Brown said in aninterview with KRNVin Reno that “Joe Biden is our president. That is a political process and he was confirmed by the Electoral College."" During the primary debate against Laxalt inMay 2022, Brown — who backed Trump and volunteered for his 2020 campaign — sharply criticized Laxalt for doing too little to bolster the Trump campaign’s legal challenge to the 2020 presidential election results in Nevada. That included saying at the time that “the only thing [Laxalt] did was to file a lawsuit that, by [his] own admission, was late.” Laxalt, who received backing from national Republicans and Trump in the 2022 Senate race, served as the Trump campaign’s Nevada co-chair in 2020. While the Trump campaign and Trump himself repeatedly reiterated false claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent and stolen, Nevada election officials have foundno evidenceof widespread fraud affecting the outcome of the election. Despite Brown’s efforts to press Laxalt on challenging the 2020 election, he has often avoided sharing his own thoughts about the election. He said Tuesday that “we don't need to relitigate something from three years ago.” Trump Though he has expressed support for Trump over the years, including volunteering for the Trump campaign in 2020, Brown on Monday declined to endorse Trump’s 2024 campaign in an increasingly crowded field of Republican presidential contenders — already marking a difference with Marchant, who recentlyendorsedTrump for president. Brown told reporters at his campaign launch event that he was focused on his own race and that Republicans need to put forward a candidate capable of defeating President Joe Biden. Second Amendment Brown believes the “Constitution unequivocally guarantees our right to bear arms” under the Second Amendment, according to his 2022 campaignwebsite. He has taken a firm stanceagainst“red flag” laws, which allow a court to order the temporary removal of a person’s firearms if that person is believed to present a danger to themselves or others. Last year, one of Brown’s most intense criticisms of Laxalt came in the form of undermining the former attorney general’s positionon red flag laws. Though Laxalt and his PAC later opposed a 2019 push to create a red flag law and criticized such laws during a 2017 speech before the National Rifle Association (NRA) — it was also Laxalt’s office that, in 2018,drafted a memobacking the study and potential implementation of red flag laws in the first place. At the time, Brown said in a statement that “I would never recommend giving a predominantly liberal judiciary nearly unfettered discretion” to restrict access to guns under the Second Amendment. Big Tech On the campaign trail last year, Brown was heavily critical of Big Tech companies, arguing on his campaign website that they “routinely abuse their power through privacy invasions and the manipulation of public discourse through online censorship and suppression,” particularly of conservative voices. Brown dealt with his own Twitter account beingsuspendedbriefly in 2021. Though the company tied the suspension to a technical error, Brown’s campaignsaidat the time the company was “unfairly targeting the Republican U.S. Senate candidate.” In last year’s debate against Laxalt, Brown addressed Section 230 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 — the federal law that limits legal liability for tech giants by allowing social media companies to operate as platforms, rather than as traditional publications — saying that major tech companies should be held to the same standards as publications when they choose to moderate speech. On Tuesday, he said he remained concerned about online censorship, but did not take a position onantitrust legislation, which has generally aimed to prevent the dominance of Big Tech companies. He described that as getting into a realm of “hypothetical ideas.” Reporter Jacob Solis contributed to this story.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-denies-nv-gop-request-to-block-presidential-primary-election,True,"A Carson City judge has denied a motion by the Nevada Republican Party to block the state from holding a presidential primary election next year in favor of a caucus. Judge James Russell issued the ruling from the bench Monday, denying thestate party’s lawsuitfiled in May challenging a 2021 law moving the state away from a presidential caucus to a primary election. The lawsuitarguedthat the 2021 law would prevent the party from holding a caucus, but attorneys representing the statesaid the NV GOPcould still choose to hold a caucus to determine how to allocate presidential delegates if it chose to do so. Nevada Republican Party Chair Michael McDonald said in an interview Monday that the party was weighing legal options after the ruling, but had anticipated the outcome and was “prepared for a long fight.” He said the party was working with Democratic Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar’s office (whom he described as “phenomenal to work with”) to reach a workable solution. McDonald added that the party still intends to hold a caucus in February to allocate the state’s presidential delegates, and is now seeking to avert a state-run primary election to avoid confusing voters and prevent a “huge waste of taxpayer money.” “It’s not going to matter, and it won’t be counted,” he said. While primaries are run by governments and use secret ballots, caucuses are run by political parties, require in-person participation, and involve publicly indicating one’s preferred candidate. In 2021, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolaksigned lawstransitioning Nevada from a caucus to a presidential primary, and moving the date for it to be held to the first Tuesday in February, advancing the state in the presidential nominating calendar.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/army-veteran-sam-brown-enters-u-s-senate-race,True,"Retired U.S. Army Capt. Sam Brown is entering Nevada's 2024 U.S. Senate race, with the institutional backing of Senate Republicans. Brown, who made his announcement public at a Monday afternoon event at Bragg Crane Service in Sparks, pitched himself in a statement toThe Nevada Independentas the best candidate to take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), who is running for a second term. Best known as an Army veteran who sustained severe injuries during a 2008 deployment in Afghanistan, Brown has never held office before but garnered attention for strong fundraising during an unsuccessful Nevada Republican Senate primary bid last cycle. “Right now, the American Dream is at risk,” Brown said. “Joe Biden and Jacky Rosen promised to unite Americans and solve problems. Instead, they’ve abandoned Nevada and divided America with extreme policies to satisfy special interests in Washington.” In a warehouse on the Bragg property, which was decorated with American flags and had its garage doors open to a backdrop of blue sky and mountains, Brown’s wife, U.S. Army Captain Amy Brown, took the stage first. She focused on Brown as a father to their three children, mentioning that he could give D.C. politicians the same basic economics lessons he gave their children — ages 14, 11 and 8 — in the family living room. Brown, welcomed to the stage by an increasingly loud chant of “Sam, Sam, Sam,” said he would prioritize Nevadans over “D.C. bureaucrats,” as he accused Rosen of doing. A common refrain, though not yet an official campaign slogan, was “Nevada values over D.C. values.” Brown, who moved to Nevada with his family in 2018, is originally from Arkansas, but had lived in Texas since 2008. After graduating from West Point, Brown was deployed to Kandahar, where he suffered severe burns in an explosion. He underwent several years of physical therapy to recover from his wounds, earning the Purple Heart and Bronze Star medals in the process. Brown took a ‘country over party’ tack in his statement, emphasizing his military history and framing his candidacy with an eye towards the general election. “I know our mission to restore the American Dream is achievable if we work together,” Brown continued. “In the military, no one asks you what party you are in. They just want to know they can count on you to get the job done….As your Senator, I will get the job done for Nevada.” His entry into the race was immediately praised by National Republican Senatorial Committee chair Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), who said he was “very pleased that Sam is stepping up to run for the U.S. Senate.” Political history In his previous run, Brown lost in the primary to former attorney general Adam Laxalt by more than 20 percentage points. Despite the lopsided total, national Republicans took note of his fundraising capacity — Brown raised more than $4 million — in a contest against a Republican who had high name recognition given that Laxalt had the benefit of a state-famous last name, had already run two statewide campaigns, and was endorsed by former President Donald Trump. On his PAC's website, Brown said more than 42,000 people donated to his 2022 campaign. Politically, Brown’s 2022 positions reflected the Republican base, both fiscally and socially. He blamed inflation on government spending, which he said he wanted to cut by eliminating several federal agencies. And he is against gun control laws, abortion and the teaching of so-called “critical race theory” in schools, a common conservative belief that schools’ teaching about diversity, inclusion and the country’s racial history has become divisive. Brown’s campaign launch speech touched on those priorities, but mainly focused on criticisms of Rosen and other Democrats. Brown argued that Nevada’slow national rankingson education were caused by Rosen being “for the teachers’ unions and bureaucrats … dictating to us how things ought to be.” “Those are her stakeholders,” Brown said. “I stand here before you today to say that we have to reorient our stakeholders. Our stakeholders ought to be the parents in our communities.” He added that restoring citizens’ trust in elections was imperative. “I'll tell you where there is not a restoration of trust and faith is in Jacky Rosen and her leadership,” he said. “She has failed us time and time again.” Speaking to the press after his speech, Brown also attributed the war in Ukraine to the leadership of Democrats such as Biden and Rosen. Laxalt, who shares many of Brown’s policy positions, lost to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) by less than a point last year. Brown will once again face a candidate with Trump ties in the primary — former state assemblyman and election denierJim Marchant, who was part of a slate of secretary of state candidates Trump backed in 2022. Marchant has alreadyendorsedTrump for president this cycle. Brown declined to endorse a Republican presidential candidate, telling reporters at his launch event that he was focused on his own race and trusted that Republicans would put forward a candidate capable of defeating Joe Biden. In the years after his deployment and recovery, Brown lived in Texas, where he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the state legislature in 2014. He started a small business providing emergency medicine as an intermediary between veterans’ hospitals and private companies. He and his family moved to Reno in 2018, and sold his business last year. In the time between campaigns, Brown launched Duty First PAC, which donated to Nevada Republican congressional candidates in the 2022 cycle, and occasionally tweeted out commentary oneconomic policyorcongressional happenings. State of the primary While Brown often challenged Laxalt from the right in 2022, including accusing the former attorney general ofnot prosecuting voter fraud, his path to the 2024 nomination would go through Marchant, a fervent election denier who has remainedloyalto the embattled former president, evenappearingat Trump’s New Jersey golf club to hear from him the day after his federal arraignment. While Brown has the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee — Daines recruited him to run — Marchant may have some local party support. The Republican Party chairs of Clark and Washoe counties spoke at Marchant’s launch event. After a disastrous 2022 campaign — in which Republicans lost a seat in Pennsylvania and squandered pickup opportunities in Arizona, Georgia, New Hampshire and, of course, Nevada, Daines is determined to avoid the “candidate quality” issues that Republicans believe plagued them in the midterms. The NRSC is hoping Brown can maintain a strong enough conservative base of support to win the primary while being appealing enough to independents to take the general election. Republicans don’t need to flip Nevada to win control of the Senate in 2024, with the balance hanging on just two seats, but it could be a critical part of the equation and represents a major opportunity, given the tight margin of Cortez Masto’s race in 2022. The Cook Political Report gives Rosen the edge, rating the race as “Lean D.” Daines is also hoping to pick off Democrat-held seats in West Virginia, Ohio, and Arizona. Nevada Democrats, meanwhile, see Brown’s entry into the race as an opportunity for Republicans to wound their chances duking it out amongst themselves for the next year. “With the entrance of Mitch McConnell’s handpicked candidate Sam Brown, Republicans are in for a brutal and messy primary that will expose their deeply flawed candidates as out of touch with hardworking Nevadans,” state party spokesperson Johanna Warshaw said in a statement. The Senate primary will be held June 11. Jeremy Hughes, a Republican strategist in the state, said before Brown’s launch that there are other potential candidates who will be looking at Brown’s first quarterly fundraising report to see whether it will be viable enough to mount a serious bid. But the backing of the NRSC will give him a leg up in fundraising. “If Sam has a great launch and great first quarter and really puts it together, then they set themselves well on the way to winning the primary and being competitive in the general,” Hughes said. The Brown campaign just needs to capitalize on that opportunity with strong successive quarters to close out the year, he added, especially because Rosen has proven herself to be a capable fundraiser. Rosen has a record$7.5 million on handgoing into the second half of the year. Challenges from Marchant or former ambassador to IcelandJeffrey Ross Gunterwill also depend on fundraising. Brown may also have to overcome Democratic meddling to boost Marchant, if Democrats use the samestrategy they did nationwide in 2022to help get the most extreme Republicans through primaries in order to best capture independents and win general elections. “The biggest contributors to Marchant’s campaign will be the Democrats when they try to promote him in April and May of next year,” Hughes said. “That's clearly what they're going to do. Anybody who looks at it and doesn't think that is very Pollyanna-ish. So, that's why it's really on Sam to go out and win the race.” Updated at 6:15 p.m. on 7/10/23 to add details from announcement event.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-has-record-7-5-million-on-hand-after-second-quarter-of-2023,True,"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) raised $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2023, leaving her with $7.5 million in cash on hand going into the second half of the year — a state record for money in the bank at this point, according to her campaign. Rosen’s campaign said the haul includes donations from over 12,000 new donors, and that she received money from all 17 counties in the state. The full list of donors and fundraising breakdown will be in her quarterly filing report, due July 15. This was Rosen’s best fundraising quarter of the cycle, besting her$2.4 million haulin the first quarter and$1.5 millionin the final quarter of 2022. For Rosen, whodeclared her candidacyin early April, it was her first quarter fundraising the entire time as a declared candidate. Rosen’s fundraising quarter closely mirrors whereSen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) sat at this point in 2021— Cortez Masto had raised $2.8 million in the second quarter of the pre-election year and had $6.6 million on hand. Cortez Masto ended up setting numerous Nevadafundraising recordsthroughout her 2022 campaign. Rosen’s massive war chest will give her an advantage over her eventual Republican challenger, who will have to spend money early to win the primary. So far, neither Jim Marchant, who declared a run for Senate in early May, or Stephanie Phillips, who declared in April, have yet to announce fundraising totals. Potential challenger Sam Brown’s Duty First PAC ended 2022 with about $5,500 in cash on hand, and more than $270,000 in debts and loans owed. ""While Republicans fight each other in what’s gearing up to be a messy, expensive, and increasingly crowded primary, Senator Rosen is raising the resources needed to communicate with voters across the state about her work as one of the most bipartisan Senators getting things done and delivering for Nevada,” Lexie Leventis, Rosen’s finance director, said in a statement. Rosen’s seat is expected to be a battleground for control of the Senate. Nevada is a potential pickup opportunity for Republicans, who only need to flip two seats to gain control of the chamber, and a necessity for Democrats to defend if they want to hold the Senate.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-blasts-desantis-repeats-false-election-claims-in-first-las-vegas-visit-of-2024-campaign,True,"Former President Donald Trump spoke to a crowd of loyalists and volunteers Saturday afternoon in Las Vegas, marking his first visit to Nevada since launching his 2024 presidential bid. Trump, who addressed a crowd of over 500 people at Fervent: A Calvary Chapel Church with another 400 people standing outside the venue, took shots at his top primary opponent — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — and President Joe Biden, attacking the former for being a political opportunist and the latter for being corrupt. He used the speech to repeat severaldisproven claimsabout the 2020 election. Trump also lobbed a Nevada-specific attack on DeSantis’ support as a member of Congress for funding Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste storage facility. Trump himself supported the use of Yucca in his energy budgets before hereversed coursein 2020. But despite pronouncing “Yucca” wrong, he drew a clear distinction between himself and DeSantis on the issue. “If you don’t mind nuclear waste dumped in your backyard, I suggest you vote for Ron DeSanctimonious,” he said. Trump is now the second major Republican presidential candidate to hold a campaign event in Nevada; DeSantis became the first at the JuneBasque Fryin Gardnerville. Nevada has been friendly territory for the former president, who dominated the 2016 Republican presidential caucus en route to locking up the nomination and has retained the loyalty of the state party apparatus. That includes Chairman Michael McDonald, whom Trump shouted out numerous times throughout the speech, saying he diverted his travel schedule to “come and say hello to Michael.” He name-dropped other Nevada GOP figures, including Clark County Republican Party Chair Jesse Law (who he said would be a “big factor” in the campaign’s plans) Republican National Committeewoman Sigal Chattah, saying she would be helping him litigate the 2024 election, and national Committeeman Jim DeGraffenreid, despite mispronouncing his last name. Several of those state party leaders were involved in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. McDonald and DeGraffenreid were interviewed by the congressional January 6 Committee over their roles in the “fake elector” scheme to submit uncertified electoral votes for Trump, and have appeared in federal court this year as part of a Justice Department investigation. McDonald had hisphone seizedby the FBI last year. Still, Trump’s public praise of their efforts and discussions of their future roles in the campaign signaled a continued cozy relationship with just months remaining until the state’s February presidential contest. Trump is besieged with his own legal woes, including a federal indictment related to hismishandling of classified documentsand an indictment by the state of New York for violating campaign finance law through hush money payments. Another federal indictment could be coming over hisattempts to overturn the 2020 electionas couldcriminal indictmentsover a state-level investigation into election interference in Georgia. But among his supporters in Las Vegas on Saturday, he brought up the indictments sparingly, instead focusing mainly on unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, the border and energy. Trump began his speech noting that he received over 150,000 more votes in the 2020 election than he did in 2016. “We have a big job to do,” Trump said. “This has been a hard state. I really believe it’s a Republican state. “They can be dishonest, and they can lie, they can cheat, they can do whatever they want,” he continued, laying out his 2024 strategy with repeated false claims of electoral fraud “The one thing they can’t do is, if we get massive numbers of votes — they can only go so far.” Nevada has voted for the Democratic nominee in every presidential election since 2004, albeit by close margins. Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), in a Saturday morning pre-retort to Trump, noted that electoral history. “We’re a swing state, but I don’t think Nevada’s going to go for that outrageous policy agenda again, because they didn’t do it twice before,” she said. Trump was far more bullish, saying he would win the election “in numbers the likes of which nobody has seen before.” He continually noted throughout the speech that the Las Vegas crowd size was limited to volunteers as an explanation for the sparse attendance compared to his rallies in other states. More than 400 supporters were not able to enter the event because of occupancy limits, a fire department official said. On Saturday morning,The Messengerreportedhis campaign made its first staffing move in the state: state GOP executive director Alida Benson will serve as Nevada’s campaign director. Benson was the Nevada data director during Trump’s 2020 run. Trump described the upcoming presidential election as the most consequential one in the history of the nation. “I believe it’s truly the last chance,” he said. “And I think that if we don’t do it, our country is doomed to a tremendous and horrible failure … I am the only one that can save this nation.” Policy agenda Trump pledged to implement universal voter ID laws, same-day voting and paper ballots — something the vast majority of Americansalready do, either via mail or at polling places, where they are typically marked by hand and processed by machine. He railed against vote-by-mail and the length of time the 2020 election took to be called. Nevadaexpandedvote-by-mail ahead of the 2020 election due to the pandemic, and it tookfour daysto call the election. Trump also repeatedly discussed the border with Mexico, saying it had become a nonissue under his watch but would be a major factor in 2024. “They actually really want open borders,” Trump said of Biden and other Democrats. “Either they’re stupid — which they’re not, because you can’t be stupid and cheat on elections like they cheat — or they hate our country. And they have to hate our country.” On energy, Trump pledged to open the U.S. up to further oil drilling, specifically in Alaska, which he said would generate enormous revenue and help ease inflation. He also joked about Democrats’ embrace of electric vehicles, which he said only run for an hour at a time, drawing some laughs from the crowd. (Theaverage rangefor an electric vehicle in 2020 was 260 miles). He noted the rise in real median household income in Nevada during his presidency, saying it rose nearly $11,000 before falling under Biden amid inflation. He correctly noted that figure (from theFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis), represented a high point in the state’s history, but did not note its fall by the time he was leaving office in 2020 to a level nearly equal to when he was inaugurated. Economically, he said he would reduce taxes beyond hissignature 2017 tax cuts. And near the end of his speech, his focus shifted to transgender rights, telling long stories — with specific times and weights but no other details — about transgender women “obliterating” records in swimming and weightlifting. But his most consistent focus — and the cause of the biggest cheers from the crowd — remained election fraud. “If we stop the cheating, we are going to win,” he said. Opponents Trump had plenty of criticism for Biden, calling him corrupt, incompetent andfalsely claiminghe took millions of dollars in foreign funds from China and Ukraine. But he saved his most personal — and Nevada-specific — fire for DeSantis. Trump attacked DeSantis, his top competitor in the Republican primary, during an extended series of anecdotes and throughout the more policy focused parts of the speech. In his Nevada appearance last month, DeSantis did not mention Trump by name, but warned Republicans that they’ve “developed a culture of losing in this party.” Trump was more direct. Recalling how DeSantis asked for his political support during his 2018 run for Florida governor, a story Trump has told many times, claiming DeSantis’ political career was dead on arrival before his endorsement, Trump described his anger at realizing DeSantis — or “DeSanctimonious,” as he called him — would be his primary opponent. “I said, listen Ron, you’re so dead that if Abraham Lincoln and George Washington came back from the dead, and if they put their hands and hearts together and prayed for [you]…nothing is going to change,” Trump said, of DeSantis’ 2018 Republican primary. “Ron, you are gone.” Polling in Nevadahas consistently found Trump maintaining 30-point leads over DeSantis. ANevada Independent/ Noble Predictive Insights poll conducted inlate Aprilfound Biden with an 8-point lead over Trump and a 1-point lead over DeSantis in the state. A Julypollfrom a pro-DeSantis group found Biden beating Trump by a narrower 3-point margin, and down a point to DeSantis. Crowd reaction Trump has a nearly decade-long history of rallies and events across the state —his first rally in October 2015 atTreasure Island in Las Vegas(when he memorably tweeted, “Many Hispanics who love me and I love them!”), stumping for Republican midterm candidates inElko, appearing at thestate party’s Las Vegas convention in 2018and holdingin-person ralliesin Minden and Henderson during the pandemic in 2020. He madeseveralvisitsin2022to boost Adam Laxalt during his run for Senate and to support Gov. Joe Lombardo’s campaign. Attendees on Saturday described Trump as the only candidate who could save the country from ruin. They described Biden as a corrupt and incompetent president who is too old to be running, but also one who was capable of using whatever means necessary to plunge the country into chaos. In interviews withThe Nevada Independent,more than 10 attendees echoed Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, dismissed the two indictments against him as an abuse of government power and said Trump was the only Republican presidential candidate who has always stayed true to his word. TN Trump, a 57-year-old Californian who said he legally changed his last name to Trump as a show of support, said Trump is “the only president that dares to speak the truth.” “For people that have a misunderstanding about what kind of person President Trump is, for the last many years, and they have not changed their mind yet, I have no idea what happened to their brain,” he said. “America has been under fire. They are burning down this country.” It was the first time seeing Trump for some supporters, including Jackie Morales, a 63-year-old retiree who spent about $700 to come to Saturday’s event from Utah. Other attendees had attended more than 10 Trump events. Supporters wore hats that said “Trump won” and “God is our savior. Trump is our president.” Volunteers also set up tables with information about the Republican caucuses next February and how to become a poll worker. Val Simon, 81, said she thinks Trump is “down to earth” and “appreciates everyone” around him. Stephanie Kinsley, a 41-year-old property manager, was wearing a shirt that said “Men can’t be moms,” part of the broader anti-transgender rhetoric that has become popular in the GOP. She also brought a cutout of Trump’s head emblazoned with “Save our kids.” “Men have autogynephilia and are turned on by dressing as a woman, want to be a woman,” she said. “They want to kill us and throwing on a bra and some lipstick makes you a woman? It’s disgusting.” Gender dysphoria, which is the discomfort that arises when someone’s gender identity differs from their biological sex, is recognized by leading medical organizations. Transgender individuals havehigherrates of depression and suicide ideation than cisgender people, and medical groups havebackedgender-affirming care to treat people with gender dysphoria. Above all on Saturday, attendees catastrophized about what a Trump-less future in America would look like. “If Trump does not win, game over,” said Patrick Quan, a 68-year-old retiree.",Error: Connection error.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/7-months-before-primaries-boulder-citys-july-4th-event-sees-less-politicking-than-usual,True,"Boulder City’s annual Fourth of July “Damboree” on Tuesday had its usual share of parade participation and pancake preparation — but the political persuasion at the event wasn’t as palpable as in past years. No presidential candidates attended the event, and U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) was the only statewide elected official in attendance. Other candidates who walked the parade route included Stephanie Phillips, a Las Vegas Republican who is challenging Rosen, and three Republicans hoping to unseat U.S. Rep. Dina Titus to represent Nevada’s 1st Congressional District, where Boulder City is located: businessman Ron Quince, restaurateur Flemming Larsen and veteran Mark Robertson, wholostto Titus last year by 5.6 percentage points. Titus supporters also marched in the parade. The lack of political jockeying from statewide and national candidates is a far cry from recent years.Four years ago— the last time a presidential election was 16 months away — U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) and U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Massachusetts) took part in the Damboree while running for president. Supporters of then-candidates Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders also attended the event. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford and Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar walked down the parade route last year. “Our system is about democracy and knowing people, so I think it's a great place [for candidates],” said Alan Goya, 68, a longtime Boulder City resident who rode on a float with his wife, Clark County Clerk Lynn Goya. Presidential candidates have for the most part stayed away from Nevada this election cycle, despite the Silver State tied for second in the Democratic primary calendar and third in the GOP schedule. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is the only declared candidate to visit the state so far, attending theBasque Fryin Northern Nevada last month. By Independence Dayin 2015, presidential candidates had held more than 21 events in Nevada, though none participated in the Damboree. Nevadans flocked to the Damboree on Tuesday, which is named for the nearby Hoover Dam. Following a two-hour breakfast, hosted by the Rotary Club of Boulder City, which served pancakes, sausage and juice, more than 75 groups paraded down streets near Boulder City’s grassy Bicentennial Park. Some local political groups, including Boulder City Republican Women and the Clark County Republican Party, rode along the parade route. Other politicians at the event included Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-Las Vegas) and Assemblywoman Danielle Gallant (R-Las Vegas). Phillips, the GOP challenger for Rosen’s seat, toldThe Nevada Independentthat the Damboree was an opportunity to meet voters. She said she was motivated to run after the pandemic shut down the economy and officials imposed vaccine mandates. She also decried government spending and “what they’re doing to the kids,” a reference to right-wing backlash over transgender rights and discussions about gender in schools. Rosen, meanwhile, is running on her record in her first term as senator. In an interview, she spoke about “taking care of Nevada families,” such as by helping cap monthly insulin prices at $35 for Medicare beneficiaries as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. “It's a happy day to come out to be part of the parade, to eat pancakes, just to relax with your family,” Rosen said of the Damboree, which celebrated its 75th anniversary this year. Attendees said the Damboree is not an inherently political event — it’s instead a chance for people, including politicians, to come together — but politics seemed to be on some people’s minds. Parade watchers wore shirts with phrases including “MAGA” — a nod to former president Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan — and Let’s Go Brandon, a slogan that Republicans have adopted to rally against President Joe Biden. Social issues were also evident, as one woman wore a shirt that said “Make America Unoffendable Again.” Boulder City has a Republican mayor, Joe Hardy, who has served as a state senator and assemblyman. Stuart Ripplinger was wearing a shirt supporting DeSantis for president. He described Trump as a “petulant child” who could not beat Biden. He also chastised Rosen but appreciated that politicians from both parties could come to the Damboree. “For people to be able to come here on the Democratic side, who are obviously in this town are not in the majority, to feel comfortable and we can all just interact here without any animosity or acrimony is a good thing,” the 40-year-old business owner said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-teachers-union-vows-to-fight-public-funding-for-as-vegas-stadium,True,"The Nevada State Education Association (NSEA) launched a campaign Thursday to stop public funding for the construction of a new baseball stadium for the Oakland A’s in Las Vegas, with the statewide teachers union vowing to pursue “every possible path” to stop the use of public financing, including litigation or even a referendum effort. The campaign comes in the form of a new political action committee (PAC) — Schools Over Stadiums — that the unionregisteredon Wednesday with the secretary of state’s office. Representatives of the union said that the campaign and PAC are responding to a “giveaway of hundreds of millions in tax dollars to a California billionaire for a stadium” at a time when Nevada schools are ranked as among theworst in the country. “Nevada's priorities are misguided, and public funds should not go to a California billionaire for a stadium,"" NSEA President Dawn Etcheverry said in the release. After the end of the 2023 legislative session, Gov. Joe Lombardoconveneda special session in early June to pass a bill financing the construction of a stadium for the Oakland A’s Major League Baseball team. After muchdiscussionand severalamendments, lawmakerspassedthe bill that committed up to $380 million in public financing through a combination of tax credits and county-issued bonds to help fund the project. The proposed $1.5 billion, 30,000-seat baseball stadium is set to be built on the south end of the Strip on 9 acres of a 35-acre parcel that houses the Tropicana Hotel Casino. The special session took place after lawmakers failed to pass a stadium funding bill in the regular 120-day session on account of abudget standoffbetween the governor and Democratic lawmakers. In the Thursday press release, NSEA members criticized the decision to call a special session over public financing for the stadium when legislators failed to take significant action to reduce class sizes or generate new revenue for schools and educators. “Instead of hiring part-time stadium workers, let’s ensure each student has a qualified and full-time educator in the classroom,” said Vicki Kreidel, president of NSEA affiliate group NEA of Southern Nevada. To get an initiative or referendum on the ballot that proposes or repeals language for state law, a petitioner must obtain signatures from at least 10 percent of the voters in the previous general election — meaning that at least 102,586 signatures are needed to get an initiative or referendum on the 2024 ballot. At least 25,647 signatures would need to come from each of the state’s four congressional districts. Petitioners would need to file with the secretary of state no earlier than Aug. 1, then within 10 business days, the secretary of state would post a copy of the petition, and petitioners could begin collecting signatures. The petitioners must collect and submit signatures by July 8, 2024. If a petition receives enough signatures and a simple majority of Nevadans vote in favor of the corresponding ballot question, it would pass and change state law. The NSEA is the state affiliate of the National Education Association that represents educators throughout the state. Though the NSEA is pushing for the initiative, a separate union that isthe recognized bargaining unitfor educators within the Clark County School District, the Clark County Education Association (CCEA), is not participating. “We’re not involved, and we wouldn’t follow the lead of an irrelevant organization,” CCEA Executive Director John Vellardita said, adding that Democrats passed the bill, a Republican governor signed it, and the stadium seems like a settled matter. Vince Saavedra, executive secretary-treasurer of the Southern Nevada Building Trades Unions, expressed worries about the effect overturning the bill could have on job opportunities. “While we understand the importance of education funding, it is crucial to recognize that opposing the Athletics' move to Las Vegas and the construction of a ballpark will not directly translate into increased pay for teachers, but it will translate to lost jobs for our hardworking families,” Saavedra wrote in a text message toThe Nevada Independent. A spokesman for Bally’s Corp., which operates the Tropicana and is giving the team the land for the stadium, declined to comment on the PAC or potential referendum. A spokesperson for the A’s said the team was aware of the PAC filing and the NSEA’s opposition testimony to SB1, but declined further comment. In an interview Thursday, MGM Resorts International CEO Bill Hornbuckle said he was aware of the potential referendum but the casino giant,which has five resortswith more than 13,000 hotel rooms directly across from the Tropicana, was still supportive of building the stadium. “It’s our clear view that this is in the public's best interest [and] it’s in the community's best interest,” Hornbuckle said. “[The stadium] would drive tourism. I think we've now proven it with T-Mobile Arena and it's been proven with Allegiant Stadium beyond anyone's expectation. I think [the stadium] is additive in that context.” Hornbuckle said the company “was not a fan” if hotel room taxes were used to fund the baseball stadium, even though MGM Resorts was one of the primary proponents of the $750 million in room tax revenue used to build the $1.9 billion Allegiant Stadium. The $380 million tax package for the baseball stadium does not require hotel room taxes and MGM took a much larger interest in the development once it was locked into the Tropicana site. “We think it’s accretive for us given its location. I’d be hard pressed to say otherwise,” Hornbuckle said. “But we also think it’s accretive for the community. It’s going to bring close to a half million tourists here focused on the summer months.” The effort to stop the public financing package echoes a failedballot initiativethe NSEA pushed in 2014 that sought to implement a 2 percent margin tax on Nevada businesses making more than $1 million in annual revenue a year in an effort to fund schools.

Though the NSEAspent more than $1.6 million dollars on the campaign, a coalition to defeat the margin tax funded by the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce, the Nevada Mining Association and businesses such as the Las Vegas Sandsspent more than $4.9 millionon the effort to kill it.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-democrats-keep-abortion-top-of-mind-one-year-after-roe-overturned,True,"On the day the Supreme Court overturned nearly 50 years of precedent and decided Americans have no constitutional right to an abortion, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) was in Washington, D.C. She spent the morning of June 24, 2022, texting with her mother and sister. She joined Senate Democrats in walking to the court and protesting the decision. And with just months to go until Election Day, she made abortion access a centerpiece of her 2022 re-election campaign. “It’s one of the reasons why I’m back here,” Cortez Masto said in a recent interview. “It’s just such an important issue to Nevadans.” Nevada’s elected Democrats, state strategists and pro-abortion advocates say theDobbsdecision unleashed an enormous wave of political anger and activism, powering Democrats to victory in 2022 and becoming a pillar of the party’s 2024 playbook — even as access to abortionremained protected in Nevada law. In the year since, all five of Nevada’s congressional Democrats have joined on to legislation codifying various reproductive rights and been active in promoting their stanceson televisionandonline. Meanwhile, Democrats in the Legislatureadvanced a ballot measureto codify the right to an abortion in the state’s constitution, and also advanced a bill protecting out-of-state abortion seekers and those providing reproductive care from prosecution in Nevada that was signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. To commemorate the anniversary of theDobbsdecision, Senate Democrats introduced four pieces of legislation to protect various reproductive rights, including the right to birth control, private digital health data and travel to other states to seek abortions. That latter proposal comes as states have passed policies focused on limiting out-of-state abortion access. Idaho passed a lawcriminalizinghelping a minor travel to receive an abortion in another state, while state legislators inMissourihave proposed permitting private citizens to file lawsuits against others who aid a Missourian in traveling out of state for abortion care. Cortez Masto sponsored the bill and asked for unanimous consent for it to pass, but Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) objected, equating Cortez Masto’s bill to promoting child trafficking — triggering the former attorney general. “My colleagues on the far-right only cloak themselves in the Constitution when it suits them,” Cortez Masto said in a fiery retort. “And right now, it really doesn’t suit them … when they really can’t argue the facts and law of something, they just make things up.” And while the bills failed, the message was clear: Democrats will continue to make abortion a marquee election issue heading into 2024. It’s a message they believe is emotionally resonant enough to win elections. “The big takeaway is that for 50 years, we've had the right to control our reproductive freedom,” Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) said in an interview. “And now my daughter has less rights than I do.” A Nevada consensus Nevada voters famously cemented the right to an abortion up to 24 weeks in a 1990 ballot referendum with nearly two-thirds support — ensuring that language could only be modified or changed by another vote of the people. Legislatorsthis yeartook the first step toward advancing a state constitutional amendment codifying abortion rights, though the soonest it could make the ballot would be in 2026. That pro-abortion majority has stood firm over the ensuing decades. BeforeRoewas overturned, 69 percent of Nevadans described themselves as “pro-choice,” per a2021 OH Predictive Insights poll. Anotherpoll published in Aprilindicated that62 percent of Nevadans— including a plurality of Republicans, at 41 percent — want the right to an abortion further protected as a part of the state constitution. Democrats plan to use that consensus to their advantage. ""We will continue to remind Nevadans of Republicans’ extreme anti-choice agenda every day until next November,” Nevada Democratic Party spokesperson Johanna Warshaw said in a statement. In a state with legal gambling and brothels, the permissive attitude toward abortion is perhaps unsurprising. Caroline Mello Roberson, the southwest regional director of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said door-knocking gave her first-hand experience as to just how unique the issue is. She recalled going up to a house with a Ronald Reagan decal on the outside, nervously introducing herself and her cause, and then being met with an enthusiastic affirmation of a woman’s right to an abortion from the Republican man inside. TheDobbsdecision energized state abortion advocates, she said, making it “easier than ever before” to get people to call their representatives, testify at the state capitol and take on organizing work. In particular, she said young people — who the decision will most affect — and older people, who remember the pre-Roeworld, have become most engaged. “What [Dobbs] has done is made this front and center in people’s minds,” Roberson said. “They know that their ballot and their reproductive freedoms are intrinsically linked.” In the 2023 legislative session, the Legislature passed three reproductive rights-focused bills:SJR7, a proposed constitutional amendment enshrining the right to abortion in the state’s constitution;AB383, guaranteeing the right to prescribe and take contraception; andSB131, a state-level version of Cortez Masto’s bill protecting the right to travel to receive an abortion. Lombardo — whosaid on the 2022 campaign trailthat he would view any of his decision-making as a governor through a “pro-life lens” —signedthe travel protections bill, butvetoedthe bill guaranteeing access to contraception, saying it ““would unnecessarily restrict local officials’ autonomy”. Lombardo reflects the conundrum state Republicans find themselves in, many of whom haveskirted the issuesince theDobbsruling. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), the state’s lone congressional Republican, released a statement afterRoewas overturned calling himself “personally pro-life” but acknowledging the matter had been decided by Nevada voters. He has not put out another public statement on abortion since, and said in a recent interview he was uncomfortable when a federal judge invalidated the use of abortion drug mifepristone for all states, saying abortion questions should be decided at the state level. Similarly, when Republican Jim Marchant announced his run for Senate, his kickoff event was light on talk of abortion, despite declaring himself asproudly anti-abortionin his prior run for secretary of state. Roberson, who said NARAL began with 900 supporters in Nevada in 2016 and has grown to include 48,000 as abortion rights became imperiled across the country, said this legislative session was important for abortion access given that out-of-staters now make up half of patients in state abortion clinics — while also forcing Republicans like Lombardo to take stances. “Republican candidates here have always had a problem with this,” Roberson said. “That’s why you see them hedging with this.” Electoral effects State Democrats agree abortion was vital to defending the state’s Senate seat and three competitive House seats up in 2022. “It’s been a wakeup call for American women,” said Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV), who won re-election by a 4-point margin andattacked her opponent’s silence on abortion. “We’ve seen a mobilization across the country.” Mallory Payne, spokesperson for the state party, said abortion immediately became a top issue for voters after theDobbsdecision, and that it changed the energy of races — making it easier to find volunteers and drive turnout. Typically, the party of the president suffers significant congressional losses in midterm elections. In 2022 however, Democrats expanded on their Senate majority and only narrowly lost the House. Tanner Hale, president of Young Democrats of Nevada, said abortion re-energized Democratic campaigns by bringing the midterms onto friendly turf for Democrats — health care. Rosen won in 2018 in a race dominated by talk of the Affordable Care Act; COVID was a top issue for Democrats in 2020. But when young voters, in particular, saw the Supreme Court take abortion rights away, Hale said it was much easier to turn voters out. “We felt like we were on our heels,” Hale said. “And that ruling really kind of shifted the landscape back to a battleground, and I think the election showed that.” For federal elections, Democrats focused on Republican proposals to pass a national abortion ban, such as a15-week measureintroduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) in September and highlighted past remarks of their opponents, particularly those of Cortez Masto opponent Adam Laxalt, who calledRoe v. Wadea “joke” and had been involved inanti-abortion efforts as the state’s attorney general. It’s an issue where Democrats are able to draw sharp distinctions. “Even when I go to the floor of the Senate, I say [to Republicans], what is it about this issue that you do not trust women to make decisions on their own?” Cortez Masto said. “They can’t answer that. We see their answer: it is to ignore it.” After the leaked draft decision and eventualDobbsruling, some abortion advocates and left-wing voters expressed frustration with Democrats for never using majorities in the Clinton and Obama eras to codifyRoe, and for deprioritizing the issue while the right steadily built a strategy, hinging on the federal judiciary, strong enough to overturn precedent. The party has been split over whether or not to expand the Supreme Court to counteract the conservative majority responsible forDobbsand other rulings; progressives have called for additional justices, while moderate Democrats like Cortez Masto have maintained that “nine is enough,” a stance she reaffirmed in an interview this week. But in the year sinceDobbs, strategists said they’ve been impressed with how the state’s elected Democrats have risen to the occasion. Cortez Masto has been a “fantastic champion” for reproductive rights, Roberson said. But she admitted she had been frustrated earlier in Cortez Masto’s tenure over the length of time it took the senator (who has a penchant for being lawyerly) to speak out on abortion issues, including during the confirmation process of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. But sinceRoewas overturned, Cortez Masto has been proactive in calling out future rights that could be revoked, including contraception, travel and — with her legal background — becoming a reliably outspoken voice on court extremism, inDobbsand other cases such as an April one limiting the approval ofabortion drug mifepristone, which was later overruled. “Now, I see her proactively leading the charge,” Roberson said. “We’re really lucky that we have these two women senators that are such strong advocates for Nevadan values.” Rosen, for her part, speaks about abortion from a place of emotional empathy, rattling off a list of fertility circumstances that women are now endangered when facing, from miscarriages to ectopic pregnancies. She’s made abortion a totem of her nascent campaign already, immediately going on offense against potential opponent Marchant by highlightingabortion rightsin her response to his candidacy, saying he“opposes abortion rights even in cases of rape and incest” based on priorcandidatequestionnaires Sam Brown, another potential Rosen opponent, does not support abortion and said on his website, “it is in our American interest that we protect the lives of unborn babies just as we would protect the life of any other American.” Payne said the presidential race will also draw further attention to the topic in Nevada. “The entire GOP field is pushing for a national abortion ban,” she said. “It’s going to continue just being a really critical issue this cycle.” In a press conference Wednesday, Rosen made the electoral implications clear, saying the only line of defense against a national abortion ban is the Democratic majority in the Senate. Rosen and Nevada’s House Democrats will have the full thrust of the party behind them, as it plans to make abortion a rallying cry with the expectation that it will deliver both chambers to Democrats. “This extremism on reproductive freedoms will cost Republicans the House majority,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA), the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “We are going to ensure that we disqualify each and every Republican in these states for their stances on abortion.” While the election may come down to how salient abortion remains in the next year, and how voters weigh it against other issues, Rosen said it speaks to how Nevada’s values align with her own. “Nevada’s a pro-choice state,” she said. “This is really, fundamentally about women’s health, and our reproductive health care. It’s not just abortion — it’s really health care.”",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-officials-call-for-dismissal-of-gop-lawsuit-to-stop-presidential-primary-election,True,"State officials are pushing back against a lawsuit filed by the Nevada Republican Party to stop Nevada’s scheduled presidential primary election in February. The lawsuit and state response underscore an important electoral change for Nevada, which will finally move away from presidential caucuses to primary elections next year for both major political parties. Nevada is among the first states in both the Republican and Democratic presidential nominee selection calendar. Nevada Republicans last monthsuedto stop the enforcement ofAB126, which passed the Legislature in 2021, arguing that the bill’s requirement to hold a presidential preference primary (PPP) violates theirfreedom of association. The attorney general’s office — representing the secretary of state’s office — said last week in a response filing that the Nevada GOP’s argument does not hold legal merit, and that the party is not bound to accept the results of the primary election in how it allocates presidential delegates.  A state party official said the party would respond to the filing in court by Friday. Under the 2021 law, the state will hold a presidential primary election for both major political parties on Feb. 6, 2024, as long as more than one candidate has filed to run. Presidential candidates must file their candidacy with the secretary of state’s office between Oct. 1 and Oct. 15 of the year immediately preceding the election. The secretary of state’s office contends that state Republican leaders, who prefer caucuses, can opt to hold a caucus in addition to the primary election. While primaries are run by the government and use secret ballots, caucuses are run by political parties, require in-person participation and involve publicly indicating one’s preferred candidate. Under a caucus system, voters meeting at public locations such as schools and community centers physically form groups around a room depending on their preferred candidate.The process, which happens at a set time, can take hours and often involves voters trying to persuade each other to change their voting preference. The attorney general’s office said the primary election would boost security and confidence in the state’s elections because votes are cast in secret rather than through the public nature of a caucus. Officials also argued caucuses can be inaccessible for voters, especially those with language barriers or who are unable to participate at the set time of the caucus. A 2021pollof roughly 800 Nevadans found the majority backed a primary election rather than caucuses. The results of the presidential primary are non-binding, so state Republicans don’t have to use those election results when deciding how to allocate presidential delegates. “As a result, the NV GOP will not suffer any irreparable harm should the non-binding PPP election process go forward,” attorneys wrote in their response. The state party has until Oct. 1 to decide how to award presidential delegates, according to the Republican National Committeebylaws. Like a normal primary or general election, the presidential primary will see the state send sample ballots in the mail, establish voting locations and allow voting by mail and overseas ballots for the military. Voters should expect to receive sample ballots in late December or early January. For a voter to participate in the PPP election, they must be registered to vote with one of the two major parties. The counties then will canvass election returns, and the secretary of state’s office will compile the tabulations and send them to the party’s state and national committees, which can choose to ignore those results in favor of results from caucuses. Though rare, a political party has chosen to hold a caucus and primary for the same election. InWashingtonin 2016, Democrats held a caucus and presidential primary. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) won the caucus, while Hillary Clinton’s PPP victory was symbolic because party officials used the caucus results to award delegates. National Democrats this year approved calendar changes that will comply with AB126, slotting Nevada as tied for second in the state primary election order. The Feb. 6 primary is the same day as New Hampshire’s election and three days after the South Carolina contest. That’s a boost from the 2020 Democratic caucuses, when the Silver State was third in line behind Iowa and New Hampshire. Republicans, however, haveoptedto keep their presidential nominating calendar the same as it was in 2020, with Nevada in the third slot behind Iowa and New Hampshire. Republicans in Nevada have so far balked at the change from a caucus to a primary. In their lawsuit filed last month in the First Judicial District Court in Carson City, the GOP claimed the requirement to hold a primary election violates the party’s right to freedom of association, and asked the court to either prohibit the state from holding a primary election or allow the results to be nonbinding. The lawsuit cited the legislative proceedings forSB292, another 2021 bill that dealt with the inner workings of political parties. The GOP argues in its lawsuit that SB292 recognizes the right of freedom of association and independence of political parties, and that AB126 is unlawfully interfering in party workings. The state objected to that argument, claiming that because state and national party leadership can ignore the results of the PPP when allocating delegates, AB126 does not infringe on internal party processes. “Nevada's diverse population is an important representation of the makeup of the entire country, and holding the presidential primary elections earlier elevates the voices of Nevadans in selecting who should lead the country,” the attorney general’s office said last week in its legal response.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/desantis-aside-few-presidential-hopefuls-heading-to-early-state-nevada,True,"When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantistook the Basque Fry stagein Gardnerville on Saturday, he became the first officially declared 2024 presidential candidate to hold a public event in the Silver State. Relative to the rest of the GOP field, DeSantis made an early splash. But relative to prior Republican contests, Nevada has been little more than an afterthought to the growing presidential primary field, even though there are fewer than eight months remaining until the state’s Feb. 6 primary. Candidates have instead lavished attention on South Carolina, New Hampshire, and particularly first-to-go Iowa, where everyone from the former president to the little-known governor of North Dakota has held events, paid for ad blitzes and jockeyed for attention in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids. That’s not the case so far in Las Vegas, Carson City or Reno, whichby this point in 2015hosted nearly 20 events between the three cities with eight different Republican presidential hopefuls. Strategists interviewed byThe Nevada Independentagreed that the 2016 nominating race was considered far more open than 2024’s contest, when Trump was a dark horse in a crowded field rather than a former president withdouble-digit polling leadsand a strong political base to boot. Even without those institutional advantages, Trump handilywonthe state’s 2016 presidential caucus, receiving almost double the votes of second-place finisher, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL). State party leaderscanceledthe 2020 caucus and awarded the state’s delegates to Trump. “President Trump's folks are basically doing the drumbeat of — we've got it wrapped up,” said Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), the state’s lone Republican in Congress. “Obviously, the other folks have something to say about that….I just think it's a much more cautious atmosphere at the moment.” An analysis from ad tracking firm AdImpact found that only $557,000 out of $40.3 million spent on GOP primary ads (just over 1 percent) have targeted Nevada thus far in 2023, per anNBC Newsreport. The low spending figures may be a function of a top-heavy race, in whichTrump and DeSantishave super PACs with tens of millions in their coffers, and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) has over $20 million in his Senate account, while the other candidates, particularly those newer to the race, are lower on funds. Recent pollsin Nevada show Trump with commanding 30-point leads over DeSantis. Strategists said Trump’s devoted base and state party support means DeSantis, even with a well-timed visit, is already playing catch-up. Trump’s past success in Nevada and advantages in the state might even be what’s keeping other candidates from making early investments. The lack of attention could be creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, where candidates’ concerns that Trump already has the state in the bag is enabling the conditions for exactly that to occur. However, that lack of attention, strategists said, could give a lower-polling candidate a golden opportunity. Zachary “Oso” Guymon, a partner at Reformation Strategies, a Republican political consultant firm not working for any 2024 candidates and who worked on Sen. Rand Paul’s (R-KY) 2016 campaign, said candidates (particularly those with lower name recognition) should begin investing in Nevada. Given that Nevada’s media market is undersaturated especially compared to Iowa, the value of an ad dollar in Las Vegas could be far more potent than it is in Des Moines. “If I was advising Tim Scott or [Nikki] Haley or any of them, I’d say, ‘Look, you can play around in Iowa — but Nevada, it’s pretty open right now,’” Guymon said. Nevada’s disadvantages The lack of attention is not just perception. Guymon said his firm has begun to receive preliminary calls from campaigns, but said none of the 10-plus declared candidates has yet put significant resources in place. Amy Tarkanian, a former state Republican Party chair, said she has yet to hear of any candidates besides Trump and DeSantis setting up a ground game. DeSantis, with the support of a super PAC and a well-known state surrogate in former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who was the Florida governor’s roommate at Naval Justice School, is the notable exception as someone who has begun to invest resources into the state. Another sign of Nevada’s inconsequentiality at this point is a lack of major endorsements, outside of Laxalt. As two of the most prominent elected Republicans, Gov. Joe Lombardo and Amodei should be coveted supporters. But Amodei said the only candidate that has reached out to him is DeSantis. The two spoke on the phone recently. “They haven't been concentrating on Nevada as much,” Amodei said. “I assume that that must be a function of Republicans that are doing the metrics for these folks, in terms of the road to the nomination, haven't got Nevada figured as one of those crossroads at this point as opposed to the last times.” Further complicating calculations is the unknown status of what kind of contest Republicans in the state will hold. State law establishes a primary on Feb. 6, but the state GOP issuingto hold a caucus instead — an opt-out that is permissible, though it would come at greater financial cost to the party. Nevada also has structural disadvantages compared to the other early states. As a Western state, travel is more difficult and expensive for the many East Coast-based candidates. Whereas Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) had lived in Las Vegas as a child and made Nevada a major part of his 2016 campaign, and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) heavily courted Nevada’s Mormon population in 2012, none of the campaigns (save for Trump’s Las Vegas hotel) have much of a connection to Nevada. One strategist even suggested that the death of casino magnate and megadonor Sheldon Adelson, and his widow Miriam’spledgeto stay neutral in the primary, could mean less of an incentive for candidates to stop in Nevada, and instead center their West Coast swings in financially greener pastures in California. (One potential draw is the Republican Jewish Coalition, which has anannual summitin October that typically attracts presidential hopefuls.) And given Nevada falls after Iowa and New Hampshire on the Republican presidential calendar, smaller campaigns may go all in on those states, figuring their hopes may be dashed by the time Nevada holds its contest unless they can get a strong foothold in the earlier states. Strategists emphasized that the latter scenario is a reasonable concern — very few campaigns have been able to survive losing the first three states and banking on a later state to come to the rescue, though Joe Biden notably bucked the trend. “If you don't make it past Iowa and South Carolina, and you're running on fumes, then you're in a world of hurt,” said Tarkanian, a former state GOP chair. But strategists also agreed such an approach could be short-sighted, because the Nevada electorate is receptive to retail politics. Even if a dark horse candidate were to do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, there’s no guarantee Nevada Republicans would simply hop on the bandwagon. “Nevada doesn’t just fall into place,” said Peter Koltak, a senior adviser on Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) successful 2020 operation in Nevada. Nevada long figured into Sanders’ calculations as early as 2015, when hevisitedLas Vegas as part of his long-shot bid to unseat presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton. The campaign made a conscious decision to invest early in 2020 in the Silver State, which has a  Democratic electorate mirroring the populations the Sanders campaign believed — correctly — it could win. Koltak said the Sanders campaign began building out its Nevada ground game as early as April 2019. “Those early touches can be important to getting people's minds opened up to the prospect of coming out to support you,” Koltak said. “You can't put together a winning operation late in a state like Nevada.” The Trump advantage Strategists agreed that the longer candidates go without investing in Nevada, the greater the advantage for Donald Trump. Trump has campaigned in the state twice, has a strong grassroots following, can more easily tap into his prior infrastructure from his past runs and has the backing of the state party apparatus, stacked with close allies such as chair Michael McDonald — someone heavily involved in state efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Tarkanian said given how deeply the state party — with its resources to do door-knocking, phone banking, and volunteering for candidates — is in the tank for Trump, she’s not surprised that other candidates may have written Nevada off. “If you're somebody who's not named Trump, are you going to be able to get the support that you need?” Tarkanian said. “Are they going to remain neutral? Or are they going to cause shenanigans behind the scenes? You don't know.” Clark County GOP Chair Jesse Law said in February that Trump has a “built-in base” in Nevada that he expects the former president to easily mobilize. Guymon said developing a state office and building a ground game takes time and effort, but that every candidate should have already made a quick fly-in visit to the state — something only DeSantis has done. That matters, he said, even if it doesn’t yield a boost in the polls. “It’s retail politics,” he said. “Anytime you can get in front of people, be early and be seen, it’s definitely a benefit.” To truly crack Trump’s base in Nevada, more candidates beyond DeSantis will need to take the state seriously — and soon. “If nobody's really spending money on building a foundation in Nevada then I think that would favor Donald Trump,” Amodei said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/desantis-targets-the-left-not-trump-at-northern-nevada-basque-fry,True,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis this weekend became the first declared presidential candidate to visit Nevada, pitching himself as a leader who would restore sanity and normalcy to a nation in decline. The Republican governor's comments came Saturday at the annual conservative Basque Fry event hosted by his longtime friend — and now head of a pro-DeSantis super PAC — former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt. Speaking before a crowd of an estimated 2,500 people at the Gardnerville-area Corley Ranch in Northern Nevada, DeSantis, a former congressman in his second term as Florida governor, leaned on his culture warrior bonafides. In a 50-minute stump speech, he cast Florida as a conservative model for the nation and railed against “leftist” Democratic governments “destroying” cities and states — and avoided direct mention of his top competitor for the GOP nomination, former President Donald Trump. “This country is in decline,” DeSantis said. “But I don't think that decline is inevitable. I think it's a choice. It's a choice we as Americans will make over these next 18 months.” DeSantis’ visit marked one of his first opportunities to win over Republican voters who have ardently supported Trump in a key swing state where voters have supported the winning presidential candidate in all but two elections since 1912. It also came as the first visit from a major candidate to Nevada in the 2024 presidential cycle, as Republican candidates have so far swarmed other early states in the Midwest and southeast. The annual Basque Fry, hosted about 50 miles south of Reno, was launched in 2015 by friends of Laxalt, who most recently lost to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) in a U.S. Senate race last year. Alongside Laxalt’s Morning in Nevada PAC, this year’seventwas also put on by Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting DeSantis’ presidential bid that is chaired by Laxalt. Despite his loss last year, Laxalt told the crowd he was more motivated than ever, throwing his full support behind his former roommate in naval officer training, DeSantis, while taking fire at the national media, “corporations that have made this massive left wing swing” and those who identify as transgender. “We know it is encroaching on our values,” Laxalt said. Over the past eight years, the annual jamboree rooted in Basque culture has become one of the nation’s most prominent events for national conservative politicians — and one that features a Basque speciality, lamb fries (sliced, breaded and fried lamb testicles), as its marquee dish. Read more about the history and significance of the Basque Fryhere. Though typically held in the doldrums of late summer, this year’s Basque Fry came weeks early, as DeSantis and others took the stage against a backdrop of the Eastern Sierras on a warm, 80-degree day. The ranch grounds were filled with hundreds of cowboy boot-clad attendees donning red — including “Make America Great Again” hats and American flag apparel. Last year’s Basque Frydrewa mix of national and local GOP figures, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and now-Gov. Joe Lombardo, who at the time had only recently emerged victorious from a 15-person Republican primary for governor. Lombardo had initially been billed as a guest at this year’s Basque Fry, but did not attend, and is expected to make an appearance Saturday at the Vegas Golden Knights' championship parade in Las Vegas. On Friday, DeSantis accompanied Laxalt and Rick Reviglio, president of Western Nevada Supply Co.,to the Reno Rodeo, kicking off the presidential hopeful’s visit to Northern Nevada with an appearance in purple battleground Washoe County. Prior to the launch of his candidacy, DeSantis made a trip toLas Vegas in Marchas part of his promotional Florida Blueprint book tour. Trump has yet to visit Nevada since announcing his presidential campaign officially in November, though prior to that, he visitedLas Vegas in Julylast year andMinden in Northern Nevada in October— both times boosting the campaigns of Laxalt and Lombardo. Florida as a national model Describing Florida as a haven of fiscal responsibility and conservative policy, protected from left-leaning policies, DeSantis leaned on his accomplishments as Florida governor in pitching his vision for the nation. He spoke about the response he led to COVID-19, emphasizing his pride in decisions to lift mask mandates and restore in-person schooling earlier than other states. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that Floridaranked 18thamong states with the highest COVID-19 mortality rates in 2021. He also emphasized his fight against “woke ideology” and “leftism” — the word “woke” was uttered 13 times in a three-minute span — pointing to his efforts as governor totake on Disneyand eliminate discussions of gender and sexual identity in schools. But DeSantis’ criticism of “woke ideology” extended well beyond the classroom, as he also attacked banks and the use of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and faltering military recruitment rates — both victims of what he described as “a war on truth itself.” “We can't let our country descend into some type of dumpster fire of woke ideology,” he said. DeSantis also sought to appeal to the Nevada Republican audience, saying that one thing the Silver State and Florida have in common is that both “receive a lot of disgruntled Californians.” On another common feature between the two states — no state income tax — DeSantis said he would follow suit at the federal level to eliminate income taxes across the country, saying the federal government should “get rid of the IRS and send it off into the sunset.” Another topic DeSantis focused on was his commitment to “law and order” and taking a strong stance on crime and immigration.“We are tough on crime in Florida and we have enacted a whole bunch of those provisions including authorizing the death penalty for pedophiles in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said. He also highlighted a political stunt where he sentbuses of immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard— an island in Massachusetts, which Florida officialsdescribedas a “sanctuary” destination — as an example of his commitment to addressing an immigration status and following through on his promises. ""The other thing we're going to do is I will be the president to finally bring the issue of the southern border to a conclusion,"" DeSantis said, noting he wants to ""shut down the border,"" ""actually build a border wall"" and hold drug cartels accountable. One of DeSantis’ major talking points centered around education, and his implementation of school choice initiatives in Florida and the ability for Florida parents to “direct the education and upbringing of their children.” DeSantis also said under his watch as governor, Florida eliminated Critical Race Theory in the state’s K-12 educational systems. Critical Race Theory has become a central focus of conservatives in a culture war that has asserted the academic idea is an indoctrination designed to make children hate themselves, with Nevada candidates during the 2022 election, including Laxalt, seeking to ban it.However, Critical Race Theory isprimarily taught in law schoolor in some undergraduate- or graduate-level courses and, asdefined byEducationWeek,is an academic concept that focuses on the idea that “race is a social construct, and that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice, but also something embedded in legal systems and policies.” The long shadow of Donald Trump DeSantis’ visit comes at a time when his campaign has intensified its feud with that of Trump, whose continuing popularity among the Republican base nationwide has forced GOP hopefuls to tread a fine line on attacking the former president — even as he has now faced two criminal indictments, including afederal indictment issued last weekover his handling of classified documents. The tightrope act was on full display Saturday, as voters waiting to hear DeSantis toldThe Nevada Independentthat they still leaned toward Trump. That includes Ron Dayton, a 72-year-old retired Marine, who said he wanted to hear DeSantis defend Trump from what he called the “nasty precedent” set by the Department of Justice pursuing criminal charges against the former president. “From DeSantis to the other candidates, they’re not impressing me because they've joined the Democrats and the media to side against Trump with these false allegations,” Dayton said. “They should be standing for the Constitution and such as that, and they're not. They're totally silent on it.” Likewise, Tom Stribling, 58, said he wanted DeSantis to address China and immigration in his stump — and “speak out and help Trump a little bit.” “I mean, bring the world together instead of dividing it,” Stribling said. Still, DeSantis had strong support from attendees who framed him as an electable candidate. Greg Karol, 60 — a former Florida resident now living in Carson City — said the Florida governor was “far more qualified, as a professional, for the job.” “I think Trump brings with him a lot of theatrics and issues and things like that,” Karol said.  ""Plus, he can only go for another four years, DeSantis could go eight. The policies are similar. There's a lot less noise.” Others, meanwhile, remained on the fence. Dianne Dickey, a 62-year-old resident of Gardnerville, said she loved what Trump accomplished as president, but was concerned that he is too divisive. On the other hand, she was supportive of DeSantis’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A deepening campaign feud But as the campaign season has accelerated, new rifts have opened. The Trump-DeSantis feud now also includes simmering tensions between the Trump camp and Laxalt, who had been the state’s most prominent ally to the former president and even co-chaired Trump’s Nevada campaign in 2020, wherehe was centralto the post-election public and legal campaign pushingunsubstantiated claimsof mass voter fraud. Even as Trump lost both general elections in 2016 and 2020 in the Silver State, Nevada’s top Republicans have long embraced him as their standard bearer. The real estate mogul won the state’s 2016 caucus by 22 percentage points, winning all but two rural counties and securing more than 45 percent of the vote in a field then filled with 11 candidates. Not only did Trump’s campaign join with the state GOP to claim voter fraud after losing Nevada in 2020, but state party chair Michael McDonald has since becomeembroiledin the Trump campaign’s plan to submit slates of “false electors” voting for Trump in the electoral college. Trump’s presence also loomed over state races in Nevada last year. During agubernatorial debatein October, when asked if Trump was a “great” president, Lombardo said: “I wouldn’t say great. I think he was a sound president.” But his campaign walked back that comment hours later, saying in a statement that “Trump was a great president.” Still, some within the party have now signaled a willingness to move away from Trump. Only days before the event Saturday, Laxalttold theReno Gazette-JournalandNBC Newsthat he believed voters were ready to move on from Trump to DeSantis. “I was a two-time Trump chair. I don’t see a path for him to win Nevada in a general election. Those voters are not coming back,” he said. The Trump campaign has since publicly bristled at the defection. Ahead of the Basque Fry (and the fried lamb testicles served there), Chris LaCivita, a senior campaign adviser,toldNBC NewsFriday he was “not surprised Ron DeSantis is looking for a set of balls.” “So Adam Laxalt, who lost the governor’s race in ’18 and lost the Senate race in ’22, is lecturing President Trump?” LaCivita toldNBC. “That’s the pot calling the kettle black.” Conservative voices pitch DeSantis for Nevada, nation In the leadup to DeSantis’ speech Saturday, the Basque Fry featured remarks from several conservative pundits and politicians who amplified DeSantis’ message of anti-wokeness and argued that he provides a vision for the country’s future through Florida. That included political talk show host Dave Rubin, Never Back Down spokesman Steve Cortes and Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony. “We are losing our country. That's the bad news. Here's the good news. It's not too late to save it. We can save our country, and we must save our country, but to save it, we need to win elections,” Cortes said. “DeSantis is the right leader — the man who can both win the election and govern as a capable and highly effective conservative populist president.” Those supporting DeSantis pointed to his history in Florida of taking on political and policy battles that have aligned closely with national Republican views. That includes signing billsbanning abortionsafter six weeks of pregnancy andrestricting LGBTQ+ rights, as well as waging aculture war against Disney. Laxalt, in particular, praised those decisions from DeSantis, saying he “was the first governor to ban transgender ideology in their schools in Florida.” (Transgender does not refer to an ideology, but is a term used to describe people whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.) Laxalt also emphasized that DeSantis would rise to the challenge as a “conservative warrior,” arguing he is the only candidate capable of winning a presidential primary and general election. “We need discipline, we need focus, and if we don't do this now, we are going to lose our country,” he said.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/d-c-download-where-republican-presidential-candidates-stand-on-yucca,True,"With nine major Republicans declared to run for president, I looked through their past statements to see what they think of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository — long a political barometer in the Silver State. Plus, Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) reacts to the latest Trump indictment, and Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) visits Lake Mead to announce new federal funding. The Republican field on Yucca When Donald Trump first took office, his personal opinion on the use of Yucca Mountain to store nuclear wasteseemed unclear. But his Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, made the administration’s position clear — he wanted to proceed with the use of the site, which had been developed in the 1980s but been successfully diverted ever since by Nevada lawmakers. Trump’s 2017 budget called for Yucca funding, and Perrytestified to Congressabout its “moral obligation” to provide the funds to bring the site online. Though the House took him up on it, the bill died in the Senate as part of an effort to protect then-Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV), who was up for re-election the next year. The Nevada delegation beat back multiple subsequent attempts to license the project in 2019. By 2020, Trump had changed his tune,tweeting, “Nevada, I hear you on Yucca Mountain and my Administration will RESPECT you!” TheBiden administrationhas also taken no steps to fund the nuclear waste site at the Southern Nevada location. So while we know where Biden and Trump stand on Yucca — at least for now — the other eight major Republican candidates have yet to weigh in on the topic (or visit Nevada at all, except for FloridaGov. Ron DeSantis, but that’s a story for another day.) None of the Republican campaigns responded to inquiries about their candidates’ stances on the nuclear waste storage site. But quite a few have prior statements or voting records on Yucca, which I’ve aggregated below. Ron DeSantis During his time in Congress, DeSantis, like all but five House Republicans, voted for theNuclear Waste Policy Amendments Actof 2018, which would have authorized the storage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. And he tookseveralvotesover his five years in the House to the same effect, voting against amendments stripping Yucca funding from federal budgets. The Trump campaign has taken note. “Ron DeSantis Wants to Make Nevada a Nuclear Waste Dumping Ground…And It Gets Worse From There,” read aMay statementfrom team Trump. Perhaps DeSantis will respond at former Attorney General Adam Laxalt’s Basque Fry next weekend, which he’s slated to headline. Nikki Haley As governor of South Carolina in 2015, Nikki Haley had some harsh words for then-President Barack Obama and then-Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), who convinced Obama to drop Yucca plans. ""President Obama and Harry Reid are willing to shut down Yucca and make South Carolina a permanent dumping ground to save Harry Reid's Senate seat.” Haleysaidat the time. “That’s wrong. We are not interested in investing in any more Nevada real estate when we get nothing in return.” Haley spoke out after touring theSavannah River Site, which stores radioactive waste in the western part of South Carolina. She said if the federal government did not intend to open Yucca, it should refund all the money it has poured into studying and developing the site. Tim Scott As a member of Congress since 2011, Scott was on the Senate Energy & Natural Resources committee in 2014, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’sreportfinding that Yucca was a safe storage site came out. ""Despite politically motivated delays to the Yucca Mountain project, it is clearer than ever that this is the safest, most viable location for storing our nation's nuclear waste,” Scott said at the time, in a shot at Reid. “We must have a long-term strategy, as this is not an issue that can be wished away.” He added that South Carolina had taken on an outsized burden in the wake of Nevada’s continued objections to Yucca moving forward, and that South Carolina had contributed over a billion toward the project with no result. Mike Pence Long before he was vice president, Pence was a member of the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013, meaning he voted on the initial 2002 approval of the project. Pence, a staunch conservative, was one of just 13 House Republicans in 2002 to vote against approving the storage site at Yucca Mountain. In his vice presidential years, he didn’t touch the issue on trips to Nevada either as a campaign surrogate or representative of the Trump administration. Chris Christie As governor of New Jersey, Christiecalled onthe U.S. to find a permanent solution for nuclear waste storage in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. And he authorized the state to join a lawsuit with New York, Connecticut and Vermont against the federal government, saying its inability to find a long-term storage option was injurious to states with nuclear power facilities. (The states ended upwinningthe lawsuit.) When the Nuclear Regulatory Commission changed the amount of time waste can be stored at individual plants from 30 years to 60 years in 2011, Christie criticized the agency. ""Maintaining that type of material in a shuttered plant for 60 years could be a danger to the safety and welfare of the people of New Jersey,"" he said. But he did not specifically say whether Yucca should become the solution. Asa Hutchinson I could not find any comments from the former Arkansas governor on Yucca or nuclear waste. Doug Burgum The longshot North Dakota governor joined the Western Governors Association in a 2019lettersaying states deserve greater control over nuclear waste policies that affect them — a popular opinion among Nevada’s congressional delegation. The letter pertained to the release of a new five-year federal plan for nuclear repository in New Mexico. “Western Governors request that states be provided with advance notice and significant details about these projects, as they could influence shipment schedules and associated planning efforts in states,” Burgum, as WGA president, wrote. Vivek Ramaswamy I could not find any comments from the biotech, “anti-woke” entrepreneur on Yucca or nuclear waste. Amodei on the federal Trump indictment Donald Trump became the first former president to be federally indicted Thursday, with the Justice Department bringing seven counts against him in relation to his handling of over 300 classified documents. Thecharges againstTrump include violating the Espionage Act, making false statements and conspiring to obstruct justice, per theNew York Times. The prosecutors also discovered an audio clip from 2021 in which Trump discusses a classified document on military strategies in Iran with aides, acknowledging that he could no longer declassify it as an ex-president and wishing he had done so while in office. Trump maintained his innocence in a series of posts on Truth Social, calling the indictment politically motivated, raging against special prosecutor Jack Smith’s record, saying Biden was a hypocrite given classified documents werediscovered in his home offices, and adding that the U.S. is in “serious and rapid decline.” Reactions to the indictment on the right have run the gamut, with Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) rushing to his defense while others have remained mum, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and several of Trump’s 2024 primary opponents, including Mike Pence and Nikki Haley. In a statement, Amodei — Nevada’s only Republican in Congress and the chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state — leaned toward the McCarthy view. “I am deeply suspicious of Donald Trump’s indictment, especially since the Department of Justice is not also indicting President Biden for doing the same thing,” Amodei said. “It is a fact that President Biden kept classified documents for decades. The American people are intelligent and see this ploy for exactly what it is: the weaponization of the federal government against Joe Biden’s leading political opponent.” A probe into Biden’s handling of classified documents from his time as vice president, as well as one for Pence, who also was found to have classified documents, isstill underway. In addition, Trump possessed many more documents than either Biden or Pence, the contents of which are still mostly unknown. “Our country has multiple significant fundamental issues to deal with presently,” Amodei continued. “This continuing obsession of the political ends justify any means, regardless of the harm to our republic, is a sad commentary on our current state.” Rosen announces $32 million for Lake Mead boating Rosen spent her Monday at Lake Mead, announcing $32 million in federal disaster relief funds for recreation aid to the embattled reservoir and discussing the plan for boat ramps heading into the summer. “When local businesses at Lake Mead reached out to my office with concerns about how boat ramp closures were hurting them, I took action right away to get these ramps reopened and secure the funding needed to keep them open,” Rosen said in a statement. She said the federal funding, which was appropriated in last December’s omnibus spending bill, will ensure the boat ramps operate this summer. In recentNational Park Service plansto address falling water levels at the lake amid the mega-drought, the agency proposed permanent boat launch closures — an action Rosen objected to. Low water levels had led to the suspension of the use of all but one boat ramp. She submitted aletter in Marchwith Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Arizona’s two senators asking for appropriated disaster relief funds to include infrastructure repairs for recreation activities on Lake Mead. Lake Mead, with water levels reaching historic lows in recent years, experienced aquick riselast month due to an unusually high snowpack in the Upper Colorado River Basin. But the persistence of the drought keeps the risk level high for the man-made lake. Bruce Nelson, the director of operations at Lake Mead Marina, said in a statement that Rosen’s advocacy will help companies that have struggled under the weight of drought and subsequent declining tourism. “She took on this issue by fighting to reopen the boat ramps, saving the small businesses that depend on them,” Nelson said. 2024 Watch Bill Conrad jumps into Senate race We have a West Point graduate and military veteran in Nevada’s U.S. Senate race … but it’s not the one you’re thinking of. While Sam Brown is still mulling a run and former Assemblyman Jim Marchantalready announced, retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel Bill Conrad has announced his entry into the Republican primary for Nevada’s Senate seat in 2024. Conrad, who has not yet filed with the Federal Election Commission, also ran in 2022, where he finished fourth among listed Republican candidates with about 1.5 percent of the vote. “As each day passes without an announcement from Brown, I find my campaign growing stronger. Brown and I share a similar background, both being West Point graduates,” Conrad told me in an email. Conrad, who lives in Reno and spent 35 years in the military, lists his priorities as cutting taxes, eliminating regulations, shrinking the size of the federal government, promoting strong national security and replacing McConnell as Senate Republicans’ leader with a more conservative member. In a self-publishedelection guide, Conrad touted his experience as a combat veteran, in business and as a former city councilman in Modesto, California. He told me he’ll be officially announcing on July 4 in Las Vegas and then begin a statewide tour in October. “For too long, an elite in a far-distant capital has controlled us through mandates, orders, and administrative directives,” Conrad wrote on his website. “It is time for this to stop and never happen again!” Americans for Prosperity takes a shot at Rosen Americans for Prosperity, the Koch-founded libertarian advocacy group, held an event at a Shell station in Las Vegas on Tuesday paying the difference of the cost of gas between the day Biden took office and its current price for 200 drivers — all to make a statement against Democrats’ energy policies. AFP called on Rosen to pass the Lower Energy Costs Act, a House Republican-backed bill that would roll back environmental protections and promote oil and gas drilling that Senate Democrats are firmly against. The event is part of an eight-figure campaign in battleground 2024 states, including Nevada, to criticize vulnerable Senate Democrats such as Rosen.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/former-ambassador-to-iceland-jeffrey-gunter-mulling-senate-run-in-nevada,True,"Jeffrey Ross Gunter, a health care executive and former Trump-appointed U.S. ambassador to Iceland, has launcheda websitehinting at a potential run for U.S. Senate in Nevada. TheNevada GlobereportedGunter is “mulling a run” to join a Republican primary field that includes former state assemblyman Jim Marchant and is expected to includeretired U.S. Army Captain Sam Brownin a race to take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) next November. Gunter did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Gunter, a dermatologist whose private practice is based in California but includes offices in both Henderson and Pahrump, is a longtime Republican donor. From a California address, he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years to Trump-aligned PACs and Republican groups and campaigns. Past contributions were made to Dean Heller’s successful 2012 senatorial campaign, Adam Laxalt’s failed 2022 Senate bid, and to the Nevada Republican Central Committee. His website asks to “Help Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter fulfill our promise to make America Great Again!” before prompting users to provide contact information, though it does not mention a specific race. The website adds that Gunter is “continuing the fight for freedom” that he began as an ambassador. In a statement to theGlobe, Gunter said he is assessing how to further the MAGA agenda. “As a longtime Nevada resident, physician, small business owner, and former US Ambassador, the wide open GOP primary race only re-enforces the urgency for a strong America First candidate to represent the constituents of our great state,” Gunter said. As ambassador, Gunter touts the building of a new embassy in Reykjavik, overseeing the move to the new embassy with zero COVID cases, and said he participated in national security initiatives countering Russia and China from his post. But Gunter’s time as ambassador was marked by turnover and a series of negative headlines in the Icelandic press. After being confirmed to the post in 2019, Gunter in one year went through seven deputy chiefs of mission (DCM), who help ensure continuity in embassies as the second in command, according to a2020 Senate Democrat staff report. Gunter reportedly fired his first DCM after one meeting because he “didn’t like the look of him,” according to aCBS Newsinvestigation. Gunter also generated controversy in 2020, when he became paranoid about security in Reykjavik and petitioned the State Department to allow him to carry a firearm and receive armored car service, perCBS News. He was reportedly talked down from his request given that it would offend the host nation, which has strict gun laws. AnOffice of the Inspector General reportfound Gunter had created a “threatening and intimidating environment,” including raging at subordinates, threatening lawsuits against his staff, and accusing them of being part of a“deep state” conspiracy, perCBS. He also left his post at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, returning to California and attempting to conduct diplomacy remotely until personally called by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to tell Gunter to return to Reykjavik in May 2020, according to the CBS report.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-gop-sues-state-wants-to-hold-a-2024-presidential-caucus,True,"The Nevada GOP filed alawsuitWednesday against the state over a 2021 law dropping its presidential caucus and establishing a presidential primary in the state. Cisco Aguilar, in his official role as secretary of state, was also named a defendant in the suit, which was filed by the party’s 2022 attorney general candidate and Republican National Committeewoman Sigal Chattah in the First Judicial District Court in Carson City. In 2021, Gov. Steve Sisolak (D)signed lawstransitioning Nevada from a caucus to a presidential primary, and moving the date for it to be held to the first Tuesday in February, advancing the state in the presidential nominating calendar. Since then, the Democratic Party passed aschedulethat calls for Nevada and New Hampshire to hold concurrent primaries on that date, going second after South Carolina. The law was opposed by Republicans in the Legislature. TheRepublican Partywants to keep the traditional Iowa-New Hampshire-South Carolina-Nevada schedule and maintain the state’s caucus model, which the 2021 law, enacted throughAB126, would presumably foil. While primaries are run by governments and use secret ballots, caucuses are run by political parties, require in-person participation, and involve publicly indicating one’s preferred candidate. In a statement, Nevada’s GOP said its lawsuit would ensure only Republicans can set the date of the Republican nominating contest. “Due to the inability of Nevada Democrats to execute a smooth, efficient caucus, they want to use unaccountable dark money in an attempt to force Republicans to change the way we choose our Presidential nominee, and allow out-of-state interests to interfere in the Nevada GOP nominating process,” the state party said in a statement. “The first four early states continue to stand together to maintain our historic role in the Presidential nominating process.” However, the secretary of state’s office said in a statement that the 2021 law permits parties to conduct a caucus if they so choose, as they understand it. The lawsuit claims the 2021 law violates the First Amendment’s guarantee to “freedom of association” — verbiage not technically enumerated in the Constitution though found by the Supreme Court to exist in aCivil Rights-era case. The complaint argues that a political party’s right to select its own presidential candidates is an intrinsic part of freedom of association, and that the 2021 law negates this right by forcing the GOP to hold a primary rather than a caucus. The lawsuit argues that the Legislature expressly recognized this right in its discussion and passage ofSB292, which also passed in 2021, and removed language about the organization of political parties from the state law. “AB126 is notable because it seemingly precludes a major political party such as the NV GOP from opting out of the primary election process, and thus impedes its ability to pursue a party-run caucus system (or other permissible method) instead,” the lawsuit says. The Legislature decided to move to a primary after the tumultuous 2020 Democratic caucus. Though Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was declared the winner of the state’s presidential caucus on the same day as the caucus, full results wereunavailablefortwo daysafterwards. And after thedisastrous Iowa caucus, Nevada Democrats begancallingfor the switch to a primary. If the Nevada GOP decides to hold acaucusrather than a primary, it could set its own date. Doing so, however, would entail forgoing the funding and coordination of a state-administered primary. In states including Alaska and Kentucky, Republicans hold a caucus while Democrats have a primary. But the lawsuit alleges that AB126 precludes the Nevada GOP from opting out of the primary system, and the party is asking the court for a writ of prohibition to bar Aguilar from enforcing the bill. The text of AB126 states that “a presidential preference primary election must be held for all major political parties on the first Tuesday in February” unless the party only has one or zero candidates. The lawsuit interprets the “must” as pertaining to holding a primary — as opposed to a primary, if it is held, needing to occur on the aforementioned date — and asks the court for an exemption. Furthermore, the lawsuit asks that, even if the court finds that the state can compel the GOP to hold a primary, it allows the results of said primary to be nonbinding, which would permit party leadership to assign its delegates regardless of the results of the vote. The national party can recognize — or not recognize —any form of nomination contest it wants. Nevada State Democratic Party spokesperson Mallory Payne said the lawsuit is another effort by Republicans to limit voter access, given that Democrats moved to a primary in order to simplify the voting process. “Republicans aren’t even trying that hard to hide their intentions,” she said in a statement. “They’re doing whatever it takes to protect their MAGA leader and get Trump over the finish line.” .",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/national-republicans-recruiting-sam-brown-to-challenge-rosen,True,"Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, is recruiting retired U.S. Army Captain Sam Brown to run for Nevada’s U.S. Senate seat in 2024, according to a national Republican strategist. Brown, who suffered severe burns in combat during a deployment in Afghanistan, previously ran for a U.S. Senate seat in the state’s 2022 Republican primary,running a spirited but ultimately unsuccessfulprimary campaign against former Attorney General Adam Laxalt. Brown is now “seriously exploring” a run, according to a GOP consultant close to him who was granted anonymity to speak freely about Brown’s plans. Though he has not yet made a formal decision, Brown is “far along” in his process of deliberating with consultants, members of the state-level GOP apparatus, prior donors and supporters, the consultant said. After a string of high-profile Senate losses in 2022, including Laxalt’s, top Senate Republicans hoped to recruit candidates who have enough conservative bona fides to win a primary while still appealing to independents to win a general election. Daines believes Brown has enough broad appeal to thread the needle, and was particularly excited by his prowess with small-dollar donors, whopowered himto successive quarters of raising over $1 million in 2022, comingwithin $300,000 of Laxaltin Brown’s strongest quarter. Daines also believes Brown’s story, as a Purple Heart recipient and former small business owner, makes him a strong candidate, said the strategist, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about the NRSC’s plans. Former state assemblyman and prominent election denier Jim Marchant, wholaunched his campaign at the beginning of May, is the only other major Republican candidate who has announced intentions to run for the seat. Havinglostthe 2022 secretary of state race, Marchant, who leaned heavily into conspiracy theories in his last race, could create headaches for the NRSC if he is the Republican nominee — an outcome Democrats are enthused about,per aPoliticoreport. The consultant close to Brown said Daines’ recruitment of him began before Marchant entered the race. The eventual Republican nominee will take on Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), who is running for re-election. Johanna Warshaw, the Nevada state Democratic Party spokesperson, said Brown and Marchant have fundamental similarities. “Sam Brown and Jim Marchant are two anti-choice, MAGA peas in a pod,"" Warshaw said in a statement. ""This is shaping up to be a brutal primary and a messy race to the right that will expose these deeply flawed Republicans as out of touch with hardworking Nevadans.” Brown, a native of Arkansas and West Point graduate, moved to Nevada in 2018 from Texas, where he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Legislature in 2014. Hispolitical positionsare in line with most of the GOP — in 2022, he said he would oppose any law infringing on the Second Amendment, he is anti-abortion, and he blamed runaway government spending for inflation, calling on the Federal Reserve to sharply raise interest rates despite fears of triggering a recession. He supported implementing voter ID laws, and decried the teaching of so-called “critical race theory” in schools, a common conservative belief that schools’ teaching of diversity and inclusion has become divisive. He also called for the elimination of multiple federal agencies, including the departments of energy, education, and transportation, to cut government spending. Brown expressed openness to reforming the legal immigration process to cut down on wait times, but opposed amnesty programs for undocumented immigrants.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/former-nevada-assemblyman-election-denier-jim-marchant-plans-senate-run,True,"Jim Marchant, a former Republican state assemblyman and one of the state’s most prominentelection deniers, is planning to run for Nevada’s U.S. Senate seat in 2024. Marchant, 66, announced his bid Tuesday ata “Make America Great Again” rallyat Fervent Church in Las Vegas, where advertised guests included Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus with ties towhite nationalists, and commentator Wayne Allyn Root. In a speech, he portrayed himself as a principled conservative who would “expose and overcome” what he referred to as deep state media bias, take on censorship of right-wing speech online, and secure the U.S. border with Mexico. “I'm running for United States Senate to protect Nevadans from the overbearing government, from Silicon Valley, from big media, from labor unions, from the radical gender change advocates, where Jacky Rosen has failed you,” Marchant said. “But I will not fail you.” He also touted his business experience in Internet service in Florida, including lobbying then-Gov. Jeb Bush on cyber law and tax issues. Notably, Marchant made no mention of election fraud during his campaign launch — a departure after the topic had become one of his signature issues during a failed 2022 campaign to become Nevada’s secretary of state. Marchant suggested ina 2022 debatethat Nevadans’ votes have not counted for years, and alleged in a January interview withThe Guardianthat a global “cabal” has been manipulating voting machines for years. He also played a key role in pushingseveral rural Nevada countiesto drop electronic voting machines ahead of the 2022 election, citing unsupported conspiracy theories about the machines’ lack of reliability. Marchant is the biggest Republican name so far to enter the race challenging Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), who is up for re-election in 2024. Rosen holds a crucial seat in the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim majority. In his announcement speech, Marchant ran down a host of issues, ranging from typical Republican talking points on crime and undocumented immigrants to saying the Biden administration is pushing digital currency in order to track citizens’ spending as well as kill small banks. In describing each issue, Marchant concluded with a dig at Rosen, saying she was doing nothing to stop the administration, Silicon Valley and communists from having their way. “If America goes to the communists, there's no place else to go,” Marchant said, discussing why the “Hispanics of Nevada” move to the U.S. “Too bad that fact never dawned on Jacky Rosen.” Last cycle, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) narrowly defeated Republican former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt by less than 1 percent or fewer than8,000 votes, making the Nevada Senate seat a tantalizing prospect for Republicans this time around. No other prominent Republicans have announced a bid for the seat. If Marchant comes out victorious, Democrats would lose a seat in a Senate that Democrats control 51-49. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the fundraising and campaign strategy arm for Senate Republicans, declined to comment on Marchant’s campaign. But Nevada Democrats and Democrat-aligned Senate Majority PAC were quick to slam Marchant as a conspiracy theorist. “Now running for Senate, Marchant will set the standard that all his potential Republican primary opponents will have to chase after,” Senate Majority PAC spokesperson Sarah Guggenheimer said. “Given the extent of his conspiratorial thinking, we can’t wait to see them try.” Rosen’s campaign issued a statement calling Marchant as a“MAGA election denier who opposes abortion rights even in cases of rape and incest.” Background and campaign strategy Marchant, born in Gainesville, Florida, won the crowded Republican secretary of state primary in 2022 with37.6 percent of the votewith a campaign that promoted replacing electronic voting machines and implementing hand counting and bolstered false claims that President Joe Biden did not win Nevada during the 2020 presidential election. He lost the bid to political newcomer and Democrat Cisco Aguilarby 2 percentage pointsor nearly 22,000 votes. He also unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2020 but was defeated by incumbent Steven Horsford by nearly 5 percent, or more than 16,000 votes. He has described himself as “a victim of election fraud” in his 2020 race, but a judgedismissed a lawsuitin which he made claims of voter fraud and sought a re-do of the election. Marchant said hismotivation to later runfor secretary of state came from QAnon leader Wayne Willott, who suggested he go out for the job in 2022. Policies he promised to push forward included withdrawing Nevada from Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), an electronic system that helps member states share voter registration information with each other and with the federal government, and allows states to identify duplicate registrations in order to keep their respective voter rolls updated. Marchant also scrutinized mail-in voting and said he wouldbanmail-ballot drop boxes. He said he would also implementvoter ID laws, which would require state identification to vote. He has also expressed “pro-life” or anti-abortion statements, called for the opening of the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Humboldt County and backed abanon “underage transgender treatment.” In an interview following the event, Marchant said he wouldn’t be surprised if he gained the support of former President Donald Trump. But, he added, “I think I can win just on my record.” When asked if he’s worried about capturing voters from certain demographics, he said he is confident that his messaging would resonate with “everybody and all minorities.” He said he heard other Republicans might challenge him, including Sam Brown, who unsuccessfully ran for Senate last year but lost during the primary to Adam Laxalt by 22 percentage points, and April Becker, who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Susie Lee in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District during the same election. A representative for Brown declined to comment. Other speakers at the event, including Clark County Republican Party chair Jesse Law and Washoe County Republican Party chair Bruce Parks, touted Marchant’s conservative bona fides. They described a nation leaving its Christian values behind to pursue a socialist agenda. Many of the speakers also waded into election conspiracies. Dick Morris, a former political advisor to Bill Clinton who resigned over aprostitution scandaland now contributes toNewsmax, plans to advise Marchant’s campaign. He spoke of a campaign strategy that would minimize attacks on Biden and instead focus on “the mob in the street” in order to persuade independent and Democratic voters to join his cause. Morris said he would spotlight a number of issues he believes can win over voters unmoved by crime, immigration and inflation. Referencing popular conspiracy theories, Morris said voters care about the use of genetically modified organisms, government-backed digital currency (which he said would morph into a surveillance operation tracking social credit), bank failures, COVID vaccines and the presence of carcinogens in breast milk. Marchant’s campaign, he said, would be innovative in its message — and puncture the “soft underbelly” of the coalition that has voted for Rosen and other Democrats. He also dinged Rosen as having a low profile. In arecent pollconducted byThe Nevada Independent/ Noble Predictive Insights, Rosen polled favorably, though 13 percent of voters said they had no opinion of her or did not know her. “Jacky Rosen is going to lose because she successfully hides from anybody the fact that she exists,” Morris said, to laughter. “You never hear from her, and she never does anything. What's the Jacky Rosen bill? What’s the Jacky Rosen amendment? What's the last thing she said? “She's a rubber stamp made by Harry Reid, grandfathered into these terms,” he continued. “And there's no constituency.” Gosar and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn also contributed supportive video messages to the event. Marchant’s message, repeated consistently throughout, was that America’s biggest challenges come from actors within the country: the media, the left, the tech sector and Rosen herself. “The most serious threats come not from Beijing, Moscow, Tehran, North Korea,” Marchant said. “They come from Washington. I am running for the U.S. Senate seat from Nevada to preserve our personal liberty in the face of these perils.” Attendees weigh in In interviews after the announcement, voters who attended the event cited a variety of reasons for supporting Marchant in his bid for Senate. Kimmy Linsday, 36, said there should be no separation of church and state in the U.S. and that she will vote Republican down the ticket in next year’s election because she aligns with conservative principles. “I think there's a lot of issues within the Republican Party, but as long as it represents my values, then that's where I'm gonna put my vote,” Linsday said. She also said she would vote Republican because she trusts the party to address the rise of fentanyl overdoses after losing her sister to the drug about three years ago. Linsday said her sister earned about $200,000 a year as a software engineer in Arizona but began using fentanyl during the pandemic to manage pain. “She got addicted to it, and then within six months she died,” Linsday said. Air Force veteran and local physician Jon Maxham, 42, was apolitical up until the 2020 election. He said he “got into the fight” that year because he believed that many of the freedoms he had in his 20s, such as freedom of speech and the right to bear arms, would not exist for his newly growing family. “Many of the ideals that I'm willing to die for were being challenged,” Maxham said. Retired registered nurse Theresa Diaz, 46, said she campaigned for Barack Obama during his first election in 2008 but switched parties at the ballot box that year after a church leader told her that supporting a candidate who supports abortion rights means she will answer to God for the abortions that may follow. Since then, Diaz, who is Roman Catholic, said she hasn’t turned back. “We’re all gonna die and I don’t want God to say ‘I gave you wisdom, why did you not use it?”’ she said.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/biden-winning-hypothetical-matchups-against-trump-desantis-in-nevada,True,"At campaign stops and official events, President Joe Biden likes to frequentlyremindsupporters of a quote he attributes to his father: “Don’t compare me to the Almighty; compare me to the alternative.” And while his approval rating in Nevada remains underwater, a newNevada Independent/ Noble Predictive Insights pollindicated that voters indeed prefer Biden to the Republican alternatives. Among likely voters, Biden leads former President Donald Trump by a substantial 8 points, 48 percent to 40 percent, and edges out Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis by 43 percent to 42 percent. The poll was conducted from April 18 to April 26 of 613 Nevada residents in an online opt-in panel survey. The results have a margin of error of about 4 percent. Biden has significantly improved his margins over each potential Republican foe since an earlyFebruary pollof registered voters, which found him with a 6-point deficit to DeSantis and 2 points behind Trump. Since then, Trump has beenindictedby a grand jury in Manhattan, while DeSantis, who has yet to announce a presidential bid, has fallen in polls after a barrage ofattacksfrom the Trump campaign, a publiclegal battlewith Disney, and adonor exodus. Biden’s approval rating among likely voters in the state — as in the rest of the country — remains low. He sits at 42 percent approval and 53 percent disapproval. Mike Noble, the chief of research and managing partner at Noble Predictive Insights, said the 2022 midterm elections, in which Democrats nationwide notched notable wins against Trump-backed Republican candidates in what is typically a referendum on the president’s party, proved that his low approval rating is not indicative of future electoral failure. “It really depends on who Biden's ultimately running against,” Noble said in an interview on Monday. “If it's Trump, Biden’s job approval is meaningless.” Biden, whobeatTrump in Nevada in 2020 by about 2 percentage points, officially launched his re-election campaign last week. Biden’s favorability sits at 44 percent, slightly higher than his approval rating. Noble said this phenomenon is typical for Biden, whom voters disapprove of on the issues but find relatively likable or inoffensive. He proved most popular among non-Hispanic voters of color, older millennials aged 35 to 44, and Nevadans with postgraduate degrees. Among independents, Biden’s approval rating is a paltry 34 percent. And yet, in a hypothetical rematch with Trump, Biden has a 12-point advantage among independents — a margin that, if it were to hold over the next 18 months, would put purple Nevada firmly out of reach for the former president. Independents are more enthused by DeSantis; the governor has a 1-point advantage over Biden among independents, though 23 percent of those respondents remained unsure of who to support. When polled on Biden’s handling of 11 issues, a majority of likely Nevada voters only approved of his handling of one topic — the COVID-19 pandemic. He also did well on the environment and race relations, relative to his overall 42 percent approval rating. His weakest marks were for his handling of immigration and the economy, each at 60 percent disapproval, followed close by gun policy, which 57 percent of likely voters disapproved of. Democrats also continue to hold a major advantage among women, a trend that emerged after the Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wadein 2022 and which has held in the year since. In a generic congressional ballot, the poll found Democrats held a 6-point advantage over Republicans among all likely voters. When narrowed down to women, the margin expands to a whopping 22-point margin. Noble said polling from April 2022, before the Supreme Court made its ruling, showed Democrats with a 9-point lead with women. “Frankly, abortion has been a buzzsaw issue for the GOP since the Supreme Court decision,” Noble said. “Republicans need to align on a united position and strategy and navigate this issue if they hope to carry female voters come November.” On the generic ballot, Democrats also carried Hispanic voters by 14 percent. And despite having a negative favorability metric with Hispanic voters, Biden carried them in the poll by a margin of 16 and 17 points, respectively, against Trump and DeSantis. Jacky Rosen ratings Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), who is up for re-election in 2024, is polling ahead of Biden. Fifty percent of likely voters had a favorable view of her (compared to 44 percent for Biden) while 36 percent did not. Thirteen percent of voters either had no opinion or had not heard of her, a metric Noble said works to her advantage because she has a long window of time to define herself while Republicans will not even know their candidate until next summer. Rosen’s favorability was strongest among likely voters aged 18 to 44, voters of color, and voters with a postgraduate education. The only groups who viewed her disfavorably, on the whole, were Republicans and rural voters. Given that both Rosen and Biden will be on the ballot in 2024, Biden’s poor approval rating could be a drag on the junior senator. But Noble said that scenario is unlikely given that Rosen can expect a fundraising advantage as a Democrat in a battleground state. Senate Democrats, including Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), racked up enormous cash sums in 2022 and outspent Republican opponents. He also expects the presidential election to juice turnout among young voters, particularly young women who support abortion rights — all good signs for Rosen. “If I'm Rosen, I’d actually be feeling great,” Noble said. “You have a long runway, and you’ve got plenty of financial resources to basically build your armor.” Find the poll toplines and crosstabshere.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/rosen-raises-2-4-million-has-record-6-million-on-hand-after-first-quarter-of-2023,True,"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) raised $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2023, giving her $6 million in her campaign account as she officially begins her re-election bid — a new Nevada first quarter off-year record, according to her campaign. The haul gives Rosen, wholaunchedher re-election campaign Wednesday, a considerable cash advantage against any as-yet undeclared Republican challengers in what’s likely to be one of the nation’s most-watched 2024 Senate contests. Rosen’s totals outpace Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV)’s early 2021 fundraising totals. Nevada’s senior senator raised $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2021 and entered April with $4.66 million in cash on hand — two off-year records that Rosen’s campaign says she has now broken. Cortez Masto continually setfundraising recordsthroughout her campaign. Specific information about individual donors as well as spending totals will not be available until the Federal Election Commission’s first quarter filing deadline of April 15. In 2024, Senate Democrats must defend 23 seats to Republicans’ 10, making Rosen’s seat critical to maintaining the one-seat advantage Democrats hold. Nevada had the closest Senate race in the country in 2022, when Cortez Masto beat Adam Laxalt by less than one percent. Rosen’s campaign forecasts a similarly tight race next year, making the fundraising haul an important tool towards flooding Nevada media markets with her messaging early on, astrategyCortez Masto deployed. ""This will be an expensive and highly competitive race, but Senator Rosen is raising the resources to get her message out about how she's delivering for Nevada as one of the most bipartisan and effective Senators,” campaign finance director Lexie Leventis said in a statement.

Jacky Rosen (D-NV) officially announced her re-election campaign Wednesday morning, giving Senate Democrats a proven incumbent candidate to promote in a tough 2024 map. Rosen, who served one term in the House before flipping a Senate seat in 2018, is running for her second term. Nevada will be an essential part of the Democrats’ map as the party seeks to maintain control of its one-seat majority, which includes defending senators in three states the party lost in the 2020 presidential election. In a campaign launch video, Rosen, who has stressed her bipartisan credentials while remaining loyal to Democratic goals, touted her work on the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. She said a second term would be focused on lowering costs, protecting abortion, safeguarding Social Security and Medicare, and tackling the climate crisis. “What happens in Nevada in 2024 could once again decide control in the Senate,” Rosen said in the video, referring to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-NV) narrow 2022 victory. “Nevada is always a battleground, and this Senate race will be one of the toughest in the country.” No major Republicans have declared candidacies yet.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/indy-qa-cuccinelli-dhs-leader-under-trump-says-he-sees-more-2024-potential-in-desantis,True,"Although Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has yet to officially throw his hat in the ring for a 2024 presidential run, ally Ken Cuccinelli, a former high-ranking Department of Homeland Security official under President Donald Trump, took it on himself to meet with voters in key states to garner support for DeSantis. Cuccinelli, founder of the pro-DeSantis super PAC Never Back Down, took a recent two-week tour through the four early presidential primary states — Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada — as speculation has intensified inrecent weeksthat DeSantis will run. Despite previously working for Trump, Cuccinelli said he is rooting for DeSantis because he believes he has “best chance to win” the election as he has gained popularity in Florida and across the nation, and has “the skills to do the most in the presidency.” Florida law says state officeholdersmust resigntheir positions if they run for a federal office. But Cuccinelli said the Florida Legislature, which has a Republican supermajority, will likely amend or repeal that law. One of DeSantis’ biggest talking points is immigration. As governor he recently proposed banning driver’s licenses for people who are undocumented, whereas Nevada for a decade has made “driver authorization cards” available to noncitizens who pass a driver’s test and obtain insurance in an effort to prevent hit and runs. Cuccinelli said DeSantis has stated that refusing driver’s licenses to undocumented people would “dissuade illegal immigration.” Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general who also led the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency and was acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security under Trump, sat down withThe Nevada Independentduring his visit to Nevada on Wednesday to discuss DeSantis’ approach to immigration and more. The interview below has been edited for brevity and clarity. Q: Why are you vouching for DeSantis to run for president? The natural first part of that question is: I worked for Trump, why not stay with Trump? And I'm proud of the work we did. I was honored to work in the homeland security arena. And I think we did a good job. We could have done better. And we could have done better with more consistent management, with more consistent personnel picks. When you look at what DeSantis has done in the administration of the largest swing state in the country — third largest state in them all — his personnel are in alignment with his goals that he told the voters he was going to pursue. And it's all well-thought out, well-prepared and well-executed. And in the Trump administration we were going in the right direction, but we were often falling forward rather than marching forward. DeSantis is really much more squared away, and I see a lot more opportunity for America to achieve a lot more under his leadership. Plus, eight years instead of four — that's a big deal. I think age will matter more when he's going up against Joe Biden, who shuffles around and literally shows his age. It is time to move on. Joe Biden won in 2020 hiding in his basement. You can't do that in '24. My prediction for 2024 is, if Ron DeSantis is the nominee, the Biden team will not debate him; they will find a reason not to debate because he'll be humiliated. And it's something I think that they would rather just take the heat for than actually go through. DeSantis has the discipline to let [Biden] stumble. I mean, how did President Trump lose the first debate to Joe Biden? The answer is he wouldn't let Joe Biden talk. He lacked the self-discipline in the preparation to address the debate on the terms that would have been most favorable. It's not rocket science. But it is a lot of preparation and a lot of self-discipline. Those are DeSantis' strengths; they’re not Trump's. Q: What advice would you give DeSantis on how to respond to President Trump’s various insults (such as Ron DeSanctimonius)? Well, the way he's been doing it has been very untraditional, very indirect. No direct engagement by name and I would advise him to keep doing that. It's been very effective. For example, when the president tried to attack DeSantis on COVID, of all things, DeSantis just — an ex-baseball player — said “look at the scoreboard.” If you want to hold that up to what Trump did on COVID, it starts to look more dramatically contrasting in favor of the governor. But he didn't do that. He just pointed out, “This is what we did in Florida. People in Florida appreciated enough to re-elect me overwhelmingly.” Q: Why do you think Trump was unable to complete the border wall? What do you think DeSantis would do differently to bring that project to life? So I'll be a little technical here, partly because I'm a lawyer and partly because I was the deputy secretary. Completing the border wall, just to be clear, doesn't mean 2,000 miles of wall. We don't need the whole border walled off. But there are another 700 priority miles that do need it. That's why those coattails are so important. I mean, that is the easiest way to accomplish that, is budget wise. All you need are majorities to do that. Majorities that will go with you. So 51 in the Senate isn't enough. It is on the Democrat side, not on the Republican side, we need like 53. And DeSantis can get us there in the Senate. Whereas, I'm not sure we could get the majority if Trump is at the top of the ticket. And when you talk about completing 700 more miles of border wall, you're talking about billions of dollars and years of work. That stick-to-it-iveness and execution is where the governor has shined. And we patched it together, sort of, in the Trump administration, getting money out of the Department of Defense and other things, but I think DeSantis will do that in a more traditional way with the coalitions necessary to make it work. The fact of the matter is, Joe Biden's open borders policies have really exposed why that's a bad path, especially in the communities along the border. Q: Nevada is in the top 10 most popular destinations for immigrants. How would DeSantis win over voters with immigrant backgrounds or family members with these strict immigration policies? So there's a lot of that in Florida, right? So he's navigated that. And in Florida, the communities are more organized and outspoken than in any other state I can think of. So he's already proven very effective at navigating that. It's working with every community and matching their desires with his political policy goals. And he's just been really good at that. It's part of the turnaround of votes from 2018 to 2022. I think any Republican nominee needs to be effective. And he's already there. He's done a better job of that than anybody else. Trump improved with Hispanic voters and Black voters. Though, on the Black voter front, it went from very little to a little more than very little and it doesn't change races. The Hispanic vote shift does change races. And it can flip states and Nevada being one of them. It's also critical in Florida, not to the same proportion as Nevada. I think making his tough-on-illegal-immigration policies and making them and the benefits of them real to the people who live in his state is the kind of messaging he can take nationwide. And the things you run on as a presidential candidate need to be relevant to people's lives. And they need to be forward looking. E-Verify is a system used to check whether workers are legally present in the U.S. and eligible to work. DeSantisproposes makingits use mandatory. What do you think it will take to get more employers on board with actually using this system? Would Gov. DeSantis want to take this concept national if elected president? The amount and readily availability of welfare is keeping Americans on the couch. I would say that the governor's approach to not just welfare forever for everyone, and shrinking that as a budget necessity, combined with E-Verify, for instance, and other rule of law type policies should go hand-in-hand. And in some places, wages will go up and that costs businesses more, and we pay for that as consumers. But that's how the people at the poorest end of our economic scale improve their standard of living. I don't think that's something to be lamented. One of the things that we don't do as well as we should in the Republican Party is point out how good our policies are for American poor people. And this is an example where — of course, we want businesses to thrive — but we want them to be getting those people off the couch. And frankly, I'd like a president and a Congress that's ratcheting down that welfare spigot. We're bankrupt, if anybody’s noticed yet. But it is an impediment to getting people into the workforce. I would expect him to [take the concept of E-Verify nationally] because he's supported [it] in Florida. Even Sen. Mitt Romney has proposed legislation to make E-Verify permanent. So this has broad appeal within the GOP. And that's the first place the governor's gonna have to earn support. Q: What are your general thoughts about Trump’s immigration policies? How do they compare to DeSantis' immigration policy? DeSantis hasn't spelled out all of his [policies]. He's been very tough on illegal immigration. And when you look at something like E-Verify, Trump did not pursue that. He didn't support, as far as I know, Romney's bill to even make E-Verify permanent. So in that sense, DeSantis is being a little bit tougher on illegal immigration. COVID aside, there really weren't any changes to legal immigration under Trump. And I haven't yet heard the governor speak to that subject on the legal side. Before I was deputy secretary, I ran the legal immigration agency, USCIS [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]. And the Trump White House was very resistant to virtually any changes. They had their legislation that was modeled in Australia, but it was always almost ready. I'm not sure they ever got it proposed. That's the kind of spinning the wheels in the mud you won't get from president DeSantis.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/how-medicare-advantage-could-become-a-marquee-issue-in-nevadas-2024-senate-race,True,"When President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address to Congress in February, he drew a clear distinction on entitlement spending – his administration had pledged to protect Social Security and Medicare, while congressional Republicans were trying to cut them. Republicans in the audience immediately began to drown out the president by shouting, leading to a back-and-forth over entitlement spending now echoing in early campaign messaging from both political parties. Ten days after the State of the Union, the National Republican Senatorial Committee came out with a new ad targeting Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a swing-state Democrat up for re-election in 2024, over Medicare. “You earned your retirement benefits,” theadsays. “You followed the rules. You paid into the system. But Jacky Rosen wants to take them away. Rosen backed Joe Biden’s extreme agenda, putting your Medicare and Social Security at risk. “Tell Jacky Rosen – hands off our benefits,” the ad concludes. Though the 2024 midterms remain more than 600 days away, early Republican campaign attacks against Rosen are centering around a proposed new rule from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for Medicare Advantage, the capitated Medicare Part C program created in the 1990s that pays private insurers to cover seniors’ health care benefits. Nationwide, Medicare Advantage hasexploded in enrollment growthover the past 15 years, with nearly half of seniors on Medicare Advantage plans. In Nevada,47 percentof the 565,000 seniors enrolled in Medicare are on a Medicare Advantage plan. The elevation of Medicare — and the larger issue of seniors’ health care — to a marquee 2024 issue is a strategy that both parties believe can work to their advantage. American Action Network, a political nonprofit advocacy group aligned with Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), has since dropped $2 million on targeted ads accusing vulnerable Democrats of supporting a Biden policy that they claim,armed with an industry study, constitutes a serious cut to Medicare Advantage – an allegation Democrats and health care researchers such as the Kaiser Family Foundation say is a fear-mongering falsity. It comes as a counterpunch asBidenandcongressional Democratshave hammered Republicans for plans tosunsetentitlements,force cutsas part of the debt limit negotiations orraisethe Medicare eligibility age. Republican leadership, recognizing their 2018 midterm losses came after the party attempted to overturn the Affordable Care Act, have mostly backed away from any positions threatening seniors’ Medicare benefits, and want to pin outrage on Democrats instead. McCarthy has stated that Medicare cuts are off the table for House Republicans’ proposed budget. Rosen acknowledged that she has concerns about the proposed rule. But for those who won elections running on that health care wave in 2018, Medicare is an issue they are all too pleased to discuss. Rosen beat then-Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in 2018 by five points – the largest Senate margin posted by a Democrat not named Harry Reid this century. She and others overwhelminglyattributedher wintoone issue: health care. “[In] my last two elections, a lot was on health care,” Rosen said in an interview, when asked if the re-igniting of Medicare as a campaign issue would be an asset for her. “When I went for the Senate, it was about health care.” What is the Biden administration proposing? The NRSC ad targeting Rosen is based on aproposed CMS rulethat estimates a 1 percent increase to payment plans, changes to the risk adjustment model that codes whether or not a service will be covered, and clawing back overpayments to target waste and fraud. Jack Hoadley, a professor at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute and former commissioner of the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, defined the proposed rule as a correction rather than a cut. While traditional Medicare operates on a fee-for-service basis, Medicare Advantage plans use a fixed payment based on averages of what costs they expect to incur, while also including dental and vision coverage (services not covered under traditional Medicare). While traditional Medicare beneficiaries bill directly to CMS, people on Medicare Advantage, also known as Part C, can choose from a number of plans provided by private insurers, which then bill the government. Versions of that model have been around since the 1970s, but the Medicare Advantage program seen today was created in the 1990s and then took on its current form in the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, a priority of then-President George W. Bush. But Medicare Advantage plans code (or identify medical services, which are then billed for) more aggressively than traditional Medicare, Hoadley said. He gave an example of coding a patient’s underlying hypertension, even if they are managing it and have not sought treatment for it, in a Medicare Advantage plan setting a rate when traditional Medicare does not. Due to these coding discrepancies – andsome reports of fraud– Hoadley says the government is essentially overpaying for Medicare Advantage, which is unfair to taxpayers and to beneficiaries of traditional Medicare. The proposed rules attempt to rectify that issue in an effort to balance the system and strengthen Medicare’s future financial stability. “It's an adjustment — a cleaning up of the system,” Hoadley. “It's not like we're going in and saying, ‘Hey, we're just paying too much, we're gonna cut it back.’ The government's not doing that in this proposal. It's trying to make corrections.” Political fodder Republicans and their allies in the insurance agency point to astudyfrom health care consulting firm Avalere Health, estimating that those enrolled in Medicare Advantage will see a $540 reduction in benefits due to the changes in the risk adjustment model, the term for how services get coded. The study argues that the coding changes and the lower growth rate as compared to prior years will amount to smaller rebates from the CMS to Medicare Advantage plans, meaning they will have to make up those funds by either increasing premiums or decreasing benefits. The study was commissioned by the Better Medicare Alliance, an advocacy and research group that supports Medicare Advantage and is funded by large health insurance companies including UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Humana. In a statement, Better Medicare Alliance President and CEO Mary Beth Donahue called Rosen and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) ""champions for Nevada seniors"" and applauded their ""unwavering leadership"" in supporting Medicare Advantage. ""Senators Rosen and Cortez Masto have worked hard to ensure that Nevada seniors are not harmed by CMS’s recent proposed changes to Medicare Advantage,"" she said in an emailed statement. ""We hope that CMS slows down and listens to the concerns of so many Nevadans who have asked the agency to not move forward with the proposed changes and to take the time needed to work with stakeholders on fully evaluating the potential consequences of these proposed changes for millions of seniors and individuals with disabilities.” Republicans say that the 1 percent increase is tantamount to a cut, given that non-food-and-energy inflation is running at a5.6 percent rate. “Jacky Rosen should condemn Joe Biden for cutting nearly 250,000 Nevada seniors' Medicare benefits,” NRSC Spokeswoman Maggie Abboud said in a statement, referencing a story in theLas Vegas Review-Journalciting the Better Medicare Alliance study. But groups such as the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that researches health policy, and Protect Our Care, a left-leaning health advocacy group, say that the proposed rule changes should not significantly alter things for beneficiaries, and point out that the Biden administration increased Medicare Advantage payment rates by8.5 percentlast fiscal year. Lesley Dach, the chair of Protect Our Care, said the insurance industry is invested in maintaining the status quo on Medicare Advantage because those plans offer some of thehighest profit marginsfor insurers. The changes, he said, will ensure the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. (The Medicare Trust Fund’s solvency is onlyprojectedto last through 2028, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; Biden’sbudgetwould extend its solvency for decades through increasing a tax on those earning over $400,000.) Those profit margins protect them from the need to increase premiums if the rule is adopted and overpayments are clawed back – meaning they would have no ethical reason to do so, Dach said. Kaiser’s analysis also notes that critics similarly claimed that changes to Medicare Advantage made in the Affordable Care Act would lead to insurers dropping benefits, but that fear never materialized. Hoadley said beneficiaries could potentially see an increase in premiums if Medicare Advantage plans decide to charge for the services that traditional Medicare does not provide, such as vision and dental insurance. “It may turn out that trying to correct these errors will lead some Medicare Advantage plans to go from being zero premium to maybe having to charge something every month or two to scale back some of those extra benefits,” Hoadley said. “But that would be done in a way to be fairer to all Medicare beneficiaries … as well as taxpayers.” While these risk adjustments have been needed for years, Hoadley said, it has been politically challenging to do so due to the opposition of the insurance industry – and thus, Biden’s plan of pairing the risk adjustment coding changes with a modest increase in payments is a potential way to thread the needle, keeping the government from being overcharged while keeping costs stable for patients. Rosen, a strong supporter of Medicare Advantage, said in a statement that the proposed rule did raise her suspicions. “Our office has made it clear to the administration that there are concerns about how the proposed Medicare Advantage rule changes could impact Nevada seniors,” she said. But she added that Republicans’ pressure campaign over the proposed rule is a tacit acknowledgement of their anti-Medicare stance, not a serious concern. “I'm going to continue to stand up to the administration — this one or any administration — to ensure that any proposed rule changes to Medicare Advantage don't negatively impact Nevada seniors or their benefits,” Rosen said. “And honestly, this is really just a distraction from the fact that Republican leaders [have] sought to target these programs, even sunset some of these programs, like Social Security and Medicare.” Republicans have the insurance industry and doctors, including theAmerican Medical Association, in their corner as skeptics of the rule. The Latin Chamber of Commerce of Nevada also jumped into the debate, saying the proposed rule change would be harmful. But Republicans have been unable to gain a valuable Democratic ally in their campaign — Nevada’s other Senator, Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV). Cortez Masto is widely known as one of the most pro-Medicare Advantage Democrats, bucking the progressive wing of the party, which oftencriticizesthe plans as cash grabs for insurers. She led a bipartisanletter, which drew more Republican signees than Democrats, to the CMS administrator affirming support for the program. But even Cortez Masto says the rule is not a threat to seniors’ health care. “In Nevada, nearly 50% of seniors and individuals with disabilities rely on Medicare Advantage, and I’ve made it clear that if there are changes to the program, they cannot jeopardize Nevadans’ health care access,” the senator said in a statement. “I’m confident the White House understands this, given their proposal, and look forward to working together to make sure Medicare Advantage can continue to meet patients’ health care needs.” Implications for 2024 The NRSC says it plans to hammer Rosen on Medicare, keeping the issue in the public eye. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which boosts Republicans in House races, has already begun attacking Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) over her support of the president and the rule. “Titus would rather run interference for Biden than defend Nevada seniors,” NRCC spokesperson Ben Petersen said in a statement after Biden’s March 15 appearance in Las Vegas. Dan Lee, a political science professor at UNLV, said given how Medicare and Medicaid funding will continue to be in the news as the debate over the debt limit plays out this year, Republicans are wise to try to capitalize on the narrative – particularly because health care has traditionally been a Democratic strength. He attributed Heller’s 2018 loss to an inability to navigate the health care dynamics of the time. Heller was attacked on the right for supporting a “skinny repeal” of Obamacare rather than a wholesale takedown, while he lost support for trying to overturn the part of the law that expanded Medicaid access to more than 200,000 Nevadans, a month afterpublicly promisingat a press conference alongside then-Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) thathe would not support repealing Obamacareand taking insurance coverage away from “tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans.”. With health care back on the chopping block — particularly if Republicans force cuts to Medicaid in debt limit negotiations — the GOP needs to promote its own narrative dinging Democrats as the party endangering health care. Rosen and Democrats, meanwhile, could even lean into the Medicare Advantage discussion as part of the broader Democratic brand of taking on large corporations, Lee said. “That's always been a message that the Democratic Party has tried to push to [its] electoral advantage – going after Big Pharma, Big Oil,” Lee said. “Here, [it’s] going after these insurance companies.” Rosen – who says health care is the topic she hears most about from constituents – said she has a record she is proud to tout. She spoke about capping the price of insulin at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries and making shingles vaccines free for seniors – a personal issue for her, because both of her parents suffered from shingles. “Everything we've done is to ensure that seniors stay healthy,” Rosen said. “And that's the best investment we can make.” Updated on 3/22/23 at 10:39 a.m. to include a statement from Better Medicare Alliance.",Error: Connection error.
https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/d-c-download-what-biden-and-desantis-said-in-las-vegas,True,"In the last week, President Joe Biden and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came to Las Vegas with dueling messages about the state of the country. While neither candidate has officially declared their candidacy for president, their speeches are early indicators of the messages they will hone during the coming months as they attempt to convince Nevadans — and Americans — that they deserve to be the president. In Las Vegas, competing visions of America Neither Biden nor DeSantis have announced their candidacies for president. The election remains more than 18 months away. But Las Vegans would be forgiven for thinking the two were already the major party’s candidates and that the election was imminent. While neither were billed as official campaign events, Biden and DeSantis touted the policies they had enacted as chief executives and derided their political opponents. But that’s about where the similarities ended. The two depicted wildly differing visions of the country and the challenges it faces, portraying the government as a salve to restore affordability and dignity, in the case of Biden, or freedom from left-wing ideology and policy, per DeSantis. In Biden’s America, things are looking up. Inhis first visitto the Silver State since he was a candidate, he spoke about a country being rebuilt from the middle class up, and a restoration of dignity — through lowering prescription drug costs, bringing manufacturing jobs back and protecting and expanding the social safety net. Republicans, he said, threaten that progress, speaking about the ongoing budget battle with the GOP and the threat to democracy that the party has enabled. He described a party gone astray — referring to his positive working relationships with some in the GOP and portraying the influence of extremism as the party having gone awry. “There are a lot of good Republicans from this state that I worked with over the years, and from every other state,” Biden said to a room full of Democrats at a private DNC fundraiser Tuesday night in Las Vegas. “But this is not the same deal. This is a different breed of cat … and the fact of the matter is that they want to undo even the bipartisan things we got done.” He spoke about the crowning policy achievements of his first two years in office — the Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes green energy like battery recycling and electric car manufacturing in Nevada, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, to invest more in chip manufacturing, and lowering the cost of insulin for seniors. At apublic event the next day at UNLV, Biden spoke to an audience of health care professionals in personal terms about the importance of affordable care, from the stress on his family when his father lost his health insurance to the importance of funding cancer research, the disease that claimed his son Beau. He presented the coming election as a clear contrast between Democrats, who want to protect the Affordable Care Act and empower Medicare to negotiate the price of drugs, and Republicans, who want to make cuts to Medicare and have continually voted to repeal the ACA. He also spoke of himself as a steadying hand domestically and globally that had restored confidence in America in the wake of former President Donald Trump’s isolationism and represented a welcome reprieve from the histrionics of the MAGA win of the Republican Party, now represented by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), whom he joked about. “I am — have never been so – optimistic about the chances for America to take back the standard we had where the rest of the world looks to us and we look to them, because we are — as Madeleine Albright said — the essential nation,” Biden said. DeSantis — nearly 40 years younger than Biden and far more combative — painted a much darker picture. In DeSantis’ America, average people are under siege from the left. Florida, he said, is a refuge against the “woke” policies and culture that have driven thousands of Californians to move to Nevada, for example. At hisSaturday speech at Stoney’s Rockin’ Country, ostensibly to promote his new book, DeSantis presented a “blueprint” for defeating the Democratic Party politically and culturally — taking aim at mask and vaccine mandates, critical race theory, prosecutorial reform, gender ideology, refugees and universal vote-by-mail. He cast himself as a warrior for right-wing cultural causes, taking the fight to everyone from Dr. Anthony Fauci to Disney. Florida — with no state income tax, a large economy and higher-performing schools than states that spend more money on education — is a model, he said, for how the U.S. should be run. “In the last four or five years, [there’s] really been a great American exodus away from states governed by leftist politicians imposing leftist ideology into states like Florida that really represented the promised land of freedom,” DeSantis said. In DeSantis’ formulation, the right should offer freedom and sanity, while Biden and the left — aided by people like Hungarian billionaire and megadonor George Soros — have embraced crime, restrictive COVID policies and open borders. Both likely candidates also addressed the declared elephant in the room — Trump. Biden called him out by name, telling supporters at the fundraiser that the former president created more deficit in four years than any other president. While DeSantis did not name him, he told supporters that he ran a tight ship — “no leaks, no drama, no palace intrigue, just daily execution,” he said, drawing an implicit contrast with the Trump White House. The only other declared Republican presidential candidate, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, has yet to visit Nevada, despite making multiple stops in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina in the month since announcing her candidacy. Nevada Republicans will vote fourth in 2024, while Nevada Democrats will go second if states like New Hampshire adopt theproposed Democratic nominating calendar.

https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/in-visit-to-early-state-nevada-desantis-touts-self-as-leader-willing-to-go-on-offense,True,"Hours before Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took to a Las Vegas stage to tout his state as a place “where woke goes to die,” hundreds of people lined the side of Stoney's Rockin' Country bar and funneled into the space where patrons usually line dance. DeSantis visited Las Vegas as part ofthe Florida Blueprinttour, which is outwardly a promotional tour for his new book, butunofficially viewedas a precursor to a presidential run. It’s the latest in a round of visits by DeSantis to early states in the 2024 Republican nominating calendar, and it comes asa recent pollpredicts he would do even better than President Donald Trump in Nevada if he chooses to jump in. “I said you got to go on offense. You can't just sit back and play defense,” DeSantis said during the roughly 40-minute speech to around 1,000 attendees on Saturday, describing himself as an “energetic executive” unafraid to confront the powerful Disney company, fight with public schools he said try to indoctrinate students, and challenge “medical bureaucrats” over COVID policies. He said his philosophy of not being a “potted plant” and leading a swing state “in bold colors, not pale pastels” helped him score a landslide victory last year and contributed to Republican supermajorities in the Florida Legislature. “In the state of Florida, we can say we came, we saw and we have left the Democratic Party for dead,” he added. Among the crowd was 72-year-old William Bilansky. After voting for Trump in 2016 and 2020, Bilansky said he attended the event to learn more about DeSantis in the case he does run for president and challenges Trump in 2024. Bilansky said he approves of how DeSantis is governing Florida and would like to see his leadership at the national level, but he has yet to see DeSantis’ position on international issues — something that would help solidify his vote. And while Bilansky does not agree with some of the things Trump would tweet, he said he would “take mean tweets to what we're going through now with the Biden administration. Any day.” “I’m a Trump supporter. I think Donald Trump’s policies are outstanding, and I think DeSantis’ are pretty close to his,” Bilansky said toThe Nevada Independentbefore the event.“I would truly want to hear more of his worldviews. But right now, knowing what I know now, I would choose Trump.” The tour is being hosted by “And to The Republic,” a nonprofit group with the sole purpose of helping DeSantis reach a national audience,according toPolitico. Before stopping in Nevada, DeSantis visitedtwo cities in Iowa, the first state in Republicans’ presidential nominating order. During the speech, DeSantis listed his priorities ranging from school choice and parents’ rights to immigration and border security (including building the southern border wall) and the fentanyl epidemic — “I think cartels should be treated as terrorist organizations and dealers should be treated like the murderers they are,” he said. The Nevada State Democratic Party held apress conferenceahead of the DeSantis event to “hold Republicans accountable.” Newly elected chair and Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno (D-North Las Vegas) called DeSantis “too extreme for Nevada” and said that while he may attempt to “sell his Florida Blueprint to Nevadans,” voters have “rejected time and time again” the “extreme MAGA agenda.” Although DeSantis, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, is widely considered theleading candidateto challenge former President Donald Trump in 2024, he hasn’t yet publicly announced a presidential bid and is not expected to do so until after the Florida legislative session ends in May. During his time as governor, DeSantis has leaned into the culture wars,banning mask mandatesin schools,signing legislationthat prevents state or local governments from suspending in-person instruction and blocking businesses and government entities from requiring proof of COVID vaccination. “I'm just proud to say that in Florida, we did it our way,” he said in his speech. “When the world went mad, when common sense suddenly became an uncommon virtue, Florida stood as a refuge of sanity, a citadel of freedom for people.” He directed Florida lawmakers torestructure a self-governing Disney districtafter the company publicly opposed a so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill that blocked teaching on sexual orientation and gender identity in lower grades. He won re-election by more than 19 percentage points in 2022, a sharp contrast to 2018, when he won by less than 1 percentage point. “I got 50 percent of the vote but I earned 100 percent of the executive power. And I would use that power to the fullest to advance the agenda that is in the best interest of the state of Florida,” he said. DeSantis has earned the backing of many prominent conservative donors, including Nevada billionaire Robert Bigelow, who, according to theTampa Bay Times, donated$10 millionto DeSantis’ PAC last year — nearly half of what Bigelow has spent to support all other Republican governors. Aside from an introduction from former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who was DeSantis’ roommate during their time together at the Naval Justice School and called DeSantis “America’s best governor,” and from Controller Andy Matthews, who previously led the pro-Laxalt Morning in Nevada PAC, the speech had few specific references to the Silver State. One was a passing mention that Nevada has widespread mail voting, while Florida does not and bans the practice of “ballot harvesting,” or allowing non-family members to turn in another person’s ballot. Judy Sorce-Bauman, 69, said she likes DeSantis because at 44, he is younger and brings “fresh ideas,” especially as President Joe Biden, 80, has been criticized for his age and stuttering. “The current regime in Washington speaks to cognitive decline, inability to form sentences and non-sensible policies. And I think we need to take a different direction,” Sorce-Bauman said. ANevada Independent/ OH Predictive Insights pollfrom last month found that among Nevada voters, DeSantis has a sizable lead over Biden – 42 percent of respondents said they would vote for the Floridian compared with 36 percent who would opt for Biden. That’s a wider lead than Trump had in the same poll. Forty-two percent of voters said they preferred Trump compared with 40 percent who would support Biden. In his closing lines, DeSantis, who said the Biden administration was floundering and had no energy, hinted at national ambitions, calling on Americans to preserve “the sacred fire of liberty.” “It's a responsibility. It's not one I shrink from. It's one that I welcome,” he said. “But I'm very confident that if we step up and do it, and we never back down, that we will be able to turn this country around.”",Error: Connection error.
