Informed by our analysis throughout the semester, we will build our final model to predict the winner of the 2024 US presidential election.




# Origins

Our model is inspired by the simple and powerful Abramowitz model below.

\[
\underbrace{\text{pv2p}}_{\text{incumbent party}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \underbrace{\text{G2GDP}}_{\text{Q2 GDP growth}} + \beta_2 \cdot \underbrace{\text{NETAPP}}_{\text{June Gallup job approval}} + \beta_3 \cdot \underbrace{\text{TERM1INC}}_{\text{sitting pres}}
\]

To compare it with our final model, which uses data limited to 2008 onward, let's find its performance on elections since 2008.





```
## Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE: 3.57
```

```
## Abramowitz LOO-CV prediction error: 5.76 %
```


Instead of the popular vote, let's build upon the model to predict the 2024 winner of the electoral college.

We will use this metric to evaluate our model: leave-one-out root mean square error (LOO-RMSE) of competitive states.

# Modifications

## Sophisticated Models

In preparation for state-level data and indicators that might not be linear, let's replace the linear model with a random forest model and see if the out-of-sample performance improves.


```
## Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE: 2.83
```

```
## Abramowitz LOO-CV prediction error: 2.69 %
```


## Moving from national to state-level

To predict the winner of the electoral college we need to predict the two-party vote share of each state. We will replace the Q2 GDP growth variable from national to state-level, and the June Gallup job approval to state-level presidential polls 20 weeks before the election.






































```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE: 5.27
```

```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE (swing-states): 2.64
```

It seems like the LOO-CV for non-swing states is dragging up the error. Let's try to reduce it by incorporating by sets swing states and non-swing states apart: political calcification.


## Political calcification

Let's incorporate past voting records into the prediction.







```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE: 3.02
```

```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE (swing-states): 2.72
```


## Swing state behavior

Swing states might have inherently different dynamics than other states. For example, they are the battleground states where campaign spending are being focused on. Let's add a flag on whether a state is consider a swing state in that election.







```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE: 2.85
```

```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE (swing-states): 2.31
```


# Prediction

We predict the Democratic two-party vote share for states that we have accurate data. This includes all toss up and likely states.

How about the electoral college?

# Appendix

Here are other ideas that didn't improve the model.

## A later economy

Instead of Q2 GDP growth, Q3 GDP growth comparison is closer to the election.


```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE: 2.94
```

```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE (swing-states): 2.32
```


## Partisanship

Voters might vote along partisan lines. Let's incorporate the party where the incumbent candidate is from.


```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE: 3.06
```

```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE (swing-states): 2.3
```

## A longer horizon for the economy

How about using a GDP growth compared to 3 years ago?


```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE: 2.9
```

```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE (swing-states): 2.32
```

Let's see if this effect hold with 2020 removed.

Here is using Q2 YOY GDP growth with 2020 removed.


```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE: 2.89
```

```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE (swing-states): 2.43
```

Here is using Q2 3-year GDP growth with 2020 removed.


```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE: 2.76
```

```
## State-level Abramowitz LOO-CV RMSE (swing-states): 2.34
```

It turns out that this modification simply teases out the 2020 effect, so we will not use this modification.
