      <description>&lt;p&gt;Code for this post can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeqcho/usa-2024-election-prediction/tree/main/content/post/2024-09-23-week-3-polls&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;today-we-are-getting-more-polls-than-before&#34;&gt;Today, we are getting more polls than before&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The number of polls conducted nationwide and in each state has increased across election cycles. In the plot below, we tallied the number of polls who were completed in August of each election cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/usa-2024-election-prediction/usa-2024-election-prediction/post/2024/09/23/week-3-polls/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&#xA;The number of nationwide polls increased 60\% from 525 in 2016 to 843 in 2024 (and take note that these are the ones ending in August). The same pattern of increase is also observed for each swing state. The question now is then how can we make use of this huge number of polls to predict the election? One way is to sort polls into different grades and use the polls that have higher grades in our predictive models.&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;are-some-polls-better-than-others&#34;&gt;Are some polls better than others?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/&#34;&gt;538&lt;/a&gt; employs a grading scheme to weigh each poll in their models. Here are the distributions of the grades of the polls. In 2024, they changed to using a numeric grade that factors in historical accuracy and methodological transparency.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/usa-2024-election-prediction/usa-2024-election-prediction/post/2024/09/23/week-3-polls/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How economy influences elections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The code for this page can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeqcho/usa-2024-election-prediction/blob/main/content/post/2024-09-11-week-2/index.Rmd&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One measure of the economy is the GDP growth. But do voters care more about the short-term GDP growth in the months leading up to the election, or do they judge the candidate based on the GDP growth &lt;strong&gt;throughout&lt;/strong&gt; their term? We first investigate the Q2 GDP growth, which is by how much did the GDP grow in the second quarter (April, May, June) in the year of the election.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Past US Elections</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/usa-2024-election-prediction/post/2024/09/08/past-us-elections/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We begin by examining recent US elections. (Code for this post is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeqcho/usa-2024-election-prediction/blob/main/content/post/2024-09-08-past-us-elections/index.Rmd&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;). Here I have plotted the two-party vote share of the democratic party and the republican party since 1948 until 2020. The data is provided by the course staff. A dashed line is drawn at the 50% mark and two other dashed lines are drawn at a 5% interval. Notice that since 2000, the margin of winning is within 5% for the past 6 elections, while in fact in the past we see elections where the margins are more than 5% (like 1984 and 1968). Elections in the US are getting very close following &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/book/27424/chapter-abstract/197266061?redirectedFrom=fulltext&#34;&gt;Pendulum Politics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>About Hugo XMin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XMin&lt;/strong&gt; is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal. In fact, this theme does not contain any JavaScript code at all, although on this example website I did introduce some JavaScript code (still relatively simple anyway). The theme does not contain any images, either, and is pretty much a plain-text theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
