      <description>&lt;p&gt;The code for this page can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeqcho/usa-2024-election-prediction/blob/main/content/post/2024-09-11-week-2/index.Rmd&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One measure of the economy is the GDP growth. But do voters care more about the short-term GDP growth in the months leading up to the election, or do they judge the candidate based on the GDP growth &lt;strong&gt;throughout&lt;/strong&gt; their term? We first investigate the Q2 GDP growth, which is by how much did the GDP grow in the second quarter (April, May, June) in the year of the election.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Past US Elections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We begin by examining recent US elections. (Code for this post is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeqcho/usa-2024-election-prediction/blob/main/content/post/2024-09-08-past-us-elections/index.Rmd&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;). Here I have plotted the two-party vote share of the democratic party and the republican party since 1948 until 2020. The data is provided by the course staff. A dashed line is drawn at the 50% mark and two other dashed lines are drawn at a 5% interval. Notice that since 2000, the margin of winning is within 5% for the past 6 elections, while in fact in the past we see elections where the margins are more than 5% (like 1984 and 1968). Elections in the US are getting very close following &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/book/27424/chapter-abstract/197266061?redirectedFrom=fulltext&#34;&gt;Pendulum Politics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>About Hugo XMin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XMin&lt;/strong&gt; is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal. In fact, this theme does not contain any JavaScript code at all, although on this example website I did introduce some JavaScript code (still relatively simple anyway). The theme does not contain any images, either, and is pretty much a plain-text theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
