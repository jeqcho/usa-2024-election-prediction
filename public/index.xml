      <description>&lt;p&gt;We begin by examining recent US elections. (Code for this post is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeqcho/usa-2024-election-prediction/blob/main/content/post/2024-09-08-past-us-elections/index.Rmd&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;). Here I have plotted the two-party vote share of the democratic party and the republican party since 1948 until 2020. The data is provided by the course staff. A dashed line is drawn at the 50% mark and two other dashed lines are drawn at a 5% interval. Notice that since 2000, the margin of winning is within 5% for the past 6 elections, while in fact in the past we see elections where the margins are more than 5% (like 1984 and 1968). Elections in the US are getting very close following &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/book/27424/chapter-abstract/197266061?redirectedFrom=fulltext&#34;&gt;Pendulum Politics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>About Hugo XMin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XMin&lt;/strong&gt; is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal. In fact, this theme does not contain any JavaScript code at all, although on this example website I did introduce some JavaScript code (still relatively simple anyway). The theme does not contain any images, either, and is pretty much a plain-text theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
