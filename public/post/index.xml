      <description>&lt;p&gt;We begin by examining recent US elections. (Code for this post is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeqcho/usa-2024-election-prediction/blob/main/content/post/2024-09-08-past-us-elections/index.Rmd&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;). Here I have plotted the two-party vote share of the democratic party and the republican party since 1948 until 2020. The data is provided by the course staff. A dashed line is drawn at the 50% mark and two other dashed lines are drawn at a 5% interval. Notice that since 2000, the margin of winning is within 5% for the past 6 elections, while in fact in the past we see elections where the margins are more than 5% (like 1984 and 1968). Elections in the US are getting very close following &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/book/27424/chapter-abstract/197266061?redirectedFrom=fulltext&#34;&gt;Pendulum Politics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
